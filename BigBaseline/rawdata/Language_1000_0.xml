'''Agbirigba''' is a [[cant (language)|cant]] (or [[argot]]) based on the Ogbakiri dialect of the Nigerian language [[Ikwerre language|Ikwerre]] of [[Port Harcourt]]. There are about thirty speakers, from a persecuted section of the community.&lt;ref name=AAN&gt;[http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~akinlabi/Agbirigba-Akinlabi-Ndimele.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agbirigba is unintelligible to other speakers of Ikwerre, but the rule for its derivation is simple: the consonant ''t'' is added before every CV syllable (or, more accurately, every CV [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]). Some speakers add an [[epenthetic]] vowel to break up the resulting consonant cluster.

==Derivation==
The addition of the ''t'' results in [[consonant cluster]]s that do not occur in Ikwerre or other local languages. Some speakers pronounce Agbirigba with the resulting clusters. For speakers to break them up with vowels, the vowels are all [[high vowel|high]] (one of the four vowels {{IPA|/i ɪ u ʊ/}}), and match the subsequent vowel in [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]], [[back vowel|backness]], [[nasal vowel|nasality]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. 

An NCV sequence becomes NtCV. For example, ''m̀fù'' 'horn' becomes ''ǹtfù'' or ''ǹtùfù''. 

There are some complications to this: if the following vowel is /a/, with no ATR quality for the epenthetic vowel to match, then the epenthetic vowel will be /i/ or /u/ depending on, apparently, whether the following consonant is coronal or velar, and if the tone of the following syllable (whether CV or CVV) is complex (rising or falling), then the first element of that tone will move to the epenthetic vowel.

;Examples

*''ńkétʃí vò ré ídʒí'' "Nkechi bought a yam"
becomes:
*''ńtkéttʃí tvò tré ítdʒí''
or 
*''ńtíkétítʃí tùvò tíré ítídʒí''

Here all the vowels are ATR, so the epenthetic vowels are /i/ or /u/ depending on whether the following vowel is front (/e/ or /i/) or back (/o/ or /u/). There is no t before the word-initial syllabic nasal in ''Nkechi'' or word-initial vowel in ''iji'', as neither is a CV syllable.

*''ŋ́gɔ́zɪ́ wṹ lêm'' "Ngozi died"
becomes:
*''ńtgɔ́tzɪ́ twṹ tlêm''
or 
*''ńtʊ́gɔ́tɪ́zɪ́ tṹwṹ tílèm''

Here we have some RTR and nasal vowels. With the high&amp;ndash;low tone on ''lêm'', the high element shifts to the epenthetic vowel for ''tílèm''.

In [[language]], an '''analogical change''' is the process of inventing a new [[wikt:Special:Search/element|element]] in conformity with some part of the language system that you already know. For instance, child learns pairs like [[dog]]/dogs, [[cat]]/cats and is then able to form other [[plural]]s. The way in which [[analogy]] can lead to a change is seen when the child learns words like [[man]] and [[mouse]], and forms the analogical plurals mans and mouses (instead of men and mice).&lt;ref&gt;Barber, C. (2009) The English language A Historical Introduction second edition, p47&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23470">The '''Anglophone Problem''', as it is commonly referred to in [[Cameroon]], is a socio-political issue rooted in Cameroon's colonial legacies from the [[Scramble for Africa|Germans]], [[British colonization of Africa|British]], and the [[Scramble for Africa|French]].

The issue classically and principally opposes many Cameroonians from the Northwest and Southwest regions, many of whom consider themselves anglophones, to the Cameroon government. This is based on the fact that these two regions (formally [[Southern Cameroons|British Southern Cameroons]]) were controlled by Britain as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] and [[United Nations trust territories|trust territory]] of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] respectively." 

== Background ==
While many Northwesterners and Southwesterners believe there is an anglophone problem, some do not. In fact, the term "anglophone" today creates a lot of controversy, as many former [[French language|French-speaking]] Cameroonians who are either bilingual or speak only English (most of whom have gone through the English sub-system of education) consider themselves as anglophones. The root of the Anglophone problem in Cameroon can be traced back to the Foumban Conference of 1961 that united the two territories, with different colonial legacies, into one state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Anglophone Problem is increasingly dominating the political agenda of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konings|first=Piet|year=1997|title=The Anglophone Problem in Cameroon|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem has led to arguments and actions (protests, strikes, etc.) that argue for [[federalism]] or separation from the union by the Anglophones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to address the Anglophone Problem threatens Cameroon's ability to create national unity between the two groups of people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origins ==

=== The European colonizers ===
The roots of the Anglophone problem can be traced back to [[World War I]], when Cameroon was known as [[Kamerun|German Kamerun]]. The [[German Empire]] first gained influence in Cameroon in 1845 when Alfred Saker of the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] introduced a mission station.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|isbn=0-313-27917-9|location=|pages=169|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, German merchants established a factory: the Woermann Company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On July 5, 1884, local tribes provided the Woermann Company with rights to control the Kamerun River, consequently setting the foundation for the later [[German colonization of Africa|German colonization]] of Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1916, during World War I, [[French colonial empire|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] joined forces to [[Kamerun Campaign|attack and seize]] German Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] would award France and Britain mandates over Cameroon as punishment of the Germans who lost the war. Most of German Kamerun was given to the French, over 167,000 square miles of territory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The British were given [[British Cameroons|Northern Cameroons]], about 17,500 square miles of territory and [[Southern Cameroons]], 16,580 square miles. Each colonizer would later influence the colonies with their [[European languages]] and cultures, thus rendering them as Anglophones and Francophones. The large difference in awarded territory has resulted in present-day Cameroon having a huge majority Francophone population and a very small minority Anglophone population.

=== Gaining independence ===
Following [[World War II]], a wave of independence flowed rapidly throughout Africa. The [[United Nations]] obliged that Britain and France relinquish their colonies and guide them towards independence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cameroon-info.net/article/cameroon-bamenda-provincial-episcopal-conference-memorandum-to-president-paul-biya-on-the-current-situation-in-278001.html|title=Bamenda Provincial Episcopal Conference [BAPEC]|last=Anglophone Archbishops|first=|date=December 22, 2016|work=newspaper|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three political options for British Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They could become independent by uniting with [[Nigeria]] or with [[French Cameroons|French Cameroun]]. No option of self-determination by becoming independent was given.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most desired option was independence with the least popular being unification with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, during the [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|British Plebiscite of 1961]], the British argued that Southern Cameroons was not economically viable enough to sustain itself as an independent nation and could only survive by joining with Nigeria or La République du Cameroun (the Republic of Cameroon).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though documents on the United Nations' "Non-Self-Governing Territories" state, "integration should be the result of the freely expressed wishes of the territory's peoples",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International organisation and integration: a collection of the texts of documents relating to the United Nations, its related agencies and regional international organisations|last=Van Panhuys|first=H.F|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media Dordrecht|year=1968|isbn=978-1-4899-6229-4|location=|pages=288|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations would later reject Southern Cameroons' appeal to have independence as a sovereign nation placed on the ballot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The plebiscite questions were:   
# ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Federation of Nigeria?'' 
#  ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Republic of Cameroun?''
The United Nations documents defined the basis of integration as: "Integration with an independent State should be on the basis of complete equality between the peoples of the erstwhile Non-Self-Governing Territory and those of the independent country with which it is integrated. The peoples of both territories should have equal status and rights of citizenship... at all levels in the executive, legislative and judicial organs of government."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With this promise in mind, on [[February 1961]], British Northern Cameroons voted to join Nigeria, while British Southern Cameroons voted to join La République du Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern West Cameroon Revisited (1950-1972): Unveiling Inescapable Traps|last=Ndi|first=Anthony|publisher=Langaa RPCIG|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Foumban Conference of July 17–21, 1961 ===
The purpose of the [[Foumban Constitutional Conference]] was to create a [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] for the new Federal state of British Southern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun. The conference brought together representatives from La République du Cameroun, including [[Ahmadou Ahidjo|Amadou Ahidjo]], their president, with representatives from Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A study of the politics of recognition and representation in Cameroon|last=Konings|first=Piet|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2003|isbn=9004132953|location=Netherlands|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the Foumban Conference, there were reports that more than one hundred people were killed by terrorists in Loum, [[Bafang]], Ndom, and [[Douala]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africafederation.net/SouthernCameroon.htm|title=The Legal Argument for Southern Cameroon Independence|last=Dounge|first=Germanus|date=January 18, 2017|website=www.africafederation.net|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports worried unification advocates who wanted British Cameroon to unify with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For the conference, the location of Foumban had been carefully chosen to make Ahidjo, appear as if he had everything under control. Mr. Mbile, a Southern Cameroonian representative at the conference noted, "Free from all the unrest that had scared Southern Cameroonians, the Francophone authorities had picked the place deliberately for the occasion. The entire town had been exquisitely cleaned up and houses splashed with whitewash. Food was good and receptions lavish. The climate in Foumban real or artificial went far to convince us that despite the stories of 'murder and fire,' there could be at least this island of peace, east of the Mungo."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Before the Foumban Conference, all the parties in Southern Cameroons, the Native Authority Councils and the traditional leaders attended the [[Bamenda Conference]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This conference decided on a common proposal to present when negotiations with La République du Cameroun arrived. Among many things, the Bamenda Conference agreed on a non-centralized federation to ensure there was a distinction between the powers of the states and the powers of the federation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Most of the proposals from the Bamenda Conference were ignored by Ahidjo.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anglophone Cameroon Predicament|last=Atanga|first=Mufor|publisher=Langaa Research &amp; Publishing CIG|year=2011|isbn=9956717118|location=Bamenda|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these proposals included having a [[bicameral]] legislature and decentralizing power, but instead a [[unicameral]] system was established with a centralized system of power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At the Foumban conference, Ahidjo presented delegates with a draft constitution. By the end of the conference, instead of creating an entirely new constitution, the contributions of the Southern Cameroons delegates were reflected in suggestions made to the draft initially presented to them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[John Ngu Foncha]] and Ahidjo intended for the Foumban Constitutional Conference to be brief, however delegates left the three day conference with the impression that there would be sequential conferences to continue the drafting of the constitution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Mbile later noted, "We may have done more if we had spent five months instead of five days in writing our constitution at Foumban."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Constitution for the new Federal Republic was agreed in Yaoundé in August 1961, between Ahidjo and Foncha, pending approval by the House of Assembly of the two states.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the end, the West Cameroon House of Assembly never ratified the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, on October 1, 1961, the Federal Republic of Cameroon nevertheless came to fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On May 6, 1972, Ahidjo announces his decision to convert the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] into a [[unitary state]], on the provision that the idea was supported via referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggestion violated the articles in the Foumban document that read: 'any proposal for the revision of the present constitution, which impairs the unity and integrity of the Federation shall be inadmissible,' and 'proposals for revision shall be adopted by simple majority vote of the members of the Federal Assembly, provided that such majority includes a majority of the representatives ... of each of the Federated States,'... not through referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such violations easily allowed for the passing of the referendum that turned the Federal Republic into the United Republic of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking into account these actions, the evidence shows that the Francophone's intentions may have not been to form a federal state, but rather to annex Southern Cameroons and not treat them as equals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1984, Ahidjo's successor, [[Paul Biya]], replaced the name "United Republic of Cameroon" with "La République du Cameroun," the same name the francophone Cameroon had before federation talks.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achankeng|first=Fonkem|year=2014|title=The Foumban "Constitutional" Talks and Prior Intentions of Negotiating: A Historico-Theoretical Analysis of a False Negotiation and the Ramications for Political Developments in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective|volume=9|pages=149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With changes in the Constitution of 1996, reference to the existence of a territory called the British Southern Cameroons that had a "functioning self-government and recognized international boundaries" was essentially erased.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== The Anglophone problem ==
Despite the non-acknowledgement/denial of the Anglophone problem from Francophone government leaders,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; there exists a discontent by Anglophones, both young and old, as to how Anglophones are treated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This discontent presents itself in calls for federation or separation with movements that are garnering strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the core of Anglophone grievances is the loss of the former West Cameroons as a "distinct community defined by differences in official language and inherited colonial traditions of education, law, and public administration."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eyoh|first=Dickson|year=1998|title=Conflicting Narratives of Anglophone Protest and the Politics of Identity in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2016, in a letter to [[Paul Biya]], the Anglophone Archbishops of Southern Cameroons define the Anglophone problem as follows:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The failure of successive governments of Cameroon, since 1961, to respect and implement the articles of the Constitution that uphold and safeguard what British Southern Cameroons brought along to the Union in 1961.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The flagrant disregard for the Constitution, demonstrated by the dissolution of political parties and the formation of one political party in 1966, the sacking of Jua and the appointment of [[Salomon Tandeng Muna|Muna]] in 1968 as the Prime Minister of West Cameroon, and other such acts judged by West Cameroonians to be unconstitutional and undemocratic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# The cavalier management of the 1972 Referendum which took out the foundational element (Federalism) of the 1961 Constitution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The 1984 Law amending the Constitution, which gave the country the original East Cameroon name (The Republic of Cameroon) and thereby erased the identity of the West Cameroonians from the original union. West Cameroon, which had entered the union as an equal partner, effectively ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The deliberate and systematic erosion of the West Cameroon cultural identity which the 1961 Constitution sought to preserve and protect by providing for a bi-cultural federation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Separation ===
Movements which advocate the separation of English-speaking Cameroon from French-speaking Cameroun exist, led by the [[Cameroon Action Group]], the [[Southern Cameroons Youth League]], the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]], the [[Southern Cameroon Peoples Organization]] and the [[Ambazonia Movement]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Federation ===
Advocates of Federation want a return to the constitution agreed upon in the 1961 Foumban Conference that acknowledges the history and culture of the two regions while giving equal power to the two.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This federation had been dismantled on 20 May 1972 by the larger French-speaking Cameroon and extended the latter's executive power throughout West Cameroon.  Federation advocates include the instrumental Consortium of the leaders of three Cameroon-based trade unions: Lawyers, Teachers, and Transporters. It also includes some Cameroonians in the diaspora led by a well organized US-based Anglophone Action Group, Inc. (AAG).  AAG was one of the first groups in the diaspora to endorse the Cameroon-based Consortium as a peaceful alternative to achieving a return to the pre-1972 federated system. Opponents of federation include the ruling [[Cameroon Peoples Democratic Movement]].

=== Unitary ===
Unitarianism do not want Federation or Separation, but rather a decentralized unitary government; whereas, now the government is highly centralized in power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This violates the tenets of the 1996 Constitution as decentralization has yet to be implemented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Struggle for political representation ==
In March 1990, the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF) led by [[John Fru Ndi]], was founded on the perception of widespread Anglophone alienation. The SDF was the first major opposition party to the People's Democratic Movement, led by Paul Biya.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Symptoms of Anglophone discontent ==
Below are various reasons that Anglophones feel marginalized, systemically, by the government. 
* The National Entrance Examinations into Schools that develop the human resources of Cameroon are set by the French Subsystem of Education. This makes it difficult for Anglophones and Francophones to compete on an equal playing field. The Examination Board members are all Francophone, which places some bias against Anglophone candidates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* There are five Ministries that concern education and none of them are Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Of the 36 Ministers who defended the budgets for the Ministries last month, only one was Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* In the 1961 Constitution, the Vice President was the second most important person in state protocol. Today, the Prime Minister (appointed Anglophone) is the fourth most important person in State Protocol, after the President of the Senate and the President of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Prioritization of French over English ===

* State institutions put documents and public notices in French, with no English translations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* National Entrance Examinations into some professional schools are set in French only, sometimes even in English-speaking regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most of the heads of government offices only speak French, even in the English-speaking regions. Visitors and clients to government offices are then expected to speak in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most Senior Administrators and members of the Forces of Law and Order in the Northwest and Southwest Regions are French-speaking and there is a lack of effort for them to demonstrate an understanding of anglophone culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* Members of Inspection Teams, Missions and Facilitators for Seminars sent from the Ministries in Yaoundé to Southern Cameroon are mostly French speaking, and English speaking audience are expecting to understand them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* Most of the Military Tribunals in the Northwest and Southwest Regions conduct their courts in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Finance documents such as the COBAC Code, the CIMA Code and the [[OHADA]] Code are all in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* The Magistrates in the Southern Cameroon regions are disproportionately Francophone. In addition, other government-appointed officials such as the Senior Divisional Officers, the Divisional Officers, Commissioners, and Commandants are disproportionately Francophone. There are Francophone principals in Anglophone schools, and Hospitals, Banks and Mobile Telephone Companies are predominantly Francophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Spiraling ==
{{As of|2017}}, the Anglophone problem is still on-going. It has spiraled into violence with police officers and gendarmes shooting dead several civilians. Official sources have put the number at 17 dead, but local individuals and groups have talked of 50 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/10/02/cameroon-s-anglophone-crisis-resulted-in-17-deaths-amnesty//|title=Cameroon's Anglophone crisis resulted in 17 deaths - Amnesty {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical members of some secessionist groups have killed several police officers and gendarmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/11/29/four-soldiers-killed-in-cameroon-s-anglophone-region//|title=Four soldiers killed in Cameroon's Anglophone region {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15,000 refugees have fled Southern Cameroons into neighboring Nigeria, with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] expecting that number to grow to 40,000 if the situation continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1179202/cameroons-anglophone-crisis-is-threatening-to-spin-out-of-control/|title=Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis is threatening to spin out of control|last=Dahir|first=Abdi Latif|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
Without clearly acknowledging the existence of the Anglophone problem, the President of Cameroon has attempted to appease tensions by making a number of announcements:
* President Biya ordered the creation of a Common Law department at the Supreme Court and the School of Administration and Magistracy, ENAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameroonpostline.com/biya-orders-creation-of-common-law-depts-at-supreme-court-enam/|title=Biya Orders Creation Of Common Law Depts At Supreme Court, ENAM {{!}} CameroonPostline|website=www.cameroonpostline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 2017 traditional end-of-year address, he announced there will be an effective decentralization scheme implemented by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/16-president-paul-biya-to-the-nationzzz|title=President Paul BIYA to the Nation|website=www.prc.cm|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of decentralization is one of the major tenets of [[Constitution of Cameroon#Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon of 1996|Cameroon's 1996 constitution]] which was spearheaded by the Anglophone opposition groups in parliament.
[[List of active separatist movements in Africa|Several separatist or secessionist groups]] have emerged or become more prominent as a result of the harsh response by the government to the Anglophone problem. These groups desire to see Southern Cameroons completely separate from ''[[Cameroon|La République du Cameroun]]'' and form its own state, sometimes referred to as ''[[Ambazonia]]''. Some groups such as the ''Southern Cameroon Ambazonia United Front'' (SCACUF) are using diplomatic means in an attempt to gain independence for the Anglophone regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ambagov.org/|title=Click To Learn More About The Interim Government of Ambazonia - AmbaGov|website=ambagov.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other groups have begun to employ armed confrontation with artisan weapons against the deployed gendarmes and soldiers in those regions.

'''The Association of Translation Companies (ATC)''' is a professional membership association promoting language services in the [[United Kingdom]] and beyond. The ATC represents the interests of translation companies operating in the UK’s expanding language services industry which is home to over 1,500 translation companies, is worth more than £1 billion and employs more than 12, 000 people.

The ATC’s stated vision is to create recognition and trust for [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] by promoting and regulating quality-driven language industry standards and best practice, and to support and nurture its members for sustainability and growth.

== Organisation ==
The Association of Translation Companies Ltd is governed by a volunteer Council elected from ATC member companies. The association’s direction is set by the [[Council]], led by its elected Officers: Chair, Vice Chair and Treasurer. Responsible for implementing the Council’s vision and strategy is the ATC’s [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] who heads the association’s activities supported by its Secretariat.

In addition to convening a minimum of four times a year, Council members actively participate in the association’s committees and lead its projects.

== Objectives ==
The ATC’s promotes quality-driven professional language services for the benefit of its member companies. The association’s activities serve the needs of the people, businesses and [[Public sector|public-sector organisations]] commissioning translation, interpreting and other language services.

The Association provides specific information to translation buyers about members’ specialities; speaks with authority to Government on matters concerning the profession; provides information and assistance to business, industry and members of the public who wish to use the services of a language service provider.

Its objectives are to:

* Promote the interests and use of ATC member companies;
* Promote and further the interests of the translating profession generally;
* Promote, publish and enforce a Code of Professional Conduct for its members;
* Arbitrate in matters concerning members and clients;
* Establish, maintain and promote the adoption of rigorous quality systems by its members;
* Ensure that the interests of those purchasing translations are protected by ensuring that its members carry full professional [[Indemnity|indemnity insurance]];
* Promote co-operation among members and others within the translation profession;
* Publish information about the translation profession and matters of interest to translation purchasers;
* Promote greater use of professionally-produced translations by those seeking to sell and communicate worldwide.

== History ==
The Association of Translation Companies was formed in 1976 by leading British [[translation]] companies keen to promote the use of professionally produced, high quality, translation work by professional translation companies, to support the UK’s exporters.

Since its inception, the ATC has played a pivotal role in the development of [[European Union|European]] language services. It was the driving force behind the establishment of the European Union of Associations of Translation Companies, and one of the original developers of the European translation services standard EN 15038, a precursor to the international translation services standard ISO 17100.

== Membership ==

=== Full Member ===
Membership is available to established companies able to provide full accounts of the previous three trading years. A minimum of 65% of the company’s core business must be the provision of translation services.

=== Supported Start-up ===
Membership of the ATC as a Supported [[Startup company|Start-up]] is available to start-up Language Service Provider businesses that have been trading for over six months who are able to provide the supporting documents in the ATC’s Eligibility and Criteria section.

=== Corporate Partner ===
Membership is available to translation [[Department|departments]]{dn|date=November 2018}} within companies whose core business may be in any sector.

=== Accredited Partner ===
Accredited Partner status is available to those companies who are stakeholders in the translation industry, for example office furniture suppliers.

=== Technology Partner ===
Technology Partner status is available to those companies supplying hardware or software specifically tailored to the translation business.

== Activities ==
The ATC organises regular networking and training events and [[Web conferencing|webinars]], and hosts an annual conference, the Language Industry Summit. The association publishes an annual Language Industry Survey, charting the state of the language services industry in the UK.

The ATC speaks with authority on the economic case of languages for the future of the UK’s international trade and exporting and supports several research activities and government lobbying initiatives.

== ATC Certification Stamp ==
Full ATC member companies have the use of the ATC Certification Stamp, which maybe be used to certify official translations such as certificates. The stamp carries the member’s name, membership number, the current year, and the stamp line “The mark of quality-managed translation service”.

'''Auditory processing disorder''' ('''APD'''), also known as '''central auditory processing disorder''' ('''CAPD'''), is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes [[Sound|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Academy of Audiology|title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis, Treatment and Management of Children and Adults with Central Auditory|url=http://audiology-web.s3.amazonaws.com/migrated/CAPD%20Guidelines%208-2010.pdf_539952af956c79.73897613.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle, and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do, which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the [[central nervous system]].

The American Academy of Audiology notes that APD is diagnosed by difficulties in one or more auditory processes known to reflect the function of the central auditory nervous system.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010" /&gt;

APD can affect both children and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It has been suggested that males are twice as likely to be affected by the disorder as females,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/hcs/resources/capd/capd/index.html |title=(C)APD|author= La Trobe University |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Musiek |first1=Frank |authorlink1= |last2=Gail |first2=Chermak |authorlink2= |title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder |trans-title=auditory neuroscience and diagnosis |year= 2007|publisher= Plural Publishing|isbn= 1-59756-056-1|pages= 448}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no good epidemiological studies.

==Presentation ==
CAPD can continue into adulthood. Cooper and Gates (1991) estimated the prevalence of adult APD to be 10 to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;(Cooper JC Jr., Gates GA. Hearing in the elderly – the Framingham cohort, 1983–1985: Part II.  Prevalence of central auditory processing disorders. Ear Hear. 1991;12(5):304–311)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people experience problems with learning and day-to-day tasks with difficulties over time.

* talk louder than necessary
* have trouble remembering a list or sequence
* often need words or sentences repeated
* have poor ability to memorize information learned by listening
* interpret words too literally
* need assistance hearing clearly in noisy environments
* rely on accommodation and modification strategies
* find or request a quiet work space away from others
* request written material when attending oral presentations
* ask for directions to be given one step at a time

===Relation to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===

It has been discovered that APD and [[ADHD]] present overlapping symptoms. Below is a ranked order of behavioral symptoms that are most frequently observed in each disorder. Professionals evaluated the overlap of symptoms between the two disorders. The order below is of symptoms that are almost always observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail D.|last2=Somers|first2=Erin K.|last3=Seikel|first3=J. Anthony|title=Behavioral signs of central auditory processing disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of American Academy of Audiology|date=1998|page=78-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart proves that although the symptoms listed are different, it is easy to get confused between many of them.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

There is a high rate of co-occurrence between AD/HD and CAPD. An article published in 1994 showed that 84% of children with APD have confirmed or suspected ADHD. Co-occurrence between ADHD and APD is 41% for children with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 43% for children suspected of having ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RICCIO|first1=CYNTHIA A.|last2=HYND|first2=GEORGE W.|last3=COHEN|first3=MORRIS J.|last4=HALL|first4=JOSH|last5=MOLT|first5=LAWRENCE|title=Comorbidity of Central Auditory Processing Disorder and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=July 1994|volume=33|issue=6|pages=849–857|doi=10.1097/00004583-199407000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''more recently published data is needed to support or refute this statement.'' 
===Relation to specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia===

There has been considerable debate over the relationship between APD and [[Specific language impairment|Specific language impairment (SLI)]].

SLI is diagnosed when a child has difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot be explained in terms of peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing or understanding complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=C. A.|year=2011|title= Auditory processing theories of language disorders: Past, present, and future.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume=42|issue=3|pages=309–319|doi= 10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0040)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1= M. A.|last2=Hall|first2=R. L.|last3= Riley|first3=A|last4= Moore|first4= D. R.|year=2011|title=Communication, listening, cognitive and speech perception skills in children with auditory processing disorder (APD) or specific language impairment (SLI)|journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=211–227| doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2010/09-0167)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing. Where a child has both auditory and language problems, it can be hard to sort out cause-and-effect.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;

Similarly with [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], there has been considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect can be hard to unravel. This is one reason why experts such as Moore&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD. Specifically regarding the neurological factors of dyslexia, the disorder has been linked to [[polymicrogyria]] which causes cell migrational problems. This relates to APD because children that have polymicrogyri almost always present deficits on APD testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail|last2=Musiek|first2=Frank|title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder. comprehensive intervention|date=2014|publisher=Plural Publishing|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-59756-562-2|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that APD may be related to [[cluttering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pindzola, Rebekah H. |author2=Haynes, William O. |author3=Moran, Michael J. |title=Communication disorders in the classroom: an introduction for professionals in school setting |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=251 |isbn=0-7637-2743-1 |oclc=59401841 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fluency disorder marked by word and phrase repetitions.

It has been found that a higher than expected proportion of individuals diagnosed with SLI and dyslexia on the basis of language and reading tests also perform poorly on tests in which APD is tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=David R.|title=Auditory processing disorders: Acquisition and treatment|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=July 2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=295–304|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; APD can be assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, and a child may do poorly because of primary language problems.&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'/&gt; In a study comparing children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawes|first1=P|last2=Bishop|first2= D|year=2010|title=Psychometric profile of children with auditory processing disorder (APD) and children with dyslexia|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=95|pages=432–436|doi=10.1136/adc.2009.170118|pmid=20501538|pmc=3576918}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1= C.A.|last2=Wagstaff|first2=D.A.|year=2011 |title=Behavioral profiles associated with auditory processing disorder and specific language impairment.|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=44|issue=6|pages=745–763 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2011.04.001|pmc=3174343}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained similar findings in studies comparing children diagnosed with SLI or APD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corriveau K, Pasquini E, Goswami U |title=Basic auditory processing skills and specific language impairment: a new look at an old hypothesis |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=647–66 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17538107 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/046) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dlouha O, Novak A, Vokral J |title=Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Central auditory tests |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=903–7 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17382411 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.02.012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups had very similar profiles. This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely a function of the specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt;

==Causes==

===Acquired auditory processing disorder===
Acquired APD can be caused by any damage to or dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system and can cause auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Musiek FE, Chermak GD, Weihing J, Zappulla M, Nagle S |title=Diagnostic accuracy of established central auditory processing test batteries in patients with documented brain lesions |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=342–58 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21864472 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.22.6.4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lew HL, Weihing J, Myers PJ, Pogoda TK, Goodrich GL |title=Dual sensory impairment (DSI) in traumatic brain injury (TBI)--An emerging interdisciplinary challenge |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20448311 |doi=10.3233/NRE-2010-0557 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an overview of neurological aspects of APD, see Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=T. D.|year=2002|title=Central auditory pathologies. |journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=63|issue=1|pages=107–120| doi=10.1093/bmb/63.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hereditary and genetic characteristics of central auditory processing disorder===
The ability to listen to and comprehend multiple messages at the same time is a trait that is heavily influenced by our genes say federal researchers.&lt;ref&gt;("Genetics Influence Auditory Processing." Psych Central.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; These "short circuits in the wiring" sometimes run in families or result from a difficult birth, just like any learning disability.&lt;ref&gt;(NCLD.org – NCLD." National Center for Learning Disabilities | NCLD.org.)&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory processing disorder can be associated with conditions affected by genetic traits, such as various developmental disorders. Inheritance of Auditory Processing Disorder refers to whether the condition is inherited from your parents or "runs" in families.&lt;ref&gt;("Inheritance and Genetics of Auditory Processing Disorder." – RightDiagnosis.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Central auditory processing disorder may be hereditary neurological traits from the mother or the father.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Developmental auditory processing disorder===
In the majority of cases of developmental APD, the cause is unknown. An exception is acquired epileptic [[aphasia]] or [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], where a child's development regresses, with language comprehension severely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fandiño M, Connolly M, Usher L, Palm S, Kozak FK |title=Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a rare auditory processing disorder series of cases and review of the literature |journal=Int.

In the 1980s and 1990s, there was considerable interest in the role of chronic [[Otitis media]] (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems.

== Questionnaires for identifying or documenting listening problems. ==
Questionnaires can be used for the identification persons with possible auditory processing disorders, as these address common problems of listening. They can help in the decision for pursuing clinical evaluation.

They include:

* Difficulty hearing in noise
* Auditory attention problems
* Better understanding in one on one situations
* Difficulties in noise localization
* Difficulties in remembering oral information

According to the New Zealand Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorders (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Keith, W.J., Purdy, S.C., Baily, M., Kay, Flora.  Draft of New Zealand APD Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorder (2018) Published by the Auditory Processing Disorders Reference Group, New Zealand Audiological Society.  &lt;/ref&gt; a checklist of key symptoms of APD or comorbidities that can be used to identify individuals who should be referred for audiological and APD assessment includes, among others:

* Difficulty following spoken directions unless they are brief and simple
* Difficulty attending to and remembering spoken information
* Slowness in processing spoken information
* Difficulty understanding in the presence of other sounds
*Overwhelmed by complex or “busy” auditory environments e.g. classrooms, shopping malls
*Poor listening skills
* Insensitivity to tone of voice or other nuances of speech
*Acquired brain injury
*History of frequent or persistent middle ear disease (otitis media, ‘glue ear’).
*Difficulty with language, reading or spelling
*Suspicion or diagnosis of dyslexia
*Suspicion or diagnosis of language disorder or delay

Finally, the New Zealand guidelines state that behavioral checklists and questionnaires should only be used to provide guidance for referrals, for information gathering (for example, prior to assessment or as outcome measures for interventions), and as measures to describe the functional impact of auditory processing disorder.  They are not designed for the purpose of diagnosing auditory processing disorders. The New Zealand guidelines indicate that a number of questionnaires have been developed to identify children who might benefit from evaluation of their problems in listening.  Examples of available questionnaires include the Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist (1976&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, L. I. (1976). ''Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist''. Tampa, FL . The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), the Children’s Auditory Performance Scale (1998&lt;ref&gt;Smoski, W.J., Brung, M.A.. and Tannahill, J.C., (1998) Children’s Auditory Performance Scale,  Tampa, FL: The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), the Screening Instrument for Targeting Educational Risk (1989&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K. (1989). ''SIFTER: Screening instrument for targeting educational risk in children identified by hearing screening or who have known hearing loss''. Tampa, FL The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Auditory Processing Domains Questionnaire (O’Haraa and Mealings, 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Hara |first1=Brian |last2=Mealings |first2=Kiri |title=Developing the auditory processing domains questionnaire (APDQ): a differential screening tool for auditory processing disorder |journal=International Journal of Audiology |date=31 July 2018 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1080/14992027.2018.1487087 |pmid=30063869|url=https://dspace.nal.gov.au/xmlui/handle/123456789/931}}&lt;/ref&gt;) among others. All of the previous questionnaires were designed for children and none are useful for adolescents and adults.

(2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Del Zoppo|first=C.|last2=Sanchez, L.|last3=Lind, C.|date=2015|title=A long-term follow-up of children and adolescents referred for assessment of auditory processing disorder.|url=|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=54|pages=368-375|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a 34-item questionnaire was developed that investigates auditory processing abilities in each of the six common areas of complaint in APD (listening and concentration, understanding speech, following spoken instructions, attention, and other.)  The final questionnaire was standardized on normally achieving young adults ranging from 18 to 27 years of age.  Validation data was acquired from subjects with language-learning or auditory processing disorders who were either self-reported or confirmed by diagnostic testing.  A UCAPI  total score is calculated by combining the totals from the six listening conditions and provides an overall value to categorize listening abilities. Additionally, analysis of the scores from the six listening conditions provides an auditory profile for the subject. Each listening condition can then be utilized by the professional in making recommendation for diagnosing problem of learning through listening and treatment decisions.  The UCAPI provides information on listening problems in various populations that can aid examiners in making recommendations for assessment and management.

==Diagnosis==
APD is a difficult disorder to detect and diagnose. The subjective symptoms that lead to an evaluation for APD include an intermittent inability to process verbal information, leading the person to guess to fill in the processing gaps. There may also be disproportionate problems with decoding speech in noisy environments.

APD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. | editors = Marilyn L Pinheiro and Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173–200 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is "what we do with what we hear",&lt;ref name='Katz 1992'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Katz | first1 = Jack  | title = Central auditory processing : a transdisciplinary view  | chapter = Classification of auditory processing disorders | editors = Jack Katz and Nancy Austin Stecker and Donald Henderson  | publisher = Mosby Year Book | year = 1992 | location = St. Louis | pages = 81–92 | isbn = 978-1-55664-372-9| oclc= 25877287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996.&lt;ref name=cap1996/&gt; This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.taracentar.hr/download/diagnosis_apd_school.pdf |format=pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt;

Auditory processing disorder can be developmental or acquired. It may result from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: "...[[sound localization]] and lateralization (see also [[binaural fusion]]); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and [[temporal masking]]; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including [[dichotic listening]]); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'&gt;{{cite web |title      = (Central) Auditory Processing Disorders.

The Committee of UK Medical Professionals Steering the UK Auditory Processing Disorder Research Program have developed the following working definition of Auditory Processing Disorder: "APD results from impaired neural function and is characterized by poor recognition, discrimination, separation, grouping, localization, or ordering of speech sounds. It does not solely result from a deficit in general attention, language or other cognitive processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebsa.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=29 |title= The British Society of Audiology and the UK APD Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of testing===
1. The SCAN-C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|date=2000|title=SCAN-C Test for Auditory Processing Dis- orders in Children|journal=Revised, Psychological Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children and SCAN-A&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keith|first=Robert|date=2009|title=SCAN-3:A Tests for Auditory Processing Disorders in Adolescents and Adults.|url=https://www.pearson.com/us/|journal=|publisher=Pearson US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adolescents and adults are the most common tool for screening and diagnosing APD in the USA.   Both tests are standardized on a large number of subjects and include validation data on subjects with auditory processing disorders.   The test batteries include screening tests: norm-based criterion-referenced scores; diagnostic tests: scaled scores, percentile ranks and ear advantage scores for all tests except the Gap Detection test.  The four tests include four subsets on which the subject scores are derived include: discrimination of monaurally presented single words against background noise (speech in noise), acoustically degraded single words (filtered words), dichotically presented single words and sentences. 

2. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) is also a standardized test. It assesses an individual’s gap detection threshold of tones and white noise. The exam includes stimuli at four different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) and white noise clicks of 50 ms duration. It is a useful test because it provides an index of auditory temporal resolution. In children, an overall gap detection threshold greater than 20 ms means they have failed and may have an auditory processing disorder based on abnormal perception of sound in the time domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muluk|first=Nuray Bayar|last2=Yalçınkaya|first2=Fulya|last3=Keith|first3=Robert W.|date=February 2011|title=Random gap detection test and random gap detection test-expanded: Results in children with previous language delay in early childhood|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0385814610001446|journal=Auris Nasus Larynx|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–13|doi=10.1016/j.anl.2010.05.007|issn=0385-8146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|title=Random gap detection test|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Gaps in Noise Test (GIN) also measures temporal resolution by testing the patient's gap detection threshold in white noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank E.|last2=Shinn|first2=Jennifer B.|last3=Jirsa|first3=Robert|last4=Bamiou|first4=Doris-Eva|last5=Baran|first5=Jane A.|last6=Zaida|first6=Elena|title=GIN (Gaps-In-Noise) Test Performance in Subjects with Confirmed Central Auditory Nervous System Involvement|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=December 2005|volume=26|issue=6|pages=608–618|doi=10.1097/01.aud.0000188069.80699.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Pitch Patterns Sequence Test (PPT) and Duration Patterns Sequence Test (DPT) measure auditory pattern identification. The PPS has s series of three tones presented at either of two pitches (high or low). Meanwhile, the DPS has a series of three tones that vary in duration rather than pitch (long or short). Patients are then asked to describe the pattern of pitches presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank|title=Frequency (Pitch) and Duration Pattern Tests|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=1994|page=265-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality-specificity and controversies===

The issue of modality-specificity has led to considerable debate among experts in this field.  Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should be defined as a ''modality-specific'' perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss.&lt;ref name='Cacace McFarland 1995'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Opening Pandora's Box: The Reliability of CAPD Tests | journal = American Journal of Audiology | date = July 1995 | first = Anthony T. | last = Cacace | author2 = Dennis J.

It is also impractical, as audiologists do not have access to standardized tests that are visual analogs of auditory tests. The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail auditory tests for reasons other than poor auditory processing. Although modality-specific testing has been advocated for well over a decade, to date no tests have been published which would allow audiologists to perform a modality-specific evaluation (i.e., no clinical versions of visual analogs to auditory processing tests exist).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Another controversy concerns the fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials.&lt;ref name="D.R.Moore (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David R.|year=2006|title=Auditory processing disorder (APD): Definition, diagnosis, neural basis, and intervention|journal=Audiological Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/16513860600568573}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-08-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The British Society of Audiology&lt;ref name='BSA2011'/&gt; has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of ''non-speech sounds''.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.

In recent years there have been additional criticisms of some popular tests for diagnosis of APD. Tests that use tape-recorded American English have been shown to over-identify APD in speakers of other forms of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The SCAN-C in testing for auditory processing disorder in a sample of British children.|first1=P|last1=Dawes |first2=D.V.

In a recent review of such diagnostic issues, it was recommended that children with suspected auditory processing impairments receive a holistic psychometric assessment including general intellectual ability, auditory memory, and attention, phonological processing, language, and literacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title= Controversies in central auditory processing disorder |veditors=Cacace AT, McFarland DJ |chapter= Putting the Auditory Processing Back into Auditory Processing Disorder in Children |vauthors=Cowan J, Rosen S, Moore DR |pages=187–197 |year=2009 |publisher= San Diego, Calif.; Abingdon: Plural. |isbn=978-159-756260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors state that "a clearer understanding of the relative contributions of perceptual and non-sensory, unimodal and supramodal factors to performance on psychoacoustic tests may well be the key to unravelling the clinical presentation of these individuals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Depending on how it is defined, APD may share common symptoms with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD/ADHD]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[autism spectrum]] disorders. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Connor K |title=Auditory processing in autism spectrum disorder: A review |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume= 36|issue= 2|pages= 836–54|date=December 2011 |pmid=22155284 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.11.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in audiology and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: "We regard it as crucial that these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research."&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawes P, Bishop D |title=Auditory processing disorder in relation to developmental disorders of language, communication and attention: a review and critique |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=440–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19925352 |doi=10.1080/13682820902929073 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, this seems rare.

To ensure that APD is correctly diagnosed, the examiners must differentiate APD from other disorders with similar symptoms. Factors that should be taken into account during the diagnosis are: attention, [[auditory neuropathy]], fatigue, hearing and sensitivity, intellectual and developmental age, medications, motivation, motor skills, native language and language experience, response strategies and decision-making style, and [[visual acuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerger|first1=James|last2=Musick|first2=Frank|title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=2000|volume=11|issue=9|pages=467–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that children under the age of seven cannot be evaluated correctly because their language and auditory processes are still developing. In addition, the presence of APD cannot be evaluated when a child's primary language is not English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandstaetter|first1=Patt|last2=Hunter|first2=Lisa|last3=Kalweit|first3=Linda|last4=Kloos|first4=Eric|last5=Landrud|first5=Sherry|last6=Larson|first6=Nancy|last7=Packer|first7=Amy|last8=Wall|first8=Deb|title=Introduction to Auditory Processing Disorders|journal=Minnesota Department of Education Total Special Education System|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* have trouble paying attention to and remembering information presented orally, and may cope better with visually acquired information
* have problems carrying out multi-step directions given orally; need to hear only one direction at a time
* have poor [[listening]] skills
* need more time to process information
* have low academic performance 
* have behavior problems
* have language difficulties (e.g., they confuse syllable sequences and have problems developing vocabulary and understanding language)
* have difficulty with reading, comprehension, spelling, and vocabulary

APD can manifest as problems determining the direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as "hat" with "bat", "there" with "where", etc.  Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. In addition, it is common for APD to cause speech errors involving the distortion and substitution of consonant sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVore|first1=Brooke|last2=Nagao|first2=Kyoko|last3=Pereira|first3=Olivia|last4=Nemith|first4=Julianne|last5=Sklar|first5=Rachele|last6=Deeves|first6=Emily|last7=Kish|first7=Emily|last8=Welsh|first8=Kelsey|last9=Morlet|first9=Thierry|title=Speech errors among children with auditory processing disorder|journal=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|date=2016|volume=29|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1121/2.0000440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word.  Background noise, such as the sound of a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson S, Kraus N |title=Sensory-cognitive interaction in the neural encoding of speech in noise: a review |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=575–85 |date=October 2010 |pmid=21241645 |pmc=3075209 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.21.9.3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt; Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.

As noted above, the status of APD as a distinct disorder has been queried, especially by speech-language pathologists&lt;ref name='Kamhi2011'&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.G.|last=Kamhi|year=2011|title= What speech-language pathologists need to know about Auditory Processing Disorder.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume= 42|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2010/10-0004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologists,&lt;ref name='Lovett2011'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=B.J.|year=2011|title=Auditory processing disorder: School psychologist beware?|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=48|pages=855–867|doi=10.1002/pits.20595}}&lt;/ref&gt; who note the overlap between clinical profiles of children diagnosed with APD and those with other forms of specific learning disability. Many audiologists, however, would dispute that APD is just an alternative label for dyslexia, SLI, or ADHD, noting that although it often co-occurs with these conditions, it can be found in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hearing Journal|year=

==Remediation and training==

{{See also|Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities}}

Treatment of APD typically focuses on three primary areas: changing learning environment, developing higher-order skills to compensate for the disorder, and remediation of the auditory deficit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellis|first1=Teri James|title=Auditory Processing Disorders (APD) in Children|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Understanding-Auditory-Processing-Disorders-in-Children/|website=www.asha.org|publisher=ASHA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a lack of well-conducted evaluations of intervention using [[randomized controlled trial]] methodology. Most evidence for effectiveness adopts weaker standards of evidence, such as showing that performance improves after training. This does not control for possible influences of practice, maturation, or placebo effects. Recent research has shown that practice with basic auditory processing tasks (i.e. auditory training) may improve performance on auditory processing measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Silva ME, Nye J, Hasbrouck J, Musiek FE |title=An update on professional education and clinical practices in central auditory processing |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=428–52; quiz 455 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17715652 |doi= 10.3766/jaaa.18.5.7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MooreDR2007 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory processing disorders: acquisition and treatment |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=295–304 |year=2007 |pmid=17467002 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and phonemic awareness measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore DR, Rosenberg JF, Coleman JS |title=Discrimination training of phonemic contrasts enhances phonological processing in mainstream school children |journal=Brain Lang |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=72–85 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15896385 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.11.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes after auditory training have also been recorded at the physiological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russo NM, Nicol TG, Zecker SG, Hayes EA, Kraus N |title=Auditory training improves neural timing in the human brainstem |journal=Behav.

Treating additional issues related to APD can result in success. For example, treatment for phonological disorders (difficulty in speech) can result in success in terms of both the phonological disorder as well as APD. In one study, speech therapy improved auditory [[evoked potential]]s (a measure of brain activity in the auditory portions of the brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leite RA, Wertzner HF, Matas CG |title=Long latency auditory evoked potentials in children with phonological disorder |journal=Pró-fono : Revista De Atualização Científica |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=561–6 |year=2010 |pmid=21271117 |doi= 10.1590/s0104-56872010000400034|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-56872010000400034&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is evidence that language training is effective for improving APD, there is no current research supporting the following APD treatments:
* [[Auditory Integration Training]] typically involves a child attending two 30-minute sessions per day for ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities|veditors=Jacobson JW, Foxx RM, Mulick JA |chapter= Auditory integration training: a critical review|vauthors=Mudford OC, Cullen C |pages=351–62|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-4192-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes (particularly, the Visualizing and Verbalizing program)
* Physical activities that require frequent crossing of the midline (e.g., [[occupational therapy]])
* Sound Field Amplification
* Neuro-Sensory Educational Therapy
*Neurofeedback

However, use of a FM transmitter has been shown to produce significant improvements over time with children.

==History==
The first research into APD began in 1954 with Helmer Myklebust's study, "Auditory Disorders in Children".&lt;ref&gt;Myklebust, H. (1954). Auditory disorders in children. New York: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; Myklebust's work suggested auditory processing disorder was separate from [[language]] learning difficulties. His work sparked interest in auditory deficits after acquired brain lesions affecting the temporal lobes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V |title=A new method for testing hearing in temporal lobe tumours; preliminary report |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=1954 |pmid=13197002 |doi= 10.3109/00016485409128700|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V, Migliavacca F |title=Testing "cortical" hearing in temporal lobe tumours |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |year=1955 |pmid=13275293 |doi= 10.3109/00016485509124282|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and led to additional work looking at the physiological basis of auditory processing,&lt;ref name="Kimura1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=Doreen|title=Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |

In 1977, the first conference on the topic of APD was organized by Robert W. Keith, Ph.D. at the University of Cincinnati.  The proceedings of that conference was published by Grune and Stratton under the title "Central Auditory Dysfunction" (Keith RW Ed.)  That conference started a new series of studies focusing on APD in children.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J., &amp; Illmer, R. (1972). Auditory perception in children with learning disabilities. In J. Katz (Ed.), Handbook of clinical audiology (pp. 540–563).

These early researchers also invented many of the auditory training approaches, including interhemispheric transfer training and interaural intensity difference training. This period gave us a rough understanding of the causes and possible treatment options for APD.
Much of the work in the late nineties and 2000s has been looking to refining testing, developing more sophisticated treatment options, and looking for genetic risk factors for APD. Scientists have worked on improving behavioral tests of auditory function, [[neuroimaging]], [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic]], and [[electrophysiologic]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Thibodeau L, Martin J |title=Behavioral and electrophysiologic evidence of auditory processing disorder: a twin study |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=438–60 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12371661 |doi= |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Estes RI, Jerger J, Jacobson G |title=Reversal of hemispheric asymmetry on auditory tasks in children who are poor listeners |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=59–71 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11895008 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with new technology has led to a number of software programs for auditory training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Musiek FE |title=Auditory training: Principles and approaches for remediation and managing auditory processing disorders |journal=Seminars in Hearing  |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=287–295  |year=2002 |ISSN=0734-0451 |pmid= |doi=10.1055/s-2002-35878 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Musiek F |title=Habilitation and management of auditory processing disorders: overview of selected procedures |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=329–42 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10385875 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With global awareness of mental disorders and increasing understanding of [[neuroscience]], auditory processing is more in the public and academic consciousness than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Task Force on Central Auditory Processing Consensus Development |title=Central auditory processing: Current status of research and implications for clinical practice  [Technical Report] |journal=American Journal of Audiology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=41–54 |year=1996 |doi=10.1044/policy.TR1996-00241 |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004220836/http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |format=pdf |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |access-date=2012-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621224822/http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keith, Robert W. |title=Central auditory and language disorders in children |publisher=College-Hill Press |location=San Diego, CA |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-933014-74-0 |oclc=9258682 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Henderson, Donald |author3=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing: a transdisciplinary view |publisher=Mosby Year Book |location=St. Louis, MO |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=1-55664-372-1 |oclc= 2587728 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing disorders: mostly management |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-205-27361-0 |oclc=246378171 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boeraans''' is a dialect of [[Afrikaans]] which is one of the 11 official languages in South Africa, and is one of the youngest Germanic languages with official status.

Boeraans was also known as "Die Taal" (meaning "The Language). The Border Boers moved from the Western Cape to the Eastern Cape, and stayed there.

In 1820, the Boers moved to the region known as the [[Free State Province]] in South Africa and Transvaal (now the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and a part of North West) in South Africa.

In terms of the [[3 × 3 writing process]], [[prewriting]] belongs to phase one of the writing process. Prewriting focuses on how to properly convey the information in a message by analyzing its purpose, anticipating the audience's reaction and adapting the content of the message to that audience. Examples of methods that may assist you in your pre-writing phase include: [[free-writing]], [[planning]], [[research]], [[Outline (list)|outlining]], [[storyboarding]] or [[:wikt:clustering|clustering]]. 

Business writing is different from other types of writing because it needs to be purposeful, economical and reader-oriented. It is important for business writers to focus on expressing their ideas rather than impressing the intended audience. The goal is to get the message across in a clear and simple manner. 

The 3 × 3 writing process is divided into three different phases. This chapter focuses on Phase 1 which involves analyzing, anticipating and adapting. Phase 2 requires research, organization and composition. Finally, Phase 3 includes revising, proofreading and evaluating. In the case of short messages, writing can be done relatively quickly by spending a small amount of time on each phase. However, for longer documents, it is better to spend a good amount of time working through each phase of the writing process. It is also possible to rearrange the steps in the process and even repeat some steps if necessary. The writing process is recursive rather than linear so the writer is free to revise the text at any point.  

Business writing often involves collaborating with others, such as when working in teams. Generally, team members get together in the beginning, during Phase 1, to exchange ideas. During Phase 2, each member can work separately to do some writing. Once that's done, members can meet again for Phase 3 to revise the document as a team.

==Analyze==
Analyzing, which is the first step of the prewriting process, focuses on both detecting the main goals of the business message and choosing the most effective way to express the information to the audience. Finding out the main goals of business writing requires considering and summarizing the needs of the audience, would all be conveyed by: [[email]], [[instant message]], [[business letters]], [[memos]], [[reports]], etc.  Only when the information presented through the writing matches the demands of the audience will it attract the audience's attention. Generally, most business writing can be devoted to informing and persuading the audience. However, it is just as necessary to establish a good relationship with the audience.
  
Choosing the most appropriate way of conveying information is fairly significant for improving efficiency of expression. Delivering a message in the proper way depends on a few factors. It is helpful to note the importance of the message, the feedback needed and the cost of the method of delivery.

==Anticipate==

Anticipating includes profiling the audience and learning to adjust the message according to its recipients. Profiling the audience helps the writer establish the proper tone and language of the message. It also helps with choosing the right method to deliver the message. Another benefit of profiling the audience is identifying the possibility of a secondary audience. More information might be needed if the message is also intended for a secondary audience.

==Adapt==

Adapting involves using certain techniques to tailor the message to the intended audience. When writing a message, it is essential to pay attention to the tone because it is a good indicator of how the reader will feel while reading the message. Words that are chosen improperly can contribute to an overall negative tone and can make the message sound unpleasant. Therefore, it is a good idea to choose words that will have a positive impact on the tone of the message. One technique involves putting the focus of the message on the receiver. This can be achieved by using second-person pronouns throughout the text and it shows that the writer has empathy towards the reader. Another technique involves using [[Bias-free communication|bias-free language]] which means the message should be free from gender, race, age and disability bias so as to not offend anyone. It is also recommended to use a professional yet friendly tone to make the writer sound professional and approachable at the same time. It is a good idea to use positive words and avoid words that have negative connotations. Finally, it is in the writer's best interest to be polite, use simple language and words that are precise.

It is the responsibility of the writer to use language that is ethical for the purpose of avoiding litigation. When writing messages about stocks or financial services, it is important to follow the laws that protect investors. Also, regarding safety information, it is essential to write warnings on dangerous products as clearly and succinctly as possible. Messages that are used in sales and marketing should not have any false or misleading information. The messages should not be written in a way that will deceive customers. The use of proper language is also helpful regarding employee evaluation. In letters of recommendation, it is best to use positive language and stick to information that is related to the job.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14023">In [[formal language theory]], a  '''context-free language''' ('''CFL''') is a [[formal language|language]] generated by a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG).

Context-free languages have many applications in [[programming languages]], in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.

==Background==

===Context-free grammar===

Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language.

===Automata===

The set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by [[pushdown automata]], which makes these languages amenable to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.

==Examples==

A model context-free language is &lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^n:n\geq1\}&lt;/math&gt;, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are {{mvar|a}}'s, and the entire second halves of which are {{mvar|b}}'s. {{mvar|L}} is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to aSb ~|~ ab&lt;/math&gt;.
This language is not [[regular language|regular]].
It is accepted by the [[pushdown automaton#Formal definition|pushdown automaton]] &lt;math&gt;M=(\{q_0,q_1,q_f\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,z\}, \delta, q_0, z, \{q_f\})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:&lt;ref group=note&gt;meaning of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;'s arguments and results: &lt;math&gt;\delta(\mathrm{state}_1, \mathrm{read}, \mathrm{pop}) = (\mathrm{state}_2, \mathrm{push})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\delta(q_0, a, z) &amp;= (q_0, az) \\
\delta(q_0, a, a) &amp;= (q_0, aa) \\
\delta(q_0, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, b, a) &amp;= (q_1, \varepsilon) \\
\delta(q_1, \varepsilon, z) &amp;= (q_f, \varepsilon)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Unambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are [[Inherently ambiguous language|inherently ambiguous]] CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^m c^m d^n | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^m d^m | n, m &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt;. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; which is the intersection of these two languages.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=100|loc=Theorem 4.7}}

===Dyck language===

The [[Dyck language|language of all properly matched parentheses]] is generated by the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\to SS ~|~ (S) ~|~ \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

===Context-free parsing===
{{main|Parsing}}

The context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.

Determining an instance of the [[membership problem]]; i.e. given a string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, determine whether &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the language generated by a given grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; is also known as ''recognition''. Context-free recognition for [[Chomsky normal form]] grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to boolean [[matrix multiplication]], thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of [[Big O notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.3728639&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=Leslie Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time|date=Jan 1974| pages=11| institution=Carnegie Mellon University| url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2751&amp;context=compsci}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Leslie G. Valiant| title=General context-free recognition in less than cubic time| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1975| volume=10| number=2| pages=308–315| doi=10.1016/s0022-0000(75)80046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In Valiant's papers, ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.81&lt;/sup&gt;) given, the then best known upper bound. See [[Matrix multiplication#Algorithms for efficient matrix multiplication]] and [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm]] for bound improvements since then.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, Lillian Lee has shown ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−ε&lt;/sup&gt;) boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3−3ε&lt;/sup&gt;) CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lillian Lee| title=Fast Context-Free Grammar Parsing Requires Fast Boolean Matrix Multiplication| journal=J ACM| year=2002| volume=49| number=1| pages=1–15| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/bmmcfl-jacm.pdf| doi=10.1145/505241.505242| arxiv=cs/0112018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the  structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called ''[[parsing]]''. Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed.

Formally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

A special subclass of context-free languages are the [[deterministic context-free language]]s which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] and can be parsed by a [[LR parser|LR(k) parser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D.

See also [[parsing expression grammar]] as an alternative approach to grammar and parser.

===Closure===
Context-free languages are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:
*the [[union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the reversal of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4d}}
*the [[concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \cdot P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.1}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under a [[String operations#String homomorphism|homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=131-132|loc=Corollary of Theorem 6.2}}
*the image &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(L)&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' under an [[String operations#String homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=132|loc=Theorem 6.3}}
*the [[circular shift#Applications|circular shift]] of ''L'' (the language &lt;math&gt;\{vu : uv \in L \}&lt;/math&gt;){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142-144|loc=Exercise 6.4c}}
*the prefix closure of ''L'' (the set of all [[Prefix (computer science)|prefix]]es of strings from ''L''){{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4b}}
*the [[Quotient of a formal language|quotient]] ''L''/''R'' of ''L'' by a regular language ''R''{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=142|loc=Exercise 6.4a}}

====Nonclosure under intersection, complement, and difference====
The context-free languages are not closed under intersection.  This can be seen by taking the languages &lt;math&gt;A = \{a^n b^n c^m \mid m, n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \{a^m b^n c^n \mid m,n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which are both context-free.&lt;ref group=note&gt;A context-free grammar for the language ''A'' is given by the following production rules, taking ''S'' as the start symbol: ''S'' → ''Sc'' | ''aTb'' | ''ε''; ''T'' → ''aTb'' | ''ε''. The grammar for ''B'' is analogous.&lt;/ref&gt; Their intersection is &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]. As a consequence, context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation, as for any languages ''A'' and ''B'', their intersection can be expressed by union and complement:  &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \overline{\overline{A} \cup \overline{B}} &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, context-free language cannot be closed under difference, since complement can be expressed by difference: &lt;math&gt;\overline{L} = \Sigma^* \setminus L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Scheinberg.1960"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82210847.pdf | author=Stephen Scheinberg | title=Note on the Boolean Properties of Context Free Languages | journal=Information and Control | volume=3 | number= | pages=372&amp;ndash;375 | month= | year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, if ''L'' is a context-free language and ''D'' is a regular language then both their intersection &lt;math&gt;L\cap D&lt;/math&gt; and their difference &lt;math&gt;L\setminus D&lt;/math&gt; are context-free languages.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Decidability===
In formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1138|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] for arbitrarily given [[context-free grammar]]s A and B:
*Equivalence: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=L(B)&lt;/math&gt;?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(1)}}
*Disjointness: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \cap L(B) = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=202|loc=Theorem 8.10}} However, the intersection of a context-free language and a ''regular'' language is context-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Salomaa|1973}}, p. 59, Theorem 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=135|loc=Theorem 6.5}} hence the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable (see "Emptiness" below).
*Containment: is &lt;math&gt;L(A) \subseteq L(B)&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(2)}} Again, the variant of the problem where ''B'' is a regular grammar is decidable,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while that where ''A'' is regular is generally not.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.12(4)}}
*Universality: is &lt;math&gt;L(A)=\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=203|loc=Theorem 8.11}}

The following problems are ''decidable'' for arbitrary context-free languages:
*Emptiness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; ?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(a)}}
*Finiteness: Given a context-free grammar ''A'', is &lt;math&gt;L(A)&lt;/math&gt; finite?{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=137|loc=Theorem 6.6(b)}}
*Membership: Given a context-free grammar ''G'', and  a word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, does &lt;math&gt;w \in L(G)&lt;/math&gt; ? Efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the membership problem are the [[CYK algorithm]] and [[Earley parser|Earley's Algorithm]].

According to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Rajeev Motwani |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=2003| publisher=Addison Wesley}} Here: Sect.7.6, p.304, and Sect.9.7, p.411&lt;/ref&gt; 
many of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yehoshua Bar-Hillel |author2=Micha Asher Perles |author3=Eli Shamir | title=On Formal Properties of Simple Phrase-Structure Grammars| journal=Zeitschrift für Phonetik, Sprachwissenschaft und Kommunikationsforschung| year=1961| volume=14| number=2| pages=143–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages that are not context-free===

The set &lt;math&gt;\{a^n b^n c^n d^n | n &gt; 0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-sensitive language]], but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language.{{sfn|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the [[pumping lemma for context-free languages]]&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel.Perles.Shamir.1961"/&gt; or a number of other methods, such as [[Ogden's lemma]] or [[Parikh's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/265/how-to-prove-that-a-language-is-not-context-free How to prove that a language is not context-free?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crossed letter''' is a [[manuscript]] [[letter (message)|letter]] which contains two separate sets of writing, one written over the other at right-angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~awoodley/crossedletter.html|title=A crossed letter|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0-8166-2795-9|location = |page = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done during the early days of the [[postal system]] in the 19th century to save on expensive postage charges, as well as to save paper.

A cross letter is distinct from a [[palimpsest]], as cross-hatched manuscripts were written this way at one sitting or for the same purpose (such as a diary), rather than being re-used later.

'''Cursive''' (also known as '''script''' or '''longhand''', among other names{{efn|Also known as '''handwriting''', '''looped writing''', '''joint writing''', '''joined-up writing''', or '''running writing'''}}) is any style of [[penmanship]] in which some characters are written joined together in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "[[Italic script|italic]]" or "connected".

The cursive method is used with a number of alphabets due to its improved writing speed and infrequent pen lifting. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.

== Descriptions ==
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a [[wikt:conjoin|conjoin]]ed and/or ''flowing'' manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from "printscript" using [[block letters]], in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive [[copybook (education)|copybook]]s join all letters: formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Latin script|Latin]], and [[Cyrillic (script)|Cyrillic]] alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In [[cursive Hebrew|Hebrew cursive]] and [[Roman cursive]], the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra there is a version of Cursive called [[Modi alphabet|'Modi']]

=== Subclasses ===

==== Ligature ====
Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters.  Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called "cursive" (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.

==== Looped ====
[[file:Looped cursive sample.jpg|thumb|alt=The first verse of "Good King Wenceslas" in cursive|Looped cursive as taught in Britain in mid-20th century]]
In ''looped cursive'' penmanship, some [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]s and [[descender]]s have loops which provide for joins.  This is generally what people refer to when they say "cursive".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Italic ====
''[[italic script|Cursive italic]]'' penmanship—derived from [[chancery cursive]]—uses non-looped joins or no joins. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518 |title=How Handwriting Boosts the Brain |first=Gwendolyn |last=Bounds |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term "italic" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with [[italic type]]d letters that slant forward. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.

== Origin ==
The origins of the cursive method are associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the [[quill]]. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. Steel [[dip pen]]s followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see [[Signature]]) was a factor also, as opposed to machine [[font]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Jean (1997). ''Writing: The Story of Alphabets and Scripts'', London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. ['[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cursive was also favored because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper.
The term ''cursive'' derives from the 18th century [[Italian language|Italian]] ''corsivo'' from [[Medieval Latin]] ''cursivus'', which literally means ''running''. This term in turn derives from [[Latin]] ''currere'' ("to run, hasten").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=cursive|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cursive|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(also known in Bengali as "professional writing"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter ([[Bengali alphabet#The matra|''matra'']]) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the [[Bengali script|standard Bengali alphabet]] as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting.

{{Main|Roman cursive}}
[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|right|Example of old Roman cursive]]
''Roman cursive'' is a form of handwriting (or a [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]]) used in [[ancient Rome]] and to some extent into the [[Middle Ages]]. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the [[Latin alphabet]], and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. New Roman, also called [[minuscule cursive]] or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; "a", "b", "d", and "e" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line.

{{Main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
[[File:Greek manuscript cursive 6th century.png|thumb|right|Ancient Greek cursive script, 6th century A.D.]]

The [[Greek alphabet]] has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on [[papyrus]]. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed.

== Western Europe ==
During the Middle Ages, the flowing, connected cursive script of the Arabic language inspired Western Christian scholars to develop similar cursive scripts for Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Eastern Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages &amp; Magickal Systems of the World (Key of It All) |author=Hulse, David Allen | publisher=Llewellyn Publications | year=2002 | isbn=978-1567184280 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWHjIxkvXYEC | page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scripts then became the basis for all of the Latin-based cursive scripts used in Europe.

[[File:letter.posted.in.1894.arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cursive in English letter from 1894]]
[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in ''secretary hand''&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131-3: By William Shakespeare, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) {{ISBN|0-944435-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cursive writing was used in English before the [[Norman conquest]]. [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] typically include a boundary clause written in [[Old English]] in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—[[secretary hand]]—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century.

Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]], though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French ''[[Ronde script (calligraphy)|ronde]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the [[British Empire]] in the 17th and 18th centuries as [[round hand]] by John Ayers and William Banson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whalley|first=Joyce Irene|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|year=1980|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-906223-64-4|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], it is notable that [[Thomas Jefferson]] joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. However, a few days later, [[Timothy Matlack]] professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, [[Abraham Lincoln]] drafted the [[Gettysburg Address]] in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today.

Note that not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word.

[[File:HandwritingOfOneJohnJay(NotTheFamousOne).jpg|thumb|right|Cursive handwriting from the 19th-century USA.]]
In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a "fair hand", meaning it looked good, and firms trained their clerks to write in exactly the same script.

In the early days{{when|date=June 2017}} of the [[post office]], letters were written in cursive&amp;nbsp;– and to fit more text on a single sheet, the text was continued in lines [[Crossed letter|crossing at 90 degrees from the original text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0816627959|location = |pages = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block letters were not suitable for this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Although women's handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men's, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by [[Paul Standard]] in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be: that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, a number of various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including [[Getty-Dubay]], and [[Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting]]. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are [[Spencerian script|Spencerian]], [[Palmer Method]], [[D'Nealian]], and Zaner-Bloser script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-punishing-to-pleasurable-how-cursive-writing-is-looping-back-into-our-hearts/2018/08/31/aa180b9c-aa06-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.88491996752d] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the [[ballpoint pen]], patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. With their design, it was guaranteed that the ink would not smudge, as it would with the earlier design of pen, and it no longer required the careful penmanship one would use with the older design of pen. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold for a cheap price, changing the way people wrote. Over time the emphasis of using the style of cursive to write slowly declined{{quantify|date=August 2017}}, only to be later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How The Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/ballpoint-pens-object-lesson-history-handwriting/402205/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Decline of Handwriting|last = Enstrom|first = E.A.|date = 1965|journal = The Elementary School Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century due to its perceived lack of necessity. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a "dying art". Many consider cursive too tedious to learn and believe that it is not a useful skill.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cursive handwriting is disappearing from public schools|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/cursive-handwriting-disappearing-from-public-schools/2013/04/04/215862e0-7d23-11e2-a044-676856536b40_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date = 2013-04-04|access-date = 2015-10-30|issn = 0190-8286|first = T.

On the 2006 [[SAT]], a United States post-secondary education entrance exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Handwriting Is on the Wall |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=11 October 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001475_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests due to exams written in hard to read handwriting receive less marks, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/22/exam-markers-complain-about-students-blue-ink-scribbles|title=Poor handwriting 'may hinder students' chances of exam success'|first=Richard|last=Adams|date=21 August 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schools debate: Is cursive writing worth teaching? |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date=23 January 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-01-23-cursive-handwriting_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 nationwide survey found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting to students. Only 12 percent of teachers reported having taken a course in how to teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Steve|author2=Harris, Karen R. |author3=Mason, Linda |author4=Fink-Chorzempa, Barbara |author5=Moran, Susan |author6=Saddler, Bruce |title=How do primary grade teachers teach handwriting?

In 2012, the American states of [[Indiana]] and [[Hawaii]] announced that their schools will no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach "keyboard proficiency". Since the nationwide proposal of the [[Common Core State Standards]] in 2009, which do not include instruction in cursive, the standards have been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011, all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.&lt;ref name="TIME Newsfeed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/06/typing-beats-scribbling-indiana-schools-can-stop-teaching-cursive/?iid=nfmostpopular |title=Typing Beats Scribbling: Indiana Schools Can Stop Teaching Cursive |first=Kayla  |last=Webley |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=6 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/hawaii-no-longer-requires_n_915402.html "Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools"].

==== Conservation efforts and cognitive benefits ====
Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Reasons Kids Should Still Learn Cursive Writing|url = http://time.com/2820780/five-reasons-kids-should-still-learn-cursive-writing/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Katy|last = Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of schools in the United States.

With the widespread use of computers, researchers set out to test the effectiveness of both mediums.

=== German ===
Up to the 19th century, [[Kurrent]] (also known as ''German cursive'') was used in German language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of Kurrent, [[Sütterlin]], was widely used in the period 1911-1941 until the Nazi Party banned it, and German speakers brought up with Sütterlin continued to use it well into the post-war period.

Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the {{ill|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|de|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (introduced in 1953), the {{ill|Schulausgangsschrift|de|Schulausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1968), and the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de|title=Grundschrift-Schreibschrift|work=grundschrift-schreibschrift.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union has proposed replacing all three with [[Grundschrift]], a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift|title=German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools|author=Helen Pidd|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russian Cursive Cyrillic.svg|thumb|right|The standard modern Russian Cyrillic cursive alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, used in school education.]]
{{main|Russian cursive}}
The ''Russian Cursive [[Cyrillic]]'' alphabet is used (instead of [[Russian alphabet|the block letters]]) when handwriting the modern [[Russian language]]. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the 1st grade how to write using this Russian script.

== Chinese ==
Cursive forms of [[Chinese written language|Chinese characters]] are used in calligraphy; "running script" is the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] form and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|"rough script"]] (mistakenly called "grass script" due to misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes ''within'' an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in [[hanzi]] and in the derived Japanese [[kanji]] characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

[[File:Essais     Titelblatt (1588).png|thumb|Essays of [[Michel de Montaigne]]]]
An '''essay''' is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own [[argument]] — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a [[term paper|paper]], an [[article (publishing)|article]], a [[pamphlet]], and a [[short story]]. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holman|first1=William|title=A Handbook to Literature|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=193|edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essays are commonly used as [[literary criticism]], political [[manifestos]], learned [[arguments]], observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all  modern essays  are written in [[prose]], but works in [[Poetry|verse]] have been dubbed essays (e.g., [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' and ''[[An Essay on Man]]''). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and [[Thomas Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' are counterexamples.

In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal [[education]]. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; [[admissions essay|admission essays]] are often used by [[university|universities]] in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.

The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A [[Essay#Film|film essay]] is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] covers a topic with a linked series of [[photographs]] that may have accompanying text or [[Photo caption|captions]].

==Definitions==
[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.]]
An essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm Gale – Free Resources – Glossary – DE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425123427/http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm |date=2010-04-25 }}. Gale.cengage.com. Retrieved March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. [[Aldous Huxley]], a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Collected Essays'', "Preface".&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything", and adds that "by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece". Furthermore, Huxley argues that "essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference". 
These three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:
* The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole "write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description".
* The objective, the factual, and the concrete particular: The essayists that write from this pole "do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists of setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data".
* The abstract-universal: In this pole "we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.
Huxley adds that the most satisfying essays "...make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist."

The word ''essay'' derives from the French infinitive ''essayer'', "to try" or "to attempt".  In English ''essay'' first meant "a trial" or "an attempt", and this is still an alternative meaning.  The Frenchman [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as "attempts" to put his thoughts into writing, and his essays grew out of his [[commonplacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |title=Book Use Book Theory: 1500–1700: Commonplace Thinking |publisher=Lib.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801200451/http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired in particular by the works of [[Plutarch]], a translation of whose ''Œuvres Morales'' (''Moral works'') into French had just been published by [[Jacques Amyot]], Montaigne began to compose his essays in 1572; the first edition, entitled ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', was published in two volumes in 1580.  For the rest of his life, he continued revising previously published essays and composing new ones. [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|essays]], published in book form in 1597, 1612, and 1625, were the first works in English that described themselves as ''essays''.  [[Ben Jonson]] first used the word ''essayist'' in English in 1609, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

==History==
{{globalize|date=January 2011}}

===Europe===
English essayists included [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] (1577–1641) and [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–1682). In France, [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s three volume ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay. In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] wrote about courtly manners in his essay ''Il Cortigiano''. In the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] wrote about the theme of wisdom.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay essay (literature) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204053246/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay |date=2009-12-04 }}. Britannica.com. Retrieved March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of [[periodical literature]], as seen in the works of [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English – [[William Hazlitt]], [[Charles Lamb]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]] all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects. In the 20th century, a number of essayists tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g., [[T.S. Eliot]]). Whereas some essayists used essays for strident political themes, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Willa Cather]] wrote lighter essays. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Edmund Wilson]], and [[Charles du Bos]] wrote literary criticism essays.&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt;

===Japan===
{{main article|Zuihitsu}}
As with the [[novel]], essays existed in Japan several centuries before they developed in Europe with a genre of essays known as ''zuihitsu'' — loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese literature are in this genre. Notable examples include ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' (c. 1000), by court lady [[Sei Shōnagon]], and ''[[Tsurezuregusa]]'' (1330), by particularly renowned Japanese Buddhist monk [[Yoshida Kenkō]]. Kenkō described his short writings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as "nonsensical thoughts" written in "idle hours". Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that women have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.

==Forms and styles==
This section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These forms and styles are used by an array of authors, including university students and professional [[List of essayists|essayists]].

===Cause and effect===
The defining features of a "cause and effect" essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], determine the [[Intention|purpose]], consider the [[audience]], think critically about different causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the [[language]], and decide on a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7: Cause and Effect in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification and division===
Classification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while division is the breaking of a larger whole into smaller parts.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Classification and Division in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compare and contrast===
Compare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6: Comparison and Contrast in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expository ===
Expository essay is used to inform, describe or explain a topic, using important facts and teaching reader about the topic. Mostly written in [[Third-person pronoun|third-person]], using "it", "he", "she", "they". Expository essay uses formal language to discuss someone or something. Examples of expository essays are: a medical or biological condition, social or technological process, life or character of a famous person. Writing of expository essay often consists of following next steps: organizing thoughts ([[brainstorming]]), researching a topic, developing a [[thesis statement]], writing the introduction, writing the body of essay, writing the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nova.edu/tutoring-testing/study-resources/forms/planning-an-expository-essay.pdf|title=Subject Verb Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=Nova Southeastern University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expository essays are often assigned as a part of SAT and other standardized testings or as a homework for high school and college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writeanypapers.com/blog/expository-essay-writing-steps/|title=How to Write a Good Expository Essay {{!}} WriteAnyPapers|last=|first=|date=17 Jun 2018|website=WriteAnyPapers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive===
Descriptive writing is characterized by [[sensory perception|sensory]] details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that appeal to a reader's emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also be [[chronological]] or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such as [[denotative]] language, [[connotative]] language, [[figurative language]], [[metaphor]], and [[simile]] to arrive at a dominant impression.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2: Description in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; One university essay guide states that "descriptive writing says what happened or what another author has discussed; it provides an account of the topic".&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.1 of the Simon Fraser University CNS Essay Handbook. Available online at: [https://www.sfu.ca/cns/PDF/CNS_Essay_Handbook.pdf sfu.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyric essay]]s are an important form of descriptive essays.

===Dialectic===
In the [[dialectic]] form of the essay, which is commonly used in [[philosophy]], the writer makes a thesis and argument, then objects to their own argument (with a counterargument), but then counters the counterargument with a final and novel argument. This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while countering a possible flaw that some may present. This type is sometimes called an ethics paper'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|title=How to Write an Ethics Paper (with Pictures) - wikiHow|accessdate=2016-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828152926/http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemplification===
An exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable examples including [[anecdote]]s. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification essay.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4: Exemplification in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Essay on the Principle of Population.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus']] ''[[Essay on the Principle of Population]]'']]

===Familiar===
An essayist writes a ''familiar essay'' if speaking to a single reader, writing about both themselves, and about particular subjects. [[Anne Fadiman]] notes that "the genre's heyday was the early nineteenth century," and that its greatest exponent was [[Charles Lamb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadiman|first=Anne|author-link=Anne Fadiman|title=At Large and At Small: Familiar Essays|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also suggests that while critical essays have more brain than the heart, and personal essays have more heart than brain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, ''At Large and At Small'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History (thesis)===
A history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument or claim about one or more historical events and supports that claim with evidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the reader why the argument or claim is as such.&lt;ref&gt;History Essay Format &amp; Thesis Statement, (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
A [[narrative]] uses tools such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[Flashforward|flash-forwards]], and [[Transition (fiction)|transitions]] that often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative. A narrative is usually arranged chronologically.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3 Narration in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argumentative===
An [[argumentative]] essay is a [[criticism|critical]]  piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective [[analysis]] of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure. Its structure normally builds around  introduction with a topic's relevance and a [[thesis statement]], body paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and conclusion. In addition, an argumentative essay may include a refutation section where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and criticized. Each [[argument]] of argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient evidence, relevant to the point.

=== Process ===
A process essay is used for an explanation of making or breaking something. Often, it is written in chronological order or numerical order to show step-by-step processes. It has all the qualities of a [[Technical documentation|technical document]] with the only difference is that it is often written in [[Linguistic description|descriptive mood]], while a technical document is mostly in [[imperative mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://literarydevices.net/process-essay/|title=Process Essay - Examples and Definition of Process Essay|date=2017-04-04|work=Literary Devices|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
An [[economic]] essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It can take a narrative course and a descriptive course. It can even become an [[argumentative]] essay if the author feels the need. After the introduction, the author has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to analyze it, evaluate it, and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a narrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of the economic puzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader

===Reflective===
A ''reflective essay'' is an [[analysis|analytical]] piece of writing in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, or form — adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in the author's life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn’t just describe the situation,  but revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional learning — and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author's life.

===Other logical structures===
The logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many forms. Understanding how the movement of thought is managed through an essay has a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to impress. A number of alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams, making them easy to implement or adapt in the construction of an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |title='Mission Possible' by Dr. Mario Petrucci |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026012057/http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumb|[[University student]]s, like these students doing research at a university library, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they have read.]] 
{{main article|Free response}}
In countries like the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], essays have become a major part of a formal [[education]] in the form of [[free response]] questions. Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (''see'' [[admissions essay]]). In both secondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university students must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.

In these countries, so-called academic essays also called ''papers'', are usually more formal than literary ones.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} They may still allow the presentation of the writer's own views, but this is done in a logical and factual manner, with the use of the [[first-person narrative|first person]] often discouraged. Longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} are often more discursive.  They sometimes begin with a short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic, which is often called a [[literature review]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Longer essays may also contain an introductory page that defines words and phrases of the essay's topic. Most academic institutions require that all substantial facts, quotations, and other supporting material in an essay be referenced in a [[bibliography]] or works cited page at the end of the text. This scholarly convention helps others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to understand the basis of facts and quotations the author uses to support the essay's argument and helps readers evaluate to what extent the argument is supported by evidence, and to evaluate the quality of that evidence. The academic essay tests the student's ability to present their thoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual capabilities.

One of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may submit essays purchased from an [[essay mill]] (or "paper mill") as their own work. An "essay mill" is a [[ghostwriting]] service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since [[plagiarism]] is a form of [[academic dishonesty]] or [[academic fraud]], universities and colleges may investigate papers they suspect are from an essay mill by using [[plagiarism detection]] software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khomami |first=Nadia |title=Plan to crack down on websites selling essays to students announced |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193720/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |archivedate=27 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine or newspaper==
{{main|Long-form journalism}}
Essays often appear in magazines, especially magazines with an intellectual bent, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]''. Magazine and newspaper essays use many of the essay types described in the section on forms and styles (e.g., descriptive essays, narrative essays, etc.). Some newspapers also print essays in the [[op-ed]] section.

==Employment==
Employment essays detailing experience in a certain occupational field are required when applying for some jobs, especially government jobs in the United States. Essays known as Knowledge Skills and Executive Core Qualifications are required when applying to certain US federal government positions.

A KSA, or "Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities," is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to Federal government job openings in the United States. KSAs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for.

An Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is required when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US Federal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core qualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive Service must demonstrate.

===Film===
A film essay (or "cinematic essay") consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} From another perspective, an essay film could be defined as a [[documentary film]] visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends [[Documentary film|documentary]], [[fiction]], and [[Experimental film|experimental film making]] using tones and editing styles.&lt;ref name="chicagomediaworks1"&gt;[http://www.chicagomediaworks.com/2instructworks/3editing_doc/3editing_docinematicessay.html Cinematic Essay Film Genre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808123129/http://www.chicagomediaworks.com/2instructworks/3editing_doc/3editing_docinematicessay.html |date=2007-08-08 }}. chicagomediaworks.com.

David Winks Gray's article "The essay film in action" states that the "essay film became an identifiable form of filmmaking in the 1950s and '60s". He states that since that time, essay films have tended to be "on the margins" of the filmmaking the world. Essay films have a "peculiar searching, questioning tone ... between documentary and fiction" but without "fitting comfortably" into either genre. Gray notes that just like written essays, essay films "tend to marry the personal voice of a guiding narrator (often the director) with a wide swath of other voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=David Winks|title=The essay film in action|url=http://www.sf360.org/features/the-essay-film-in-action|publisher=[[San Francisco Film Society]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315200322/http://www.sf360.org/features/the-essay-film-in-action|archivedate=March 15, 2009|date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Wisconsin]] Cinematheque website echoes some of Gray's comments; it calls a film essay an "intimate and allusive" genre that "catches filmmakers in a pensive mood, ruminating on the margins between fiction and documentary" in a manner that is "refreshingly inventive, playful, and idiosyncratic".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720113611/http://cinema.wisc.edu/series/2009_spring/essay.htm "Talking Pictures: The Art of the Essay Film"].

===Music===
In the realm of [[music]], composer [[Samuel Barber]] wrote a set of "Essays for Orchestra," relying on the form and content of the music to guide the listener's ear, rather than any [[program music|extra-musical plot or story]].

===Photography===
[[File:Huahine, French Polynesia, Image - Scott Williams.jpg|thumb|"After School Play Interrupted by the Catch and Release of a Stingray" is a simple time-sequence [[photo essay]].]]

A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] strives to cover a topic with a linked series of [[photograph]]s. Photo essays range from purely photographic works to photographs with captions or small notes to full-text essays with a few or many accompanying photographs. Photo essays can be sequential in nature, intended to be viewed in a particular order — or they may consist of non-ordered photographs viewed all at once or in an order that the viewer chooses. All photo essays are collections of photographs, but not all collections of photographs are photo essays. Photo essays often address a certain issue or attempt to capture the character of places and events.

===Visual arts===
In the visual [[art]]s, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work's composition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes from the word ''essay'''s meaning of "attempt" or "trial").

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.

In [[philosophy of language]], a context in which a sub-sentential expression ''e'' appears is called extensional if and only if ''e'' can be replaced by an expression with the same extension and necessarily preserve [[truth-value]].  The [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of a term is the set of objects that that term denotes.

Take the case of [[Clark Kent]], who is secretly [[Superman]].  Suppose that [[Lois Lane]] fell out of a window and Superman caught her.  Thus the statement, "Clark Kent caught Lois Lane," is true because it has an '''extensional context'''.  The names "Superman" and "Clark Kent" have the same extension, which is to say that they both refer to the same person, i.e., that superhero who is vulnerable to [[kryptonite]].  Anybody that Superman caught, Clark Kent caught.

In opposition to extensional contexts are intensional contexts, where synonymous terms cannot be substituted in without potentially compromising the truth-value. Suppose that Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent will investigate a news story with her.  The statement, "Lois Lane believes that Superman will investigate a news story with her," is false, even though Superman is Clark Kent.  This is because 'believes' is typically an intensional context.

'''Folk etymology''' or '''reanalysis''' – sometimes called '''pseudo-etymology''', '''popular etymology''', or '''analogical reformation''' – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |folk-etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|title=Language History: An introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXlAYlCSoZQC|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-8546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or [[morpheme]]s. [[Rebracketing]] is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or "bracketed" into a new set of supposed elements. [[Back-formation]], creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.

The term ''folk etymology'' is a [[loan translation]] from [[German language|German]] '''''Volksetymologie''''', coined by  [[Ernst Förstemann]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Förstemann|first=Ernst|editor=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1852|publisher=F. Dümmler.|chapter=Ueber Deutsche volksetymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process in [[historical linguistics]], [[language change]], and [[social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/ENGINEERING.pdf ''''Etymythological''' Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] in ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'' (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi &amp; [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to [[loanword]]s or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form [[wikt:sparrowgrass|''sparrowgrass'']], originally from Greek {{lang|el|ἀσπάραγος}} ("[[asparagus]]") remade by analogy to the more familiar words ''sparrow'' and ''grass'',&lt;ref name="Anttila1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anttila|first=Raimo|title=Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C25_9m7U-AC|year=1989|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-3556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word ''[[hamburger|burger]]'', originally from ''[[Hamburg]]'' + ''-er'' ("thing connected with"), but understood as ''ham'' + ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=Shaligram|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|editor=R.

== Productive force ==
The technical term "folk etymology" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Volksetymologie'', coined by [[Ernst Förstemann]]. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in [[philology]], there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"/&gt; Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying [[sound changes]], the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Etymology|volume=9|pages=864-865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin.  This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include ''[[crayfish]]'' or ''crawfish'', which are not historically related to ''fish'' but come from [[Middle English]] ''crevis'', [[cognate]] with French ''écrevisse''. Likewise ''chaise lounge'', from the original French ''chaise longue'' ("long chair"), has come to be associated with the word ''lounge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyles |first1=Thomas |last2=Algeo |first2=John |title=The Origins and Development of the English Language |edition=4th |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0030970547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Rebracketing|Back-formation}}
[[Rebracketing]] is a process of [[language change]] in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *''ham'' in ''hamburger'') are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ''[[ham]]''). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the [[Old French]] word ''orenge'' ("orange tree") comes from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|النرنج }} ''an nāranj'' ("the orange tree"), with the initial ''n'' of ''nāranj'' understood as part of the [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[back-formation]] a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be [[affix]]es. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pronuncia'' ("pronunciation; accent") is derived from the verb ''pronunciare'' ("to pronounce; to utter") and English ''edit'' derives from ''editor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.&lt;ref name="Shukla" /&gt;

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation.  Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, ''[[Wikt:andiron|andiron]]'' borrowed from Old French was variously spelled ''aundyre'' or ''aundiren'' in Middle English, but was altered by association with ''iron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|andiron, n.|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include ''[[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]'' (from ''berfrei'') by association with ''bell'', ''female'' (from ''femelle'') by ''male'', and ''penthouse'' (from ''apentis'') by ''house''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The variant spelling of ''licorice'' as ''[[wikt:liquorice|liquorice]]'' comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology |last=Barnhart |first=Robert K. |editor-link=[[Robert Barnhart]] |year=1988 |publisher=H.W. Wilson |isbn=978-0-8242-0745-8|page=593|quote=The development of Late Latin ''liquiritia'' was in part influenced by Latin ''liquēre'' 'to flow', in reference to the process of treating the root to obtain its extract.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Norman ''licoris'' (influenced by ''licor'' "liquor") and [[Late Latin]] ''liquirītia'' were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ''{{lang|he|γλυκύρριζα}}'' (glycyrrhiza) "sweet root".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1|liquorice licorice, n.|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word ''cockroach'', for example, was borrowed from Spanish ''cucaracha'' but was assimilated to the existing English words ''cock'' and ''[[Common Roach|roach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|cockroach, n.|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem artichoke]]'', from Italian ''girasole'', is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to [[artichoke]]s and does not come from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Artichoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''forlorn hope'' originally meant "storming party, body of skirmishers"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', vol. 1, A–M. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch ''verloren hoop'' "lost troop". But confusion with English ''hope'' has given the term an additional meaning of "hopeless venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|forlorn hope, n.|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the ''[[serviceberry]]'', ''service tree'', and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name ''[[sorbus]]''. The plants were called ''syrfe'' in Old English, which eventually became ''service''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|serve, n1|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8594-2|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of ''[[Welsh rarebit]]'', a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it ''Welsh rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=John|title=The Private Journal and Literary Remains of John Byrom|year=1854|publisher=Chetham society|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 [[Francis Grose]] suggested in ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' that the dish is "a Welch rare bit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grose|first=Francis|title=A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|year=1785|publisher=S. Hooper|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word ''rarebit'' was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=952|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some [[compound word]]s from [[Old English]] were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include ''[[wikt:bridegroom|bridegroom]]'' from Old English ''[[wikt:brydguma|brydguma]]'' "bride-man". The word ''[[wikt:gome|gome]]'' "man" from Old English ''[[wikt:guma|guma]]'' fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word ''[[wikt:groom|groom]]'' "male servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Groom}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar reanalysis caused ''[[wikt:sandblind|sandblind]]'', from Old English ''sāmblind'' "half-blind" with a once-common prefix ''sām-'' "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to ''sand''. The word ''island'' derives from Old English ''igland''. The modern spelling with the letter ''s'' is the result of comparison with the synonym ''[[wikt:isle|isle]]'' from Old French and ultimately Latin ''insula'', though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|title=A Dictionary of English Etymology: E - P|year=1862|publisher=Trübner|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the spelling of ''[[wikt:wormwood|wormwood]]'' was likely affected by comparison with ''wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|wormwood|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smythe Palmer|first=Abram|title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy|year=1882|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}

The phrase ''[[wikt:curry favor|curry favour]]'', meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English ''curry favel'', "[[horse grooming|groom]] a [[chestnut horse]]". This was an [[allusion]] to a fourteenth century French morality poem, ''Roman de Fauvel'', about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to ''favour'' as early as 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|year=2017|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: 'Curry favour'|work=Phrase Finder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/curry-favour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word ''[[wikt:shamefaced|shamefaced]]'' was originally ''[[wikt:shamefast|shamefast]]''. The original meaning of ''fast'' "fixed in place" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as ''stuck fast'', ''hold fast'', and ''[[wikt:play fast and loose|play fast and loose]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The songbird ''[[wheatear]]'' or ''white-ear'' is a back-formation from Middle English ''whit-ers'' "white arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=White-ear|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%E2%80%93ear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both ''white'' and ''arse'' are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wheatear |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wheatear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of ''[[hangnail]]'' referred to a [[Corn (medicine)|corn]] on the foot.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hangnail|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangnail |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from Old English ''[[wikt:ang-|ang-]]'' + ''[[wikt:nægel|nægel]]'' ("anguished nail" or "compressed spike"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hangnail|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn [[cuticle]] near a [[fingernail]] or toenail.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail" /&gt;

== Other languages ==

Several words in [[Medieval Latin]] were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word ''widerdonum'' meaning "reward" was borrowed from [[Old High German]] ''widarlōn'' "repayment of a loan". The ''l{{nbsp}}→{{nbsp}}d'' alteration is due to confusion with Latin ''donum'' "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |guerdon|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Similarly, the word ''baceler'' or ''bacheler'' (related to modern English [[Bachelor#Etymology and historical meanings|''bachelor'']]) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor.  This was later re-spelled ''baccalaureus'', probably reflecting a false derivation from ''bacca laurea'' "laurel berry", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brachet|first=Auguste|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language: Crowned by the French Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb ''savoir'' ("to know") as ''sçavoir'' on the false belief it was derived from Latin ''scire'' "to know".  In fact it comes from ''sapere'' "to be wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=David|title=Language and the Lexicon: An Introduction|year=2016|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83594-3|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian word ''liocorno'' "unicorn" derives from 13th century ''lunicorno'' (''lo'' "the" + ''unicorno'' "unicorn"). Folk etymology based on ''lione'' "lion" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal ''liofante'' "elephant" was likewise altered from ''elefante'' by association with ''lione''.&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|486}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[hammock]]" is ''hangmat''. It was borrowed from Spanish ''hamaca'' (ultimately from [[Arawak language|Arawak]] ''amàca'') and altered by comparison with ''hangen'' and ''mat'', "hanging mat". German ''Hängematte'' shares this folk etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hängematte|work=Wörterbuch Deutsch|url=http://en.worterbuchdeutsch.com/de/hangematte |date=October 2016|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] compound word for "jealous" ''mustasukkainen'' literally means "black-socked" (''musta'' "black" and ''sukka'' "sock"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish ''svartsjuk'' "black-sick". The Finnish word ''sukka'' fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish ''sjuk''

''[[Names of Istanbul#Islambol|Islambol]]'', a folk etymology meaning "full of Islam", is one of the names of [[Istanbul]] used after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t51PAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Kültür Bakanlığı|language=tr|isbn=978-975-7306-04-7|pages=253–255|chapter=İstanbul'un adları}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|type=Turkish-language|date=February 2017}}

An example from [[Persian language|Persian]] is the word [[shatranj]] (chess), which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[chaturanga]] (2nd century BCE), and after losing the "u" to [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], becomes ''chatrang'' in [[Middle Persian]] (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as ''shat'' (hundred) + ''ranj'' (worry / mood), or "a hundred worries".{{citation needed|reason=is this analysis the reason for the segmental change, or is that just passage through Arabic?|date=October 2015}}

== Background ==
The word '''embolalia''' comes from the Greek word ''embolos'' which means 'something thrown in', from the word ''emballo-'' meaning 'to throw in',&lt;ref name="Etymology of embolia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?embolalia|title=embolalia - Definition|first=|last=mondofacto|website=www.mondofacto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''-lalia'' meaning 'speech, chattering and babbling; abnormal or disordered form of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordinfo.info/unit/1140|title=lalo-, lallo-, lalio-, lal-, -lalia, -lalic + - Word Information|website=wordinfo.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern linguists led by [[Leonard Bloomfield]] in 1933 call these "hesitation forms", the sounds of stammering (uh), stuttering (um, um), throat-clearing (ahem!), stalling (well, um, that is), interjected when the speaker is groping for words or at a loss for the next thought.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|last=Safire|first=William|title=On Language; Impregnating the Pause|work=The New York Times|page=8|date=16 June 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/16/magazine/on-language-impregnating-the-pause.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French psychiatrist [[Jules Séglas]], on the other hand, referred to the term embolalia, as "the regular addition of prefixes or suffixes to words" and mentioned that the behavior is sometimes used by normal individuals to demonstrate to their interlocutor that they are paying attention to the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Harry Levin and Irene Silverman called formulaic language ''"vocal segregates"'' in their 1965 paper on '''hesitation phenomena''' and found out from their experiments on children that these segregates seem to be less voluntary hesitation phenomena and may be signs of uncontrolled emotionality under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Characteristics ==

===Linguistic features===

====Definition of formulaic sequences====

According to ''The Canadian Modern Language Review'', formulaic sequences are "fixed combinations of [[word]]s that ... can facilitate [[fluency]] in speech by making pauses shorter and less frequent, and allowing longer runs of speech between pauses".&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_modern_language_review/v063/63.1wood.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A formulaic sequence is "a sequence, continuous or discontinuous, of words or other elements, which is, or appears to be, prefabricated: that is, stored and retrieved whole from memory at the time of use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wray|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Wray|title=Formulaic Language and the Lexicon|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521022126|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be found everywhere in language use and "make up a large proportion of any discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt (Ed.)|first=Norbert|title=Formulaic Sequences in Action: An Introduction. In: Schmitt, Norbert (Ed.) Formulaic Sequences: Acquisition, Processing and Use|year=2004|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulaic sequences can be of any length and can be used to express messages, functions, social solidarity and process information very fast without communication misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt (Ed.)|first=Norbert|title=Formulaic Sequences in Action: An Introduction. In: Schmitt, Norbert (Ed.) Formulaic Sequences: Acquisition, Processing and Use|year=2004|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morphology and phonology====

''Filled pauses''

Filled pauses consist of repetitions of syllables and words, reformulation or false starts where speakers rephrase their speech to fit the representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for the right words in one's lexicon to carry across an intended meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freed|first=B.|title=Second Language Acquisition in a Study Abroad Context|year=1995|publisher=Amsterdam /Philadelphia: John Benjamins  Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur.&lt;ref name=Moniz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moniz|first=H. |author2=Mata, A. I. |author3=Viana, M. C.|title=On Filled Pauses and Prolongations in European Portuguese.|journal=Interspeech|year=2007|pages=2645–2648|url=http://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/4060.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a schwa-like quality [ə:], appears to be the most commonly used, some speakers consistently using the neutral vowel [ɨ:] instead, and others use both vowels in the same sentence, depending on the quality of the previous word last vowel.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Filled pauses vocalizations may be built around central vowels and speakers may differ in their preferences, but that they do not appear to behave as other words in the language.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; The lengthening of words ending in a coronal fricative, for instance, could be obtained by prolonging the entire rhyme and/or the fricative only.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Most of the time, however, the neutral vowel [ɨ:] is appended to achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

''Prolonged pauses''

Similarly to filled pauses, single occurrences of prolonged pauses occurring between stretches of fluent speech, may be preceded and followed by silent pauses, as they most often occur on function words with a CV or V structure.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; Even though they are not always central, the vowels of such syllables may be as long as the ones observed for filled pauses.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

''Retraced and unretraced restarts''

Riggenbach's 1991 study of fluency development in Chinese learners of English had an analysis of repair phenomena, which included retraced restarts and unretraced restarts.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach&gt;Riggenbach, H. (1991). Towards an understanding of fluency: A microanalysis of nonnative speaker conversations. Discourse Processes, 14: 423–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Retraced restarts refer to the reformulations whereby a portion of the original utterance is duplicated.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; They can either involve repetition, that is, the precise adjacent duplication of a sound, syllable, word or phrase, or insertion, which refers to a retraced restart with the addition of new unretraced lexical items.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; Conversely, unretraced restarts refer to reformulations that reject the original utterance, similarly known as false starts.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt;

====Semantics and pragmatics====
The semantics of formulaic language have often been debated on, and to date, there lacks a consensus on whether or not [[filler words]] are intentional in speech and whether or not they should be considered as words or if they are simply side effects of difficulties in the planning process of speech by speakers. Bailey &amp; Ferriera's (2007) paper&lt;ref name=bailey&gt;{{Citation

Filler words consist of "Non-lexical fillers" and "Lexical fillers".&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; "Non-lexical fillers" are recognized as fillers that are not words and "Lexical fillers" are recognized as fillers that are words and both types of fillers are thought to contain little or no semantic information.&lt;ref name=Riggenbach /&gt; However, some filler words are used to express certain speech acts. "Yeah", a "Lexical filler", is used to give affirmation, introduce a new topic, shows speaker's perception and understanding, and occurs after a speech management problem when the speakers does not how to continue their speech.&lt;ref name=fischer&gt;{{Citation

Research has shown that people were less likely to use formulaic language in general topics and domains they were more well-versed in, because they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S. |author2=F.

====Syntax====
Formulaic language is more likely to occur at the beginning of utterance or phrase and the reason is because it is presumed that there is a greater demand on planning processes at these junctures.&lt;ref name=schnadt&gt;Schnadt, M. J., and M. Corley. submitted. Buying time in spontaneous speech: How speakers accommodate lexical difficulty.&lt;/ref&gt; Features of formulaic language, like filled pauses or repetitions, are most likely to occur immediately prior to the onset of a complex syntactic constituent.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=H. H.|author2=Wasow, T.|title=Repeating words in spontaneous speech.|journal=Cognitive Psychology |year=1998|pages=201–242|url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~herb/1990s/Clark.Wasow.98.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1006/cogp.1998.0693|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filled pauses are also likely after the initial word in a complex constituent, especially after function words.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; Therefore, listeners might be able to use the presence of a recent filled pause to predict that an ambiguous structure, and this trait is in favor of a more complex analysis .&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

There are several different types of formulaic language. One type is relatively universal, often transcending differences in language and to some degree culture. Simple fillers like "Uhm", "Uh", or "Er" are used by many different people in many different settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com.ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg/public/tocnode?query=embolalia&amp;widen=1&amp;result_number=1&amp;from=search&amp;id=g9781405135221_chunk_g978140513522113&amp;type=fuzzy&amp;fuzzy=0&amp;slop=1|title=Blackwell Reference Online - Formulaic Sequences and Language Disorders.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, these types of fillers are considered innocuous, and are often overlooked by listeners, as long as they are not utilized so often that they overshadow the remainder of the conversation.&lt;ref name=Kuniper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuniper|first=K.|title=On the Linguistic Properties of Formulaic Speech.|journal=Oral Tradition |year=2000|pages=279–305|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/15ii/6_kuiper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of formulaic language are ingrained within specific cultures, and in fact are sometimes considered an identifying characteristic of people who share a particular religion, or live in a specific geographical region.&lt;ref name=Kuniper /&gt; Along with accents, formulaic language of this type is sometimes considered colorful and somewhat entertaining. Writers often make use of this type of speech to give the characters in their writings additional personality, helping to make them unique.&lt;ref name=wisegeek /&gt;

''Fluency''

The study conducted by Dechert (1980) that investigated the speech performance of a German student of English revealed that there is a tendency for speech pauses to be situated at breaks that are consistent with "episodic units".&lt;ref name=Dechert&gt;[Dechert, HW. (1980). Pauses and intonation as indicators of verbal planning in second-language speech productions: Two examples from a case study. In Dechert, HW &amp; Raupach, M. (Eds.), Temporal variables in speech (pp. 271-285).]&lt;/ref&gt; Dechert (1980) found that the more fluent utterances exhibited more pauses at those junctures and lesser within the "episodic units", leading him to posit that the study subject was able to use the narrative structure to pace his own speech with natural breaks in order for him to scout for the words and phrases that are to follow subsequently.&lt;ref name=Dechert /&gt;

Through the comparison of the story retelling utterances collated of second language learners, Lennon (1984) discovered notable disparities in the distribution of pauses between recounting  in the research subjects' first and second languages respectively.&lt;ref name=Lennon&gt;[Lennon, P. (1984). Retelling a story in English. In HW, Dechert, D. Mehle, 8c M. Raupauch (Eds.), Second Language Productions (pp. 50-68). Turbingen: Gunter Narr Verlag.]&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that all of the pauses were found to be located either at clause breaks or following nonintegral components of the clause, without pauses within the clauses.&lt;ref name=Lennon /&gt; On the other hand, the narrators who spoke using their second language exhibited different patterns, with a higher frequency of pauses occurring within the clauses, leading to the conclusion posited by Lennon to be that the speakers seem to be "planning within clauses as well as in suprasegmental units", and hence, the occurrence of pauses within clauses and not at the intersection of clauses could well be an indicator distinguishing fluent and confluent speech.&lt;ref name=Lennon /&gt;

===Discourse features===

====Cognitive load====
[[Cognitive load]] is an important predictor of formulaic language.&lt;ref name=corley /&gt; More [[Speech disfluency|disfluency]] is found in longer utterances&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Speech rate====
Formulaic phrases are uttered more quickly than comparable non-formulaic phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexicallab.com/2015/02/words-are-difficult-to-define/|title=2  Words are difficult to define|work=Lexical Lab|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech rate is closely related to cognitive load.&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{Citation

In fast conditions, cognitive processes that result in a phonetic plan, fail to keep up with articulation, and thus, the articulation of the existing plan is restarted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Frequency of words====
In Beattie and Butterworth's (1979) study, low frequency content words and those rated as contextually improbable were preceded by hesitations such as fillers.&lt;ref name=beattie&gt;{{Citation

====Domain (addressor vs. addressee)====
Humans are found to be more disfluent overall when addressing other humans as compared to when addressing machines.&lt;ref name=oviatt /&gt; More instances of formulaic language is found in dialogues than in monologues.&lt;ref name=oviatt&gt;{{Citation

==Functions==

===Comprehension cues===

There is a common agreement that [[disfluencies]] are accompanied by important modifications both at the segmental and prosodic levels and that speakers and listeners use such cues systematically and meaningfully. Thus they appear as linguistic universal devices that are similar to other devices and are controlled by the speaker and regulated by language specific constraints.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt; In addition, speech disfluencies such as fillers can help listeners to identify upcoming words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While formulaic language can serve as a useful cue that more is to come, some people do develop an unconscious dependence on these filler words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As the individual gains confidence and is less apt to have a need for filler words, the predilection toward formulaic language is then able to gradually diminish.&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-automatic-speech.htm|title=What is Automatic Speech?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by Foxtree (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox Tree | first1 = J. E. | year = 2001 | title = Listeners' uses of um and uh in speech comprehension | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 320–326 | doi=10.3758/bf03194926}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that both English and Dutch listeners were faster to identify words in a carrier sentence when it was preceded with an "Uh" instead of without an "Uh", which suggested that different fillers have different effects as they might be conveying different information.&lt;ref name=corley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corley|first=M.|author2=Stewart, O. W.|title=Hesitation Disfluencies in Spontaneous Speech: The Meaning of ''um''.|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|year=2008|pages=589–602|url=http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/martinc/offprints/cs_llc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer and Brandt-Pook also found out that discourse particles mark thematic breaks, signal the relatedness between the preceding and following utterance, indicate if the speaker has understood the content communicated, and support the formulation process by signalling possible problems in speech management.&lt;ref name=fischer /&gt;

While fillers might give listeners cues about the information being conveyed, Bailey &amp; Ferreira's study&lt;ref name=Disfluencies&gt;{{Citation

A "Good Cue" leads the listener to correctly predict the onset of a new constituent (Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase), whereas a "Bad Cue" leads the listener to incorrectly predict the onset of a new constituent.&lt;ref name=Disfluencies /&gt; "Good Cue" make it easier for listeners to process the information they have been presented while "Bad Cue" make it harder for listeners process the relevant information.&lt;ref name=Disfluencies /&gt;

There is strong empirical evidence that speakers use formulaic language in similar ways across languages and that formulaic language plays a fundamental role in the structuring of spontaneous speech, as they are used to achieve a better synchronization between interlocutors by announcing upcoming topic changes, delays related to planning load or preparedness problems, as well as speaker's intentions to take/give the floor or to revise/abandon an expression he/she had already presented.&lt;ref name=Moniz /&gt;

===Communicative goals===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that parts of formulaic language, such as fillers, serve a communicative function and are considered integral to the information the speaker tries to convey, although they do not add to the propositional content or the primary message.&lt;ref name=foxtree /&gt; Instead, they are considered part of a collateral message where the speaker is commenting on her performance.&lt;ref name=foxtree /&gt; Speakers produce filled pauses (e.g. "Uh" or "Um") for a variety of reasons, including the intention to discourage interruptions or to gain additional time to plan utterances.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;

Another communicative goal includes the attention-impelling function,&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; which explores another purpose of hesitation forms as being to dissociate oneself slightly from the harsh reality of what is to follow.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt; With the use of a beat of time filled with a meaningless interjection, uncommitted people who are "into distancing" make use of such formulaic language to create a little distance between themselves and their words, as if it might lessen the impact of their words.&lt;ref name="Safire" /&gt;

However, not all forms of formulaic language are considered appropriate or harmless.There are examples of formulaic language production that lean towards being offensive, for instance, the use of anything considered to be [[profanity]] within a given culture.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt;

In this form, the speech is usually the insertion of [[swear words]] within the sentence structure used to convey various ideas. At times, this use of formulaic language comes about due to the individual being greatly distressed or angry.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt; However, there are situations where swear words are inserted unconsciously even if the individual is extremely happy.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt; When the use of swear words is called to the attention of the individual, he or she may not even have been aware of the usage of such formulaic language.&lt;ref name="wisegeek"/&gt;

==Neurological basis==

===Medical cases===

====Aphasia====
{{Main article|Aphasia}}
Many patients who suffer from [[aphasia]] retain the ability to produce formulaic language, including conversational speech formulas and swear words—in some cases, patients are unable to create words or sentences, but they are able to swear. Also, the ability to pronounce other words can change and evolve during the process of recovery, while pronunciation and use of swear words remain unchanged.&lt;ref name="journal.frontiersin.org"/&gt;

Patients who are affected by [[transcortical sensory aphasia]], a rare form of aphasia, have been found to exhibit formulaic language that is characterised by "lengthy chunks of memorized material".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuchico.edu/~pmccaffrey/syllabi/SPPA336/336unit8.html McCaffrey, Patrick. Transcortical Sensory Aphasia. ''The Neuroscience on the Web Series: Neuropathologies of Language and Cognition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apraxia of speech====

The characteristics of apraxia of speech include difficulties in imitating speech sounds, imitating no-speech movements, such as sticking out the tongue, groping for sounds, and in severe cases, the inability to produce any sounds, inconsistent errors and a slow rate of speech. However, patients who suffer from apraxia of speech may retain the ability to produce formulaic language, such as "thank you" or "how are you?".&lt;ref name=apraxia /&gt; Apraxia of speech can also occur in conjunction with dysarthria, an illness which inflicts muscle weakness affecting [[speech production]]), or aphasia, which causes language difficulties related to neurological damage.&lt;ref name=apraxia /&gt;

Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

'''Invective''' (from [[Middle English]] ''invectif'', or [[Old French]] and [[Late Latin]] ''invectus'') is abusive, reproachful, or venomous language used to express blame or censure; or, a form of rude expression or discourse intended to offend or hurt;&lt;ref&gt;"in·vec·tive."

== The genre of invective ==
The "genre of invective" or "invective (genre)" or "''vituperatio''" in Latin is a form of classical libel used in [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Roman]] polemical verse as well as in prose, but its primary context is rhetoric.

The rhetorical genre of ''vituperatio'' belongs to the ''genus demonstrativum'', which is composed by the praise and blame.

During the Roman Republic, personal invectives and character assassination were widely used during the forensic speeches as well as orations. Cicero made a large use of the invectives against his political foes such as Clodius, Catilina (Catilinarian speeches) or Mark Antony (Philippics). The commonly charges are avarice, cupidity, cowardice, effeminacy, drunkenness, low writing and speaking skills, luxury, disapproved sexual habits, tyrannical behaviour, etc.

Between 44 BC and 30 BC, the invective became a tool during the propaganda war between Octavian and Mark Antony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|publisher=Latomus|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among many other slanders, Mark Antony was accused to have married a foreign queen Cleopatra, to be the submissive subject of her and to have lose his Roman identity. According to this propaganda, Cleopatra would plan to invade Italia. This propaganda before the battle of Actium in 31 BC permits to Octavian to present his campaign as a legitimate war for the safe of the Roman Republic.

The preferred literary term for invective of the [[Renaissance]] is [[Libel (poetry)|libel]].

The term '''jay driver''' originated to refer to carriage drivers who drove on the incorrect side of the road. While the term may generally refer to an individual operating a vehicle in a manner not consistent with traffic laws, it was used more specifically to individuals who drive a vehicle on the incorrect side of the road. [[Merriam-Webster]] indicates that the first known use of the term is by ''The Junction City Union'' newspaper on June 28, 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-is-it-called-jaywalking|title=Why is it called Jay-Walking|last=|first=|date=|website=Merriam-Webster|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to "jaywalker"==
Most sources indicate that the term "jay driver" came before "[[jaywalker]]" there being numerous article headlines from 1905 through the next decade that include the term "Jay Driver." Peter Norton's book ''Fighting Traffic'' on 78  indicates that in 1922 use of the term "jay driver" was an attempt by George A. Davies to use the known meaning of "jay walker" and apply it to drivers of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norton |first1=Peter D |title=Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City |date=2008-04-18 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262141000 |pages=409 |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/fighting-traffic |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an opinion piece attributed to "A MAN BOOSTER" from the January 17, 1907 ''Salt Lake Telegram'' titled "Oh yes, there's the 'Jay Driver'" describes in it both jay walkers and jay drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=19031446|title=Oh, Yes, There's the "Jay Driver"|last=|first=|date=1907-01-17|work=Salt Lake Telegram|accessdate=10 August 2018|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another article from November 11, 1919 in ''The Pittsburgh Gazette Times'' cites from the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' the text: "There are so many jay walkers and so many jay drivers that it hardly behooves any driver to talk about jay walkers, or any walkjer to mention jay drivers," clearly demonstrating that the term existed prior to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1856231446?pq-origsite=summon|title=[untitled]|last=|first=|date=1919-11-11|work=The Pittsburgh Gazette Times|accessdate=10 August 2018|publisher=|issue=vol-134, iss-106|page=6|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
A 1939 instructional video overdubbed by the voice of an official from a British agency indicates that the term was not isolated to the United States. Titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peIZtd-ZJ8M School For Jay-Drivers!] the video provides an example of a motorcycle rider in Vienna failing to give the proper signal who is then required to attend a Sunday morning class in which an instructor explains what he did incorrectly and what the rules indicate he should have done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School for Jay Drivers! |url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/school-for-jay-drivers |website=British Pathe |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11654">The '''KE family''' is a medical name designated for a [[British people|British]] family, about half of whom exhibit a severe [[speech disorder]] called [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]].&lt;ref name=belton2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belton|first1=Emma|last2=Salmond|first2=Claire H.|last3=Watkins|first3=Kate E.|last4=Vargha-Khadem|first4=Faraneh|last5=Gadian|first5=David G.|title=Bilateral brain abnormalities associated with dominantly inherited verbal and orofacial dyspraxia|journal=Human Brain Mapping|volume=18|issue=3|pages=194–200|doi=10.1002/hbm.10093|pmid=12599277|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first family with speech disorder to be investigated using [[genetic analyses]], by which the speech impediment is discovered to be due to [[genetic mutation]], and from which the gene ''[[FOXP2]]'', often dubbed the "language gene", was discovered. Their condition is also the first human speech and language disorder known to exhibit strict [[Mendelian inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nudel|first1=Ron|last2=Newbury|first2=Dianne F|title=FOXP2|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|date=2013|volume=4|issue=5|pages=547–560|doi=10.1002/wcs.1247|pmid=24765219|pmc=3992897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brought to medical attention from their school children in the late 1980s, the case of KE family was taken up at the [[UCL Institute of Child Health]] in [[London]] in 1990. Initial report suggested that the family was affected by a [[genetic disorder]]. Canadian [[linguist]] [[Myrna Gopnik]] suggested that the disorder was characterized primarily by grammatical deficiency, supporting the controversial notion of a "grammar gene". [[Geneticists]] at the [[University of Oxford]] determined that the condition was indeed genetic, but with complex physical and physiological effects, and in 1998, they identified the actual gene, eventually named ''FOXP2''. This discovery directly led to a broader knowledge on [[human evolution]] as the gene is directly implicated with the [[origin of language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Preuss|first1=T. M.|title=Human brain evolution: From gene discovery to phenotype discovery|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2012|volume=109|issue=Supplement_1|pages=10709–10716|doi=10.1073/pnas.1201894109|pmid=22723367|pmc=3386880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two family members, a boy and a girl, were featured in the [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] [[documentary film]] ''[[Human Ape]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Ape|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/asia/human-ape/videos/human-ape-evolution|website=National Geographic|publisher=NGC Europe Limited|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical investigations==

KE family children attended Elizabeth Augur's special educational needs unit at [[Brentford]] primary school in west London. Towards the end of 1980s seven children of the family attended there.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Jeremy|title=Not a Chimp: The Hunt to Find the Genes that Make Us Human|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-1916-1358-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXjGB_rFfUAC&amp;pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augur began to learn that the family had a speech disorder for three generations. Of the 30 members, about half suffer from severe deficiency, some are affected mildly, and few are unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watkins|first1=Kate E|last2=Gadian|first2=David G.|last3=Vargha-Khadem|first3=Faraneh|title=Functional and Structural Brain Abnormalities Associated with a Genetic Disorder of Speech and Language|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=1999|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1215–1221|doi=10.1086/302631|pmid=10521285|pmc=1288272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their faces show rigidity at the lower half, and most cannot complete pronouncing a word. Many of them have severe stuttering and with limited vocabulary. In particular, they have difficulty with consonants, and omit them, such as "boon" for "spoon", "able" for "table", and "bu" for "blue". Linguistic deficiency is also noted in written language both in reading and writing. They are characterized by lower nonverbal [[Intelligent Quotient|IQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargha-Khadem|first1=F.|last2=Watkins|first2=K.|last3=Alcock|first3=K.|last4=Fletcher|first4=P.|last5=Passingham|first5=R.|title=Praxic and nonverbal cognitive deficits in a large family with a genetically transmitted speech and language disorder.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1995|volume=92|issue=3|pages=930–933|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.3.930|pmid=7846081|pmc=42734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augur convinced the family to undergo medical studies and approached geneticist Michael Baraitser, of the Institute of Child Health. With colleagues Marcus Prembey and Jane Hurst, they started taking blood samples for analyses in 1987. Their first report in 1990 shows that 16 family members were affected by severe abnormality, though their intelligence and hearing are normal, and that the condition was genetically inherited ([[autosomal dominant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurst|first1=J. A.|last2=Baraitser|first2=M.|last3=Auger|first3=E.|last4=Graham|first4=F.|last5=Norell|first5=S.|title=An extended family with a dominantly inherited speech disorder|journal=Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology|date=1990|volume=32|issue=4|pages=352–355|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16948.x|pmid=2332125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the news, [[BBC]] was preparing a documentary of the case in the scientific serial ''Antenna''. By this time, a Canadian linguist from [[McGill University]], [[Myrna Gopnik]], was visiting her son in Oxford, and delivered an invited lecture at the university, where she noticed the flyer for the BBC programme. She contacted the medical geneticists, interviewed KE family members, and returned to [[Montreal, Quebec]]. She was convinced that the genetic defect was largely centred on grammatical ability, and wrote letters to [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gopnik|first1=M.|title=Genetic basis of grammar defect|journal=Nature|date=6 September 1990|volume=347|issue=6288|pages=26–26|doi=10.1038/347026a0|pmid=2395458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gopnik|first1=M.|title=Feature-blind grammar and dysphasia|journal=Nature|date=1990|volume=344|issue=6268|pages=715–715|doi=10.1038/344715a0|pmid=2330028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her reports promulgated a notion of "grammar gene" and a controversial concept of grammar-specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona|title=What's Within?: Nativism Reconsidered|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, US|isbn=978-0-1951-5978-3|pages=290–291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb1pvz1JhQYC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Lyle|title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the Biology of Language|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-5210-0391-9|pages=98–99|edition=Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2AN2f6GPFQC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of ''FOXP2'' gene===
Neuroscientist and language expert at the Institute of Child Health, [[Faraneh Vargha-Khadem]], began to investigate teaming up with University of Oxford and [[University of Reading]] linguists. In 1995 they found, contrary to Gopnik's hypothesis, from comparison of 13 affected and 8 normal individuals that the genetic disorder was a complex impairment of not only linguistic ability, but also intellectual and anatomical features, thereby disproving the "grammar gene" notion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargha-Khadem|first1=F.|last2=Watkins|first2=K.|last3=Alcock|first3=K.|last4=Fletcher|first4=P.|last5=Passingham|first5=R.|title=Praxic and nonverbal cognitive deficits in a large family with a genetically transmitted speech and language disorder.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1995|volume=92|issue=3|pages=930–933|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.3.930|pmid=7846081|pmc=42734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), they found that some brain regions were underactive (compared to baseline levels) in the KE family members and that some were overactive, when compared to normal people. The underactive regions included [[motor neurons]] that control face and mouth regions. The areas that were overactive includes [[Broca's area]], the speech centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargha-Khadem|first1=F.|last2=Watkins|first2=K. E.|last3=Price|first3=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28418">[[Ku Klux Klan]] nomenclature has evolved over the order's nearly 160 years of existence. The titles and designations were first laid out in the original Klan's prescripts of 1867 and 1868, then revamped with [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]]' [[Kloran]] of 1916. Subsequent Klans have made various modifications.

== Reconstruction period ==

The sources of the rituals, titles and even the name of the original KKK may be found in antebellum [[College fraternity|college fraternities]] and [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|secret societies]] such as the [[Kuklos Adelphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991, p.338&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lester (disambiguation)|John Lester]], one of the original members of the group, stated that the Klan rituals were "modeled on and embraced the leading features of the rituals of an order which has long been popular in many colleges and universities under various names" such as the [[Sons of Confucius]] or [[Guiasticutus]] but always styled '''Ancient and Honorable''' and '''Mirth-Provoking'''. [[Walter L. Fleming]] stated in a footnote to Lester's text that the contemporary (early twentieth century) Southern college fraternity that most nearly mirrored the early Klan was [[Alpha Sigma Sigma]] and the institution of [[snipe hunt]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lester|Lester, John C.]], ''Ku Klux Klan: Its Origin, Growth and Disbandment'' [[Walter L. Fleming]] ed. New York; Neale Publishing Company, 1905. Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
The original prescript of the Ku Klux Klan was adopted by a convention in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in April 1867. A slightly revised edition appeared the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II pp.133-176&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher levels ===
In both prescripts there were four levels or "departments" of organization, above the basic level:

*'''Empire''' – constituting the whole area of the Klan's activities. This was led by the '''[[Grand Wizard]]''' and his staff of ten '''Genii''', as well as a '''Grand Exchequer''' (treasurer) and '''Grand Scribe''', whose duty was to keep lists of the subordinate officers. The Genii, Imperial Exchequer and Scribe were appointed by the Imperial Wizard.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136–37, 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realms''' – while the role of Realms was laid out in the first prescript they were only identified as [[US states|states]] in the second. Realms were ruled by a '''Grand Dragon''' assisted by eight '''Hydras''', as well as a Grand Exchequer and Grand Scribe, whose duties were identical to the above officers on the imperial level. All officers were appointed by the Grand Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138, 155–56, 158–159. The states making up the "empire" were [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dominions''' – identified in the second prescript as "coterminous with such counties as the Grand Dragons of the several Realms shall assign" and "not to exceed three in number for each [[List of United States congressional districts|Congressional district]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.156, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion was headed by a '''Great Titan''' assisted by six '''Furies''', a Great Exchequer and a Great Scribe, appointed by the Great Titan.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138–39, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provinces''' – the second prescript identified the Provinces as equivalent to a [[Counties of the United States|county]]. It was supervised by a '''Grand Giant''', assisted by four '''Goblins''', a Grand Exchequer, and a Grand Scribe, appointed by the Grand Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first prescript each officer is given the power to appoint Deputies to organize Realms, Dominions, Provinces and Dens until the latter can elect their own officers.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.137–140&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Wizard was to be elected by a majority of Grand Dragons, and each lower level was elected by a majority of the next lower level of officers (Dragons elected by Titans, Titans by Giants etc.), as soon as three units had been formed at each level (three Dominions within a Realm for Grand Dragon, three Provinces within a Dominion for Grand Titan etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143–144&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript each officer appoints the lower officer with the approval of his superior.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 141, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dens ===

The '''Dens''' were the basic level of organization for the Reconstruction Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. ''The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia'' Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991 p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In the original prescript, its chief officer was the '''Grand Cyclops''', who appointed two '''Nighthawks''', a '''Grand Turk''', a '''Grand Sentinel, Grand Magi''' and a '''Grand Ensign''' in addition to his Grand Scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Cyclops, Grand Exchequer, '''Grand Magi''' (second officer) and '''Grand Monk''' (third officer) were elected by the body politic of the dens, identified as '''Ghouls'''&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.141-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript the Grand Ensign is dispensed with, while the Grand Exchequer was appointed by the Grand Cyclops, who was now appointed by the Grand Giant. Only the Grand Magi and Grand Monk were elected by the Ghouls.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.160-1, 165-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact function of these officers and the meaning of the titles varied. The two Nighthawks have been identified as couriers.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.428&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Sentinel was in charge of the "'''Grand Guard'''", an organization which is not otherwise elaborated upon in the prescripts, but apparently served as the Den's security detail.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Turk was the den's "[[executive officer]]" and was charged with informing Klansmen of "all informal or irregular meetings" and helping the Grand Cyclops and the Grand Magi maintain the "control and government" of the Den.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.142, 163&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Ensigns job was to take care of the Klan's flag.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initiation rites ===
The organ for initiation into the Klan was called the '''Investigating Committee''', composed of the Grand Cyclops, Grand Magi and Grand Monk. Upon the nomination of a new member by a current member, the committee would investigate the candidate's "antecedents and his past and present standings and connections" and would then pronounce the candidate "competent and worthy" to become a member. The Grand Turk would escort the candidate to an "outpost" where he would question him and administer a preliminary [[oath]]. After this the Grand Turk would conduct the candidate to the Den, where the Grand Cyclops would administer the final oath.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140-1, 142, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; The second prescript elaborates that the candidate must have his left hand on the [[Bible]] and his right hand toward heaven and includes a ten-point "interrogation" that the candidate must answer satisfactorily in order to proceed with the final oath. The questions asked included: are you now or have ever been a member of the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican Party]], [[Loyal Leagues]] or [[Grand Army of the Republic]]? Did you fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]? Do you believe in [[racial equality|Negro equality]]? among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tribunals ===
A system of "judiciary" organs was created in each prescript. In the first the judiciary was divided into a '''Grand Council of Yahoos''', to try officers of the Klan, and a '''Grand Council of Centaurs''' to try regular Ghouls. In Art.IV Sec.4, the Grand Giant is charged with conducting the Council of Yahoo, but Art.VI Sec.2 states that the Council will be composed of officers of the equivalent rank as the accused and presided over by an officer of the next higher rank. A trial of the Grand Wizard would be held by a meeting of all the Grand Dragons, the most senior Grand Dragon presiding&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140, 144&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if these tribunals were ever functional.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prescript presented an entirely different judiciary, with officers of the first three levels tried by three judges, appointed by the chief officer of the given jurisdiction, and the officers and attaches of the headquarters (presumably the Genii, Hydras, and Furies). Trials of Den officers would be conducted at the provincial headquarters and include five judges, and ordinary ghouls to be tried at their dens with seven judges. As before a trial of the Grand Wizard would be conducted by the most senior Grand Dragon, this time with a quorum of seven dragons. All defendants had the right of appeal to the next higher court, and the proceeding was to be governed as "ordinary [[Court-martial|court martials]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.16-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
In addition to the structure outlined above, there are documented cases of organs of slightly different nomenclature from Reconstruction. For instance, a group of twenty men who were arrested on April 6, 1868, at their "den" at the corners of [[Beale Street]] and Hernando street in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], was called the '''Supreme Cyclopean Council'''. The constitution that the police captured outlined an organization with a Grand Cyclops, Vice-Grand Cyclops, and Secretary and openly advocated assassination of the "murders and robbers" now ruling the South. Members were bound to participate in the activities of the order, even if it meant leaving the "embraces" of their wife.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Henry Townsend]] ''The Handbook of the year'' London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1868 p.293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Trelease]] ''White terror: the Ku Klux Klan conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The complete constitution, which identifies the group as part of the KKK was printed in [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038521/1868-04-09/ed-1/seq-1/ Nashville union and dispatch. Vol XXXIV #105 April 09, 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; A '''Grand Klan''', composed of delegates from [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[York County, South Carolina|York]], [[Union County, South Carolina|Union]], and [[Chester County, South Carolina|Chester]] counties in South Carolina and a few from North Carolina met in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] and declared that no more raids or whippings would be conducted by members of the Klan except by their order and that the penalty for violating this order would be 100 lashes for the first offense and death for the second.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Joint Select Committee Appointed to Inquire Into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, So Far as Regards the Execution of Laws, and the Safety of the Lives and Property of the Citizens of the United States and Testimony Taken: Report of the Joint committee, Views of the minority and Journal of the Select committee, April 20, 1871-Feb. 19, 1872'' Washington; GPO 1872 p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt was apparently made to make Ghoul titles for other officers in [[Maury County, Tennessee]] in 1867 and early 1868, but the result was only confusion. Additionally a "'''Grand Tycoon'''" notified Klansmen in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] to cease night riding and the order was apparently effective in restoring calm to [[Wilson County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.236-7&lt;/ref&gt; In some early reconstruction Klan units there was also a '''Lictor''', whose role as a guard of the den was later subsumed by the Nighthawks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.348&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Era ==
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. which existed from 1915 to 1944, elaborated on the original prescript in its Kloran and in the constitution and by-laws adopted in 1922. Some titles and jurisdictional designations were carried over from the Reconstruction prescripts intact or slightly modified, and others were original with Imperial Wizard Simmons.

=== Jurisdictions ===
*'''Invisible Empire''' – this designation included both the Klans geographical domain – up to "the whole world" - but also in a "spiritual sense" all the secrets and workings of the order. All things outside this empire were designated the '''Alien World''' and non-members '''Aliens'''.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc ''[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/constitutionlawsknights.pdf Constitution and Laws of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc]'' Atlanta, Ga; Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc 1921 [pref. Nov. 1922] pp.12-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan was a military organization and its [[commander in chief]] was the '''Imperial Wizard''', whose power was supreme "within the limits of this Constitution" and whose edicts, decisions and rulings were binding on all members of the order.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He had a staff of '''Fifteen Genii'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire had an assembly or convention known as a '''Klonvokation'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realm''' – was carried over from the Reconstruction prescript, but it was no longer restricted to the [[Southern United States|Southern States]]; any state or territory of the United States could become a Realm, and Realms were also given a number based on the date of organization of the Realm. The convention of the Realm was designated the '''Klorero'''&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Realm remained the Grand Dragon; the other officers were collectively known as the '''Nine Hydras'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.45&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Province''' – in the new Klan, a Province was construed as "a county or number of counties" designated by the Grand Dragon. There were a maximum of six provinces per realm, but the Grand Dragon could create more with the permission of the Imperial Wizard. The Provincial convention was the '''Klonverse'''. The chief officer of a Province was a '''Great Titan''', and the other officers were known as the '''Seven Furies'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan''' – the basic unit of the Second Era KKK was known simply as a Klan. Its area of jurisdiction was a '''Klanton''' which was defined as "extend[ing] in all directions to a distance midway between the location of the Klan and the nearest Klan thereto" unless otherwise directed by the Grand Dragon or Imperial Wizard. The chief officer of a Klan was an '''Exalted Cyclops''' and the subordinate officers were known as the '''Twelve Terrors'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13–14, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Officials ===
There was a nearly identical set of subordinate officers at each level:&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23, 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klaliff''' – [[vice president]]
*'''Klokard''' – [[lecturer]]
*'''Kludd''' – [[chaplain]]
*'''Kligrapp''' – [[secretary]]
*'''Klabee''' – [[treasurer]]
*'''Kladd''' – "conductor", in charge of initiating new members
*'''Klarogo''' – inner guard, [[serjeant-at-arms]]
*'''Klexter''' – outer guard
*'''Nighthawks''' – couriers

The officers at each level above the local Klan unit were designated by a unique prefix: '''Imperial''' at the Empire level; '''Grand''' at the Realm level; and '''Great''' at the Province level. Thus, for instance, an Imperial Kludd would be the chaplain for the whole organization, a Grand Kludd for the Realm, Great Kludd for a Province and simply Kludd for a local Klan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 46, 48, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all offices were reproduced at each level. The Kladd, Klarogo, Klexter, and Klokard were not present at the Province level, and the Kladd was not included on the Realm level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Klazik''', second vice-president, and '''Klonsul''', attorney, positions only existed at the Imperial level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.29, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Klazik's duties included being head of the department of Realms and organizing new Realms and Provinces&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.45–48,&lt;/ref&gt; At the Province level there were three Klaliffs that served as an advisory board. A '''Klokann''' of three members, each one named a '''Klokan''', filled this role at the local levels and a Klokann of four members at the Imperial level, in which they served as a "Supreme Board of Auditors and Special Advisers and was led by a Chief Imperial Klokan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 33, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Wizards Genii constituted his '''Imperial Kloncilium'''; this was the Imperial Wizards supreme [[advisory board]], as well as the Klans highest administrative organ in between Klonvokations. It met regularly every July, but could also be called when the Imperial Wizard or five Geniis petitioned him to do so. The Kloncilium was also the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the organization with [[appellate jurisdiction]] and the right to finally determine disputes between Realms, Provinces, Klans and members in unorganized states&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giant''' was adopted as an [[emeritus]] title: Imperial Giant for an ex-Imperial Wizard, Grand Giant for an ex-Grand Dragon, Great Giant for ex-Great Titan and Klan Giant for an ex-Exalted Cyclops.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Kleagle]]''' was a recruiter and was responsible for organizing local Klans.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-1944 ==

Since the dissolution of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. in 1944, there have been many Klan groups. Details of the nomenclature have varied, somewhat, among the different groups, but some terms have had more currency than others. Over time, the term '''klavern''' replaced klan for local groups.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.322&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard and Grand Dragon have still been generally used for the leader of a Klan organization and for state (realm) leaders. Exceptions included cases of one state Klans, such as the [[Association of Georgia Klans]], whose leader [[Dr. Samuel Green]], kept the title Grand Dragon until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] created some innovations in their organization including a bicameral '''Klongress''' with an [[upper house]] Klonvokation and [[Lower house|lower]] '''Klanburgess'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.321-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s [[David Duke]]'s [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] dropped the Imperial Wizard title, and the leader was called national director.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; That organization, now known as the Knights Party, no longer uses most of the traditional Klan titles, and the only fraternal titles used are '''Page''', '''Squire''' and '''Knight''' for levels of membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kkk.bz/main/?page_id=43 Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
Aside from titles and geographical designations, a distinctive vocabulary has grown around the Ku Klux Klan organizations. These include names for rituals, code words, and practices of the various Klans.

*'''Klankraft''' or '''Klanishness''' – the overall practice and state of being a Klan member. This could be defined as the employment and patronizing of fellow Klansmen, as well as sale of official Klan memorabilia, such as T-shirts, watches and belt buckles.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard [[Robert Shelton (Ku Klux Klan)|Robert Shelton]] gave this definition "...robes, cross lightings and parades, the mysticism, everything that made the Klan the Klan".&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League ''Danger: Extremism; the major voices and vehicles on America far right fringe'' New York; Anti-Defamation League 1996 p.251&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions included maintaining the sanctity of one's home, maintenance of white supremacy and purity, and loyalty to the Klan itself.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ''The Practice of Klanishness'' 1924 p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
There are terms related to membership and non-membership:&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League pp.392-3&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Alien''' – a non-member
*'''Naturalization''' – the Klan [[Initiation rites|initiation ceremony]]
*'''Citizen''' – a Klan member
*'''Passport''' – [[membership card]]
*'''Banished''' – expelled from the Klan
*'''Yellow dog''' – a [[hazing]] ritual similar to the type used in [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|college fraternities]]; when practiced by imperial officers, called the '''Royal Order of the Purple Dog'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.627&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groups ===
Groups of Klansmen commissioned for "special activities"
*'''Wrecking Crew''' – an action squad commissioned to take physical action against enemies and wayward members of the Klan. Depending on time and organization, these groups consisted of 5 to 8 members and were authorized either by the klokann, the Exalted Cyclops and/or the Kludd. Sometimes led by the Nighthawk. An action taken by the crew is '''wrecked'''. Some names used by wrecking crews include "Secret Six", "Ass-tear Squad" and "Holy terrors".&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.393&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan Bureau of Investigation''' – Pioneered by the Mississippi White Knights, these groups investigate the Klans enemies and check leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Anti-Defamation League p.292"&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.292&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Degree teams''' – a group which performs the task of initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
*'''Klectoken''' or '''Klecktokon''' – initiation fee. It stabilized around $10 before the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"/&gt;
*'''Imperial tax''' – membership dues&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provincial tax''' – secondary dues, paid per capita for the upkeep of a Realm.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code words and phrases ===
*'''A.Y.A.K.''' or '''Ayak''' – "Are you a Klansman?" to be answered with below.
*'''A.K.I.A.''' or '''Akia''' – "A Klansman I am"; these were code words for Klansmen meeting in strange surroundings. They would be inserted into common conversation, for instance "Does a Mr. Ayak live in this neighborhood?" to be responded by "No, but a Mr. Akia does." The password would then be accompanied by a [[secret handshake]] or other sign of recognition.&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.30-1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''K.I.G.Y''' or '''Kigy''' – "Klansman, I greet you"&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="splcenter1"&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan Ku Klux Klan]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''O.R.I.O.N''' – Our Race Is Our Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/hate_symbols/ORION.asp |title=A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''L.O.T.I.E''' or '''LOTIE''' – Lady Of The Invisible Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Axelrod]] ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'' New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.144. This was one of a number of names for Klan women's auxiliaries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates and times ===

Two KKK codes for dates and times have been developed, the '''Ku Klux Register''' in the original prescripts and the '''Kalender''' developed by William J. Simmons.

==== Ku Klux Register ====

In the original prescripts the register contained twelve designations, thought to correspond to months:&lt;ref name=" Newton and Newton, p.337"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}

*8th-'''Terrible'''
*9th-'''Horrible'''
*10th-'''Melancholy'''
*11th-'''Mournful'''
*12th-'''Dying'''
{{col-end}}

The second prescript had a slightly different scheme.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-end}}

==== Kalender ====

The Kalender developed by W. J. Simmons included codes for days of the week, weeks, months and years. For months:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, pp.307-8"&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.307-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitution p.87"&gt;''Constitution'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

*11th-'''Frightful'''
*12th-'''Appalling'''
{{col-end}}

For weeks and days:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, pp.307-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitution p.87"/&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*Weeks
*1-'''Woeful'''

*2-'''Deadly'''
*3-'''Dismal'''
*4-'''Doleful'''
*5-'''Desolate'''
*6-'''Dreadful'''
*7-'''Desperate'''
{{col-end}}

Years were reckoned according to '''reigns''' and '''cycles'''. The '''Reign of Incarnation and Incantation''' was all time up to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The '''First Reign of our Incarnation and Incantation''' was the period between the Revolution and the establishment of the original Klan, which was reckoned to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The '''Reign of our Second Incarnation and Incantation''' was reckoned between 1866 and Grand Wizard [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s dissolution of the Klan, which is reckoned to 1872. The '''Reign of our Third Incarnation and Incantation''' began in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.88, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan year, '''Anno Klanslar''', began in March of each year, and the cycle was reckoned from December of each calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Language planning''' (also known as '''language engineering''') is a deliberate effort to influence the function, structure, or acquisition of [[languages]] or [[dialects|language variety]] within a [[speech community]].&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[government]] planning, but is also used by a variety of [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as grass-roots organizations, and individuals. Goals of such planning vary. Better communication through assimilation of a single dominant language can bring economic benefits to minorities but is also perceived to facilitate their political domination.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds. Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies, to design or develop new structures to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Language: An Introduction,'' Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ideology ==

Four overarching [[language ideology|language ideologies]] motivate decision making in language planning.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;  The first, linguistic assimilation, is the belief that every member of a society, irrespective of their [[First language|native language]], should learn and use the dominant language of the society in which they live.  An example is the [[English-only movement]] of some residents of the [[United States]].

In contrast is the second ideology, linguistic pluralism - the recognition and support of multiple languages within one society.  Examples include the coexistence of [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]] in [[Switzerland]]; and the shared official status of [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Singapore]].  The coexistence of many languages may not necessarily arise from a conscious language ideology, but rather related to the relative efficiency in communication of a common language.

The third ideology, vernacularization, denotes the restoration and development of an indigenous language, along with its adoption by the state as an [[official language]].  Examples include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the state of [[Israel]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in [[Peru]].

The final ideology, internationalization, is the adoption of a non-indigenous language as a means of wider communication, as an official language or in a particular domain, such as the use of English in [[India]], Singapore, the [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[South Africa]].

==Goals==

Eleven language planning goals have been recognized (Nahir 2003):&lt;ref name=Nahir&gt;Nahir, Moshe. "Language Planning Goals: A Classification." ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings.'' Eds.  Paulston, Christina Bratt and G. Richard Tucker.  Oxford: Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language Purification – prescription of usage in order to preserve the "[[linguistic purism|linguistic purity]]" of language, protect language from foreign influences, and guard against language deviation from within
# [[Language revitalization|Language Revival]] – the attempt to restore to common use a language that has few or no surviving native speakers&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann claims that any attempt to revive a no-longer spoken language is likely to end up with a hybrid - see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Language reform|Language Reform]] – deliberate change in specific aspects of language, such as [[orthography]], [[spelling]], or [[grammar]], in order to facilitate use
# Language Standardization – the attempt to garner [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] for a regional language or dialect, developing it as the chosen major language, or [[standard language]], of a [[region]]
# Language Spread – the attempt to increase the number of speakers of a language
# Lexical Modernization – word creation or adaptation
# Terminology Unification – development of unified [[terminology|terminologies]], primarily in technical domains
# Stylistic Simplification – simplification of language usage in [[lexicon]], grammar, and style. That includes modifying the use of language in social and formal contexts.
# Interlingual Communication – facilitation of linguistic communication between members of distinct speech communities
# Language Maintenance – preservation of the use of a group's native language as a first or [[second language]] where pressures threaten or cause a decline in the status of the language
# Auxiliary-Code Standardization – standardization of marginal, auxiliary aspects of language, such as signs for the deaf, place names, or rules of [[transliteration]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]

== Types ==
Language planning has been divided into three types:

=== Status planning ===
Status planning is the allocation or reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status, or standing, of a language.

==== Language status ====
Language status is a concept distinct from, though intertwined with, language [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and language function. Strictly speaking, language status is the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma," in ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A language garners status according to the fulfillment of four attributes, described in 1968 by two different authors, [[Heinz Kloss]] and [[William Alexander Stewart|William Stewart]]. Both Kloss and Stewart stipulated four qualities of a language that determine its status. Their respective frameworks differ slightly, but they emphasize four common attributes:
# Language origin – whether a given language is indigenous or imported to the speech community
# Degree of standardization – the extent of development of a formal set of norms that define 'correct' usage
# Juridical status
##Sole official language (e.g. French in France and Turkish in Turkey)
##Joint official language (e.g. English and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]; French, German, Italian and Romansh in Switzerland)
##Regional official language (e.g. [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]] in [[Maharashtra]], India)
##Promoted language – lacks official status on a national or regional level but is promoted and sometimes used by public authorities for specific functions (e.g. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[West African Pidgin English]] in [[Cameroon]])
##Tolerated language – neither promoted nor proscribed; acknowledged but ignored (e.g. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] in the [[United States]] in present day)
##Proscribed language – discouraged by official sanction or restriction (e.g. Galician, Basque and Catalan during [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in Spain; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in [[Greece]]);&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. "Planning," in ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous American languages during the [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school era]]&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;cite [http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree,  "American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing"], Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vitality – the ratio, or percent, of users of a language to another variable, like the total population.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias/&gt; Kloss and Stewart both distinguish six classes of statistical distribution. However, they draw the line between classes at different percentages. According to Kloss, the first class, the highest level of vitality, is demarcated by 90% or more speakers. The five remaining classes in decreasing order are 70–89%, 40–69%, 20–39%, 3–19%, and less than 3%. Stewart defines the six classes are determined by the following percentages of speakers: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and less than 5%.

Together, origin, degree of standardization, juridical status, and vitality express a language's status.

William Stewart outlines ten functional domains in language planning:&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, William A.  "Sociolinguistic Typology of Multilingualism," in ''Readings in the Sociology of Language''.  Ed. Joshua Fishman.  The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Official – An official language "function[s] as a legally appropriate language for all politically and culturally representative purposes on a nationwide basis."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;  Often, the official function of a language is specified in a [[constitution]].
#Provincial – A provincial language functions as an official language for a geographic area smaller than a nation, typically a [[province]] or [[region]] (e.g. French in [[Quebec]])&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Robert L.  ''Language Planning and Social Change''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wider communication – A language of wider communication is a language that may be official or provincial, but more importantly, functions as a medium of communication across language boundaries within a nation (e.g. [[Hindi]] in India; [[Swahili language]] in [[East Africa]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#International – An international language functions as a medium of communication across national boundaries (e.g. English, formerly French as a diplomatic and international language)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Capital – A capital language functions as a prominent language in and around a national [[capital (political)|capital]] (e.g. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and French in [[Brussels]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Group – A group language functions as a conventional language among the members of a single cultural or ethnic group (e.g. Hebrew amongst the [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Educational – An educational language functions as a medium of instruction in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools on a regional or national basis ([[Urdu]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[East Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#School subject – A school subject language is a language that is taught as a subject in secondary school or [[higher education]] (e.g. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] in English-language schools)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Literary – A literary language functions as a language for [[literature|literary]] or [[scholarly]] purposes (Ancient Greek)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Religious – A religious language functions as a language for the ritual purposes of a particular religion (e.g. Latin for the [[Latin Rite]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Arabic]] for the reading of the [[Qur'an]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

Robert Cooper, in reviewing Stewart's list, makes several additions.  First, he creates three sub-types of official functions: statutory, working, and symbolic.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  A statutory language is a language that a government has declared official by law. A working language is a language that a government uses as a medium for daily activities, and a symbolic language is a language that is a [[symbol]] of the state. Cooper also adds two functional domains to Stewart's list: mass media and work.

===Corpus planning===
Corpus planning refers to the [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes in the structure of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). ''Language Planning and Education.'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions.&lt;ref name=Hornberger&gt;Hornberger, Nancy H. (2006). "Frameworks and Models in Language Policy and Planning", in Thomas Ricento, ''An Introduction to Language Policy'', Wiley-Blackwell, pp 24-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.

====Graphization====
Graphization refers to development, selection and modification of [[writing system|scripts]] and orthographic conventions for a language.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J. (2005). "Corpus Planning: Syllabus and Materials Development," in Eli Hinkel, ''Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning'', Routledge, pp 993-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of writing in a speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared.&lt;ref name=FergusonC&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. (1968). "Language Development", in Charles A. Ferguson, Thom Huebner (1996), ''Sociolinguistic Perspectives: papers on language in society, 1959-1994'', Oxford University Press US, pp 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]] made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing adds another variety of the language to the community's repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the [[vocabulary]], [[grammar|grammatical structures]] and [[phonology|phonological structures]] of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the 'real' language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may have been based on a divergent variety of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

In establishing a writing system for a language, corpus planners have the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Japan]] chose to adopt the [[Japanese language]]'s [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] as the writing system for the [[Ainu language]]. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV [[syllable structure]], but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final [[syllable coda|codas]] are [[consonants]] by a [[subscript]] version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat /&gt;

An example on a created script includes the development of the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] in 405 AD by [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop Mashtots]]. Though the script was modeled after the [[Greek alphabet]], the original script distinguished Armenian from the Greek and [[Syriac alphabet]]s of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Similarly, in the early 19th century, [[Sequoyah]] (Cherokee) created an orthography for written [[Cherokee]] in the Southeast of the present-day United States. It uses some Latin characters but also introduces new ones.

====Standardization====
The process of Standardization often involves one variety of a language taking precedence over other social and regional [[dialect]]s of a language.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). "Language Planning: the view from linguistics", in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes to be understood as supra-dialectal and the 'best' form of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The choice of which language takes precedence has important societal consequences, as it confers privilege upon speakers whose spoken and written dialect conforms closest to the chosen standard.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, Terrance G. (2003). "Language Planning and Policy," in Sandra McKay, Nancy H. Horberger, ''Sociolinguistics and Language Teaching'', Cambridge University Press, pp 103-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard that is chosen as the norm is generally spoken by the most powerful social group within the society, and is imposed upon the less powerful groups as the form to emulate. This often reinforces the dominance of the powerful social group and makes the standard norm necessary for socioeconomic mobility.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; In practice, standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] of the norm.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The history of English provides an example of standardization occurring over an extended time period, without formally recognized language planning. The standardization process began when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] in [[England]] in 1476. This was accompanied by the adoption of the south-east [[English Midlands|Midlands]] variety of English, spoken in [[London]], as the print language. Because of the dialect's use for administrative, government, business, and literary purposes, this variety became entrenched as the prestigious variety of English. After the creation of [[grammar]]s and [[dictionaries]] in the 18th century, the rise of print [[Capitalism#As a mode of production|capitalism]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and [[mass education]] led to the dissemination of this dialect as the standard norm for the English language.

====Modernization====
Modernization is a form of language planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a [[country]] gains [[independence]] from a [[colonialism|colonial power]] or when there is a change in the language [[education policy]].&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the [[lexicon]], which allows the language to discuss topics in modern [[semantic domain]]s. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and [[glossary|glossaries]] to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], have experienced rapid lexical expansion to meet the demands of modernization, other languages, such as [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt; Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of [[linguistic purism]] often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language's own process of [[word formation]] or from extensive [[loanword|borrowing]] from another language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC/&gt; While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.

=== Acquisition planning ===
Acquisition planning is a type of language planning in which a national, state or local government system aims to influence aspects of language, such as language status, distribution and literacy through education. Acquisition planning can also be used by non-governmental organizations, but it is more commonly associated with government planning.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning." ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a [[multilingualism|bilingual]] language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote [[language revitalization]], which can change a language's status or reverse a [[language shift]], or to promote linguistic purism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Language Planning Processes"''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.

====The education sector====
The education [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] or education sector of government is typically in charge of making national [[language acquisition]] decisions based on state and local evaluation reports. The responsibilities of education sectors vary by country; [[Robert B. Kaplan]] and Richard B. Baldauf describe the sectors' six principal goals:&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

# To decide what languages should be taught within the [[curriculum]].
# To determine the amount and quality of [[teacher training]].
# To involve local [[communities]].
# To determine what materials will be used and how they will be incorporated into [[syllabi]].
# To establish a local and state [[Educational assessment|assessment]] system to monitor progress.
# To determine financial [[cost]]s.

====Problems====
Although acquisition planning can be useful to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.&lt;ref name= Thorburn&gt;Thorburn, Thomas. "Cost-Benefit Analysis in Language Planning." ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.&lt;ref name= Thorburn /&gt;

====Multilingualism====
There is also a growing concern over the treatment of [[multilingualism]] in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Mansor, Sabiha. ''Language Planning in Higher Education''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several [[first language|(native) languages]]. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity.&lt;ref name= Fishman&gt;Fishman, Joshua A. "The Impact of Nationalism on Language Planning," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some states prefer incorporating different languages in order to help students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In addition to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or organizations that have a significant effect on language acquisition, such as the [[Académie française]] of France or the [[Real Academia Española]] of Spain.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt; These organizations often create their own dictionaries and grammar books, thus affecting the materials which students are exposed to in schools. Although these organizations do not hold official power, they influence government planning decisions, such as with educational materials, affecting acquisition.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

====Ireland====
Before the partition of [[Ireland]], a movement began which aimed at the restoration of [[Irish language|Irish]], as the nation's primary language, based on a widespread sentiment for Irish nationalism and cultural identity.&lt;ref name= Macnamara&gt;Macnamara, John. "Successes and Failures in the Movement for the Restoration of Irish," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; During and after colonisation, Irish had competed with English and [[Scots language|Scots]];  the movement to restore the language gained momentum after the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] was created to promote the acquisition of Irish in schools, thus "de-Anglicizing" Ireland.&lt;ref name= Macnamara /&gt; Immediately after Ireland gained independence in 1922, the League declared that Irish must be the language of instruction for at least one hour in primary schools nationwide. Irish-speaking teachers were recruited, and preparatory colleges were established to train new ones.

The program implementation was mostly left to the individual schools, which did not consistently carry it out. Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus as to how the Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Giolla Chriost, Diarmait. "Micro-level Language Planning in Ireland." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''  Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case study: Quechua in Peru ==

=== Status planning ===
[[Peru]]'s history of language planning begins in the 16th century with Spanish [[colonization]].  When the Spanish first arrived in Peru, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] served as a language of wider communication, a lingua franca, between Spaniards and Peruvian natives. As the years passed, Spaniards asserted the superiority of the Spanish language; as a result, Spanish gained prestige, taking over as a language of wider communication and the dominant language of Peru.&lt;ref name= CoronelM&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. "Functional Domains of the Quechua Language in Peru: Issues of Status Planning." University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, under the leadership of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the revolutionary government of Peru declared Quechua an official language of the Peruvian state, "coequal with Spanish."&lt;ref name=Hornberger2&gt;Hornberger, Nancy and Kendell A. King. "Authenticity and Unification in Quechua Language Planning." University of Pennsylvania: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the law was reversed.&lt;ref name=CoronelM /&gt; Peru's 1979 [[constitution]] declares Spanish the only official language of the state; Quechua and Aymara are relegated to "official use zones," equivalent to Stewart's provincial function described above. Quechua has officially remained a provincial language since 1979.  Today, Quechua also serves a limited international function throughout [[South America]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]; communities of Quechua speakers outside Peru enable communication in Quechua across borders. Still, because of Quechua's low status, Spanish is almost always used as the lingua franca instead. Recently, Quechua has also gained ground in the academic world, both as a school subject and a topic of literary interest.

=== Corpus planning ===
The three main types of corpus planning are all evident in the development of Quechua languages in Peru since the colonial era. Graphization has been in process since the arrival of the Spanish in the region, when the Spanish imperialists attempted to describe the exotic sounds of the language to Europeans.&lt;ref name= Coronel&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. (1996). "Corpus Planning for the Southern Peruvian Quechua Language." ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics,'' 12 (2), pp 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Quechua was made an official language in Peru in 1975, the introduction of the language into the education and government domains made it essential to have a standard written language.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;  The task of adopting a writing system proved to be a point of contention among Peruvian linguists. Although most agreed to use the [[Latin alphabet]], linguists disagreed about how to represent the phonological system of Quechua, particularly in regards to the vowel system. Representatives from the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua|Peruvian Academy of the Quechua language]] and the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] wanted to represent [[allophone]]s of the [[vowel]]s /i/ and /u/ with separate letters &lt;e&gt; and &lt;o&gt;, which creates an apparent five-vowel system. They argued that this makes the language easier to learn for people who are already familiar with written Spanish. However, other Peruvian linguists argued that a three-vowel system was more faithful to the [[phonology]] of Quechua. After several years of debate and disagreement, in 1985 Peruvian linguists proposed the Pan-Quechua alphabet as an accurate representation of the language, and this was adopted in [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs and textbooks. However, the Peruvian Academy and the SIL both refused to adopt it and continued to propose new alphabets, leaving the issue unsettled.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt; For more information, see [[Quechua languages#Writing system|Quechua writing system]] and [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]]. Another of the primary issues disagreements was about how to reflect the phonological differences apparent in different dialects of Quechua. For example, some distinct dialects utilize [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalization|glottalized]] versions of the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless uvular stop /q/]], while others do not and some language planners found it important to reflect these dialectal differences.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

The search for a unified alphabet reflects the process of standardization. Unlike other cases of standardization, in Quechua this has been applied only to the written language, not to the spoken language, and no attempt was made to change the spoken language of native speakers, which varied by regions. Rather, standardization was required in order to create a uniform writing system to provide education to Quechua speakers in their native language.

Language planners in Peru have proposed several varieties to serve as the supradialectal spoken norm. Some saw [[Qusqu-Qullaw]] as the natural choice for a standard norm, as it is recognized to be the variety closest to that spoken by the Incas. Others argued that [[Ayacucho Quechua]] is a better option, as the language is more conservative and similar to the proto-language, while Qusqu-Qullaw has been influenced by contact with the [[Aymara language]].

[[Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino]] proposed a standard literary norm, [[Southern Quechua]] that combines features of both these dialects. This norm has been accepted by many institutions in Peru.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

Lexical modernization has also been critical to the development of Quechua. Language planners have attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

=== Acquisition planning ===
Since Quechua is no longer an official language of Peru, Quechua literacy is not consistently encouraged in schools.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3&gt;Hornberger, Nancy "Quechua Literacy and Empowerment." ''Indigenous Literacies in the Americas'' Ed. Hornberger, Nancy. New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's education system is instead primarily based on Spanish, the nation's official language. Despite its low prestige, Quechua is still spoken by millions of indigenous Peruvians, a large portion of whom are bilingual in Quechua and Spanish. There is a desire to preserve the uniqueness of Quechua as a language with its own attributes and representations of culture. Some argue that promoting a diverse literacy program gives students diverse perspectives on life, which could only enhance their educational experience.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3 /&gt; Before 1975, Peru had bilingual education programs, but Quechua was not taught as a subject in primary and secondary schools.  After the 1975 education reform, Quechua and Spanish both had standing in bilingual programs, but only in restricted speech communities. These experimental programs were then canceled due to a change in government planning, but again reinstated in 1996. Even with national [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs, teachers at local schools and members of the community often prefer using Spanish, destabilizing support for bilingual education.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt; This underscores the importance of community support as a goal for the education sector as mentioned earlier. Some believe that due to Spanish's higher national prestige, it is more socially and economically beneficial to learn and speak Spanish. It is debatable whether these education programs will benefit education or raise the status of Quechua.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt;

'''Level of detail''' in writing, sometimes known as level of abstraction, refers to three concepts: the precision in using the right [[word]]s to form [[phrase]]s, clauses and sentences;&lt;ref&gt;p.204, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt; the generality of [[Statement (logic)|statements]]; and the organisational strategy in which authors [[Expository writing#Classification|arrange]] ideas according to a common topic in the [[hierarchy]] of detail. Placing different objects or ideas in categories is a type of classification in [[expert writing]] which allows more efficient cognitive retrieval of information by placing it in [[Context principle|context]].&lt;ref&gt;p.396, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining appropriate level of detail in any body of text is a part of ensuring that the cognitive effort required by the reader is appropriate to the general subject of the written as a whole. Authors use level of detail to maintain [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in [[syntactic hierarchy]] in texts, such as a [[screenplay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;p.227, Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt; Continuity in text is achieved by using [[transitional expressions]] to move from one detail, or level of detail, to another.&lt;ref&gt;p.223, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the basic writing structure of ''introducing'', ''characterising'' and ''bringing to a close'' of any proper subject description,&lt;ref&gt;p.204, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt; level of detail is used in [[theme development]] during ''elaboration'', ''evaluation'' and ''adding context'' as a repertoire of retrieval strategies.&lt;ref&gt;p.395, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;  Van der Pool in 1995 had found that omission of detail in text structuring is an age-related effect that differentiates mature and young writers.&lt;ref&gt;pp.395-396, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the general rule that the level of detail must be both sufficient and appropriate
for the author's audience and their subject in literature intended for experts,&lt;ref&gt;p.25, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt; it is also used in primary and secondary education to assess student understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p.180, Levstik, Barton&lt;/ref&gt; In general the depth of detail is gradually developed to one appropriate for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;p.59, Alley&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggested list in identifying appropriate level of detail may include&lt;ref&gt;p.25, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sufficiency of information for the reader to exercise good judgement about the subject
* Sufficiency of information for the reader to take appropriate action
* Correctness of the information based on type of data
* Correctness of the information based on audience
* Level of detail appropriateness to the subject
* Level of detail appropriateness to the audience in size, required knowledge for comprehension or experience

Presenting the reader with specific details without first introducing it with general statements can be dangerous because it omits a [[Grammatical modifier|qualifier]], and therefore introduces elements that invite questions and create confusion.&lt;ref&gt;p.80, Alley&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of detail is often important in [[technical writing]] due to the need to differentiate between different levels of audience need for information within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;p.198, Alred, Brusaw, Oliu&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the engineering design process, writing also takes place by the author usually adopting either a top-down or a bottom-up process by identifying components of the text that become the focus subjects in the overall [[Theme (literature)|theme]].&lt;ref&gt;p.1018, Weik&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of a text is often assessed for its level of detail as ''high'', ''intermediate'' or ''low'' based on the objective of the author in addressing the needs of the audience. The highly detailed text refers to the bottom-up structuring design where &lt;blockquote&gt;
Facts that are generally available but not used frequently (and likely to be forgotten) should be included in this ideal level of writing.&lt;ref&gt;p.19, Harkins &amp; Plung&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; This level of detail is appropriate for the subjects where expert specialist knowledge and understanding are required, and is often used in technical and [[scientific writing]], or in literary genres like [[science fiction]], [[biography|biographical writing]]  or [[military history]].

[[File:Modus ponens logical form.jpg|thumb|This logical argument utilizing [[modus ponens]] makes use of three statements in logical form expressed in simplified English.]]
{{Hatnote|This article is about the term as used in logic. For the linguistics term, see [[Logical form (linguistics)]].}}
{{Redirect|Argument structure|the possible complements of a verb in linguistics|verb argument}}
In  [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], a '''logical form''' of a [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] expression is a precisely-specified [[Semantics|semantic]] version of that expression in a [[formal system]]. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly [[Ambiguity (syntax)|ambiguous]] statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system. In an ideal [[formal language]], the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from [[syntax]] alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one [[string (computer science)|string]] that represents the same logical form in a given language.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, CUP 1999, pp. 511–512&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical form of an [[argument]] is called the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of the argument.

==History==
The importance of the concept of form to logic was already recognized in ancient times. [[Aristotle]], in the [[Prior Analytics]], was probably the first to employ variable letters to represent valid inferences. Therefore, [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] claims that the introduction of variables was 'one of Aristotle's greatest inventions'.

According to the followers of Aristotle like [[Ammonius Hermiae|Ammonius]], only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, and not those given in concrete terms.  The concrete terms ''man'', ''mortal'', etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders 'A', 'B', 'C', which were called the 'matter' (Greek ''hyle'', Latin ''materia'') of the argument.

The term "logical form" itself was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1914, in the context of his program to formalize natural language and reasoning, which he called [[philosophical logic]]. Russell wrote: "Some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure."
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsY9g_DDA9MC&amp;pg=PA53 Russell, Bertrand. 1914(1993). Our Knowledge of the External World: as a field for scientific method in philosophy. New York: Routledge. p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PreyerPeter2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Gerhard Preyer |editor2=Georg Peter |title=Logical form and language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioVFUN8yd9QC&amp;pg=PA54 |year=2002 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-924555-0 |page=54 |chapter=What is logical form? |author=Ernie Lepore |author2=Kirk Ludwig}} [http://www.indiana.edu/~socrates/papers/What%20is%20Logical%20Form.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of argument form ==
To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.
;Original argument
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
;Argument form
:All ''H'' are ''M''.
:''S'' is ''H''.
:Therefore, ''S'' is ''M''.

All we have done in the ''Argument form'' is to put 'H' for 'human' and 'humans', 'M' for 'mortal', and 'S' for 'Socrates'; what results is the ''form'' of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the ''Argument form'' is the ''sentence form'' of its respective sentence in the original argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Patrick J.|title=A concise introduction to logic|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, Calif.|year=1988|isbn=0-534-08928-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of argument form==
Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[Validity (logic)|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. All logical form arguments are either inductive or deductive. Inductive logical forms include inductive generalization, statistical arguments, causal argument, and arguments from analogy. Common deductive argument forms are hypothetical syllogism, categorical syllogism, argument by definition, argument based on mathematics, argument from definition. The most reliable forms of logic are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and chain arguments because if the premises of the argument are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bassham, Gregory | title=Critical thinking : a student's introduction | publication-date=2012 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-07-803831-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]]. 

;Affirming the consequent
:All dogs are animals.
:Coco is an animal.
:Therefore, Coco is a dog.

;Denying the antecedent
:All cats are animals.
:Missy is not a cat.
:Therefore, Missy is not an animal.

A logical [[argument]], seen as an [[ordered set]] of sentences, has a logical form that [[compositionality|derives]] from the form of its constituent sentences; the logical form of an argument is sometimes called argument form.&lt;ref name="BeallBeall2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Beall|title=Logic: the Basics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLnTavNvIqYC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77498-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors only define logical form with respect to whole arguments, as the [[schema (logic)|schemata]] or inferential structure of the argument.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi |title=Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA386|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[argumentation theory]] or [[informal logic]], an argument form is sometimes seen as a broader notion than the logical form.&lt;ref name="Pinto2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Pinto|title=Argument, inference and dialectic: collected papers on informal logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK0a5CgyV7kC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-7005-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of stripping out all spurious grammatical features from the sentence (such as gender, and passive forms), and replacing all the expressions specific to ''the subject matter'' of the argument by [[schematic variable]]s.  Thus, for example, the expression 'all A's are B's' shows the logical form which is common to the sentences 'all men are mortals', 'all cats are carnivores', 'all Greeks are philosophers' and so on.

==Logical form in modern logic==

The fundamental difference between modern formal logic and traditional, or Aristotelian logic, lies in their differing analysis of the logical form of the sentences they treat:  
*On the traditional view, the form of the sentence consists of (1) a subject (e.g., "man") plus a sign of quantity ("all" or "some" or "no"); (2) the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], which is of the form "is" or "is not"; (3) a predicate (e.g., "mortal"). Thus: 'all men are mortal'. The logical constants such as "all", "no" and so on, plus sentential connectives such as "and" and "or" were called [[syncategorematic]] terms (from the Greek ''kategorei'' – to predicate, and ''syn'' – together with). This is a fixed scheme, where each judgment has a specific quantity and copula, determining the logical form of the sentence. 
*The modern view is more complex, since a single judgement of Aristotle's system involves two or more logical connectives. For example, the sentence "All men are mortal" involves, in term logic, two non-logical terms "is a man" (here ''M'') and "is mortal" (here ''D''): the sentence is given by the judgement ''A(M,D)''. In [[predicate logic]], the sentence involves the same two non-logical concepts, here analyzed as &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the sentence is given by &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (m(x) \rightarrow d(x))&lt;/math&gt;, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]]. 

The more complex modern view comes with more power. On the modern view, the fundamental form of a simple sentence is given by a recursive schema, like natural language and involving [[logical connective]]s, which are joined by juxtaposition to other sentences, which in turn may have logical structure. Medieval logicians recognized the [[problem of multiple generality]], where Aristotelian logic is unable to satisfactorily render such sentences as "Some guys have all the luck", because both quantities "all" and "some" may be relevant in an inference, but the fixed scheme that Aristotle used allows only one to govern the inference. Just as linguists recognize recursive structure in natural languages, it appears that logic needs recursive structure.

In [[linguistics]], '''mama''' and '''papa''' are considered a special case of [[false cognate]]s.  In many [[language]]s of the world, sequences of sounds similar to {{IPA|/mama/}} and {{IPA|/papa/}} mean "[[mother]]" and "[[father]]", usually but not always in that order.  This is thought to be a coincidence resulting from the process of early  [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name="Jakobson"&gt;[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson, R.]] (1962) [https://archive.org/stream/selectedwritings01jako#page/538/mode/2up "Why 'mama' and 'papa'?"] In Jakobson, R. ''Selected Writings, Vol. I: Phonological Studies'', pp. 538–545. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;[[Johanna Nichols|Nichols, J.]] (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tBsd89VO4HsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA253 "Why 'me' and 'thee'?"] ''Historical Linguistics 1999: Selected Papers from the 14th International Conference on Historical Linguistics'', Vancouver, 9–13 August 1999,  ed. Laurel J. Brinton, John Benjamins Publishing, 2001, pages 253-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancel"&gt;Bancel, P.J. and A.M. de l'Etang.

Cohen (John Benjamins Publishing, Nov 15, 2013), pages 333-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

These terms use speech sounds that are among the easiest to produce: bilabials like {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, and {{IPA|/b/}}, and the open vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.  They are, therefore, often among the first word-like sounds made by [[babbling]] babies ('''babble words'''), and parents tend to associate the first sound babies make with themselves and to employ them subsequently as part of their [[Baby talk|baby-talk]] lexicon. Thus, there is no need to ascribe to common ancestry the similarities of [[!Kung language|!Kung]] ''ba'', [[Aramaic]] ''abba'', [[Mandarin Chinese]] ''bàba'', and [[Persian language|Persian]] ''baba'' (all "father"); or [[Navajo language|Navajo]] ''amá'', [[Mandarin Chinese]] ''māma'', [[Swahili language|Swahili]] ''mama'', [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''mama'', and [[Polish language|Polish]] ''mama'' (all "mother").  For the same reason, some scientists believe that 'mama' and 'papa' were among the first words that humans spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gosline|first1=Anna|title=Family words came first for early humans|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6188-family-words-came-first-for-early-humans.html#.VXqzvvntlBc|publisher=NEW SCIENTIST|date=26 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, there is nothing of motherhood or fatherhood inherent in the sounds.

Variants using other sounds do occur: for example, in Fijian, the word for "mother" is ''nana'', the  Turkish word is ''ana'', and in [[Old Japanese]], the word for "mother" was ''papa''. The modern Japanese word for "father," ''chichi'', is from older ''titi''.  Very few languages lack labial consonants (this mostly being attested on a family basis, in the [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] and some of the [[Athabaskan languages]]), and only [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]] is known to lack an open vowel /a/. The Tagalog ''-na-'' / ''-ta-'' ("mom" / "dad" words) parallel the more common ''ma'' / ''pa'' in nasality / orality of the consonants and identity of place of articulation.  

The linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] hypothesized that the nasal sound in "mama" comes from the nasal murmur that babies produce when breastfeeding:

{{Quote|text=Often the sucking activities of a child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation which can be produced when the lips are pressed to mother’s breast or to the feeding bottle and the mouth full. Later, this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish. When the mouth is free from nutrition, the nasal murmur may be supplied with an oral, particularly labial release; it may also obtain an optional vocalic support. |author=Roman Jakobson |source=Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'?}}

*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], mother is called ''Emak'' (''mak'') or ''Ibu'' (''buk''), father is called ''Bapak'' or ''Ayah''. The modern Indonesian word for "Father", was (Papi) &amp; "Mother", was (Mami).the word "Mami &amp; Papi" has been used since the days of the Dutch Indies Colonial, causing the mixing of the words "Papa &amp; Mama", Europe to "Papi &amp; Mami", Indonesia.

===Constructed languages===
*[[Esperanto]]: ''Panjo'' / ''Paĉjo''
*[[lojban]]: ''patfu'' is father/ ''mamta'' is mother

===Dravidian languages ===

* Though ''amma'' and ''nana'' are used in [[Tulu language|Tulu]], they are not really Tulu words but used due to the influence of neighboring states' languages. The actual words for ''mother'' in Tulu is ''nane'' pronounced {{IPA-all|nane}} and the word for ''father'' in Tulu is ''amme'' pronounced {{IPA-all|amæ}}. Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages (similar to [[Georgian language|Georgian]] in that sense).
* In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], "''Thalli''" and "''Thandri''" are used for mother and father in formal Telugu. ''Tata'' and ''nana or pa'' are used for mother and father for the informal way. Notice how ''nana'' refers to ''maternal grandfather'' in Hindi, and how that differs from its Telugu meaning. "''Nayana''" is also used for father in informal Telugu in the [[Rayalaseema]] region of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] of India. Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages (similar to [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] in that sense).
* In [[Malayalam]], the word for mother is  "''Amma''" and for father is "''Achan''". In scholastic usage, ''Mathav'' and ''Pithav'' are used respectively. "''Achan''" is a transformed Malayalam equivalent of the Sanskrit "''Arya''" for "Sir/Master" (''Arya'' - ''ajja'' -&gt; ''ayya)''. Other words like "''Appan''", "'Bappa'" etc. are also used for father, and words such as "''Umma''", "''Ammachi''" for mother.
* In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], "''Thaai''" and "''Thanthai''" are the formal Tamil words for mother and father; informally ''Amma'' and ''Appa'' are much more common words for mother and father respectively.
*In the [[Kannada]] language, "''Thaayi''" for mother and "''Thande''" for father are used formally. But to address them informally Kannadigas use ''amma'' for mother and ''appa'' for father.

===Uralic languages===
* [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''ema''
* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''apa'' means "father" and ''anya'' means mother, which tends to use open vowels such as {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. For formal usage, these words are applied, but both ''mama'' and ''papa'' are used as well, in informal speech. For family internal addressing, ''apu'' and ''anyu'' (variants of "apa" and "anya," respectively) are also used.
* [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''emä'' (note: The use of "emä" is considered archaic in the meaning "mother of a child". The modern word is "äiti" derived from Gothic "aiþei".)

===Indo-European languages===
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]  nena/nëna / mama
* [[Assamese language|Assamese]] has ''ma'' and ''aai'' as "mother" and ''deuta'' and ''pitai'' as "father". However due to English borrowings, the words ''mamma'' and ''pappa'' are sometimes used today.

In popular speech ''tata'' and ''tyatya'' for "dad" were also used until the 20th century.
* [[Serbian language|Serbian]] мама / ''mama''
* [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]], the word for mother originally was "''abbe''" ("''abbiyande''") and father was "''appa ''" ("''appanande''"). Use of "''amma''" for mother and "''nana''" for father is due to heavy influence of [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. In some areas of Sri Lanka, particularly in the [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|Central Province]], Sinhalese use the word "''nanachhi''" for father.

===Kartvelian languages ===
* [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is notable for having its similar words "backwards" compared to other languages: "father" in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] is მამა (''mama''), while "mother" is pronounced as დედა (''deda''). პაპა ''papa'' stands for "grandfather".
===Language isolates===
*[[Basque language|Basque]]: ''ama'' for mother and ''aita'' for father.
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]], 父 (''chichi'') and 母 (''haha'') are for "father" and "mother" respectively. They are the basic words which do not combine with [[Japanese honorifics|honorific]]s ''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;papa'' (modern Japanese {{IPA|/h/}} derives from the [[Voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}}) which in turn is from the older *[[p]].) Japanese has also borrowed informal ''mama'' and ''papa'' along with the native terms.
*[[Korean language|Korean]], 엄마 (eom-ma) and 아빠 (a-bba) are mom and dad in informal language, whereas the formal words are 아버지 (a-beo-ji) and 어머니 (eo-meo-ni) for father and mother. Korean is usually considered a language isolate with no living relatives, but some authorities differ.
*[[Kutenai language|Kutenai]], a [[language isolate]] of southeastern [[British Columbia]], uses the word ''Ma.''
*[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: 𒀀𒈠 / ''ama''

*[[Burmese language|Burmese]], {{my|မိခင်}} (''mi khin'') and {{my|ဖခင်}} (''pha khin'') are the words for "mother" and "father" respectively. However, parents are usually referred to by their children as {{my|မေမေ}} (''may may'') and {{my|ဖေဖေ}} (''phay phay'') — "Mom" and "Dad."
* [[Mandarin Chinese]], 父親 (''fùqīn'') and 母親 (''mǔqīn'') are for "father" and "mother" respectively. However, parents are usually referred to by their children as 爸爸 (''bàba'') and 媽媽 (''māma'') — "Dad" and "Mom". And sometimes in informal language, they use ''bà'' and mā for short. (Note: The ''f'' sound was pronounced bilabially (as with p or b) in older and some other forms of Chinese, thus ''fu'' is related to the common "father" word ''pa''.)
*[[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] uses ''amma'' for mother and ''nana'' for father.

===Tai-Kadai languages===
* [[Thai language|Thai]], "mother" is mê(แม่{{IPA-th|mɛ̂ː|}}) and "father" is phô(พ่อ{{IPA-th|pʰɔ̂ː|}}). Má(มะ๊{{IPA-th|mɑ|}}) and ba(บะ{{IPA-th|ba|}}) or cha(ฉะ{{IPA-th|tʃa|}}) respectively in Southern Thai.

===Turkic languages===
* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], both ''anne'' and ''ana'' mean mother, and ''baba'' means father.
* [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Central Asia]]n [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, uses ''ana'' or ''apa'' for mother, and ''ata'' for father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">A '''Martian scientist''' or '''Martian researcher''' is a hypothetical [[Martian]] frequently used in [[thought experiment]]s as an outside observer of conditions on [[Earth]]. The most common variety is the '''Martian [[anthropology|anthropologist]]''', but Martians researching subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]] and [[biology]] have also been invoked.

The following extract from an essay by [[Richard Dawkins]] is more or less typical.
:''A Martian [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] who didn't know that all human [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] happily interbreed with one another, and didn't know that most of the underlying [[genetics|genetic]] variance in our [[species]] is shared by all races might be tempted by our regional differences in skin colour, facial features, hair, body size and proportions to split us into more than one species.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins R]]. ''A Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays''. Phoenix, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; 2003. {{ISBN|0-297-82973-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[linguistics]], the Martian approach is recommended for [[Descriptive linguistics|language description]]:
:''The descriptive analyst must be guided by certain very fixed [[principle]]s if he is to be [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] in describing accurately any [[language]] or part of any language. It would be excellent if he could adopt a completely man-from-Mars attitude toward any language he analyzes and describes.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Nida|Nida E]]. ''Morphology: the descriptive analysis of words''. 2nd ed. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; 1949. p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical Martian anthropologist is described in the writings of [[Noam Chomsky]] as one who, upon studying the world's languages, would conclude that they are all dialects of a single language embodying a "[[universal grammar]]" reflecting a hardwired, genetically determined linguistic module inherent in the human brain.

In [[philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of language]] and [[philosophy of mind]], the Martian is often invoked as an example of an intelligent being with a cognitive apparatus that differs from that of humans, e.g. the following example given by [[Saul Kripke]]:

:''I will not here argue that simplicity is relative, or that it is hard to define, or that a Martian might find the quus function simpler than the plus function.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke|Kripke, Saul]].  ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language: An Elementary Exposition'', Harvard University Press. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In a common [[rhetoric]]al turn, invoking the Martian scientist forces the reader to observe an obvious state of affairs that is ordinarily overlooked:
:''If a Martian graced our planet, it would be struck by one remarkable similarity among Earth's living creatures and a key difference.''&lt;ref&gt;Hauser MD, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky N]], Fitch WT. The Faculty of Language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? ''Science''. 2002;298(5598):1569-79. {{DOI|10.1126/science.298.5598.1569}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(NB: The similarity Chomsky et al. mean is the universal hereditary language of DNA, while the difference is the lack of a universal language of communication.)

{{Semiotics}}

In [[semiotics]], the '''meaning''' of a sign is its place in a [[sign relation]], in other words, the set of roles that it occupies within a given sign relation.  

This statement holds whether ''sign'' is taken to mean a ''sign type'' or a ''sign token''.  Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses.

Two aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the ''connotative relation'' and the ''denotative relation''.  The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs.  The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the ''signified'' and the ''signifier.''
For example, a US salesperson doing business in [[Etiquette in Japan|Japan]] might interpret [[silence]] following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics

==Triadic relation==
The triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components:

1.The representamen, which is the medium, or ‘sign vehicle’,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2013|title = Peirce's Theory of Signs|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/peirce-semiotics/|date = 2013-01-01|first = Albert|last = Atkin|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Semiotics: The Basics|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|isbn = 0-415-35111-1|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

3. The object, or that to which the sign refers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Together, these three components generate [[semiosis]]. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers.
While it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself.

The representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire.

The triadic model of the sign was proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]. In contradistinction to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‘representamen’ and ‘interpretant’ components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure’s dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''mission statement''' is a short statement of an [[organization]]'s purpose, identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary customers or [[Market (economics)|market]], and its geographical region of operation.&lt;ref name=Entrepreneur/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; It may include a short statement of such fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies, a business's main competitive advantages, or a desired future state—the "vision".&lt;ref name=Entrepreneur/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

A mission  is not simply a description of an organization by an external party, but an expression, made by its leaders, of their desires and intent for the organization. The purpose of a mission statement is to focus and direct the organization itself. It communicates primarily to the people who make up the organization—its members or employees—giving them a shared understanding of the organization's intended direction. Organizations normally do not change their mission statements over time, since they define their continuous, ongoing purpose and focus.&lt;ref name=BusinessDict/&gt;

According to [[Chris Bart]], professor of strategy and governance at [[McMaster University]],&lt;ref name=Bromides/&gt; a commercial mission statement consists of three essential components:&lt;ref name=SexLies/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

# [[Key market]]: the target audience
# Contribution: the product or service
# Distinction: what makes the product unique or why the audience should buy it over another

Bart estimates that in practice, only about ten percent of mission statements say something meaningful.&lt;ref name=Bromides/&gt; For this reason, they are widely regarded with contempt.&lt;ref name=SexLies/&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{or-section|date=January 2018}}
The sole purpose of a mission statement is to serve as a company's goal/agenda, it outlines clearly what the [[goal]] of the company is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Post |first=Jennifer |date=3 May 2017 |title = What is a Mission Statement?|url = http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3783-mission-statement.html|website = Business News Daily|publisher=Purch|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some generic examples of mission statements would be, "To provide the best service possible within the banking sector for our customers." or "To provide the best experience for all of our customers." The reason why businesses make use of mission statements is to make it clear what they look to achieve as an organization, not only to themselves and their employees but to the customers and other people who are a part of the business, such as [[shareholder]]s. As a company evolves, so will their mission statement. This is to make sure that the company remains on track and to ensure that the mission statement does not lose its touch and become boring or stale.

It is important that a mission statement is not confused with a [[vision statement]]. As discussed earlier, the main purpose of a mission statement is to get across the ambitions of an [[Organization|organisation]] in a short and simple fashion, it is not necessary to go into detail for the mission statement which is evident in examples given. The reason why it is important that a mission statement and vision statement are not confused is because they both serve different purposes. Vision statements tend to be more related to strategic planning and lean more towards discussing where a company aims to be in the future.

== Advantages ==
'''Provides direction:''' Mission statements are a way to direct a business into the right path. They play a part in helping the business make better decisions which can be beneficial to them. Without the mission statement providing direction, businesses may struggle when it comes to making decisions and planning for the future. This is why providing direction could be considered one of the most advantageous points of a mission statement.

'''Clear purpose:''' Having a clear purpose can remove any potential ambiguities that can surround the existence of a business. People who are interested in the progression of the business, such as [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s, will want to know that the business is making the right choices and progressing more towards achieving their goals, which will help to remove any doubt the stakeholders may have in the business.

A mission statement can act as a motivational tool within an organisation, and it can allow employees to all work towards one common goal that benefits both the organisation and themselves. This can help with factors such as [[Job satisfaction|employee satisfaction]] and productivity. It is important that employees feel a sense of purpose. Giving them this sense of purpose will allow them to focus more on their daily tasks and help them to realise the goals of the organisation and their role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benefits of Vision and Mission Statements |url = http://clearlogic.ca/benefits-of-vision-and-mission-statements/|website =Clearlogic Consulting Professionals |date=2013 |accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Roger |last=Vozar |date=1 June 2013 |title = How organizations benefit from having a clearly defined mission |url = http://www.sbnonline.com/article/how-organizations-benefit-from-having-a-clearly-defined-mission/|website = Smart Business Magazine|publisher=Smart Business Network Inc. |accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Although it is mostly beneficial for a business to craft a good mission statement, there are some situations where a mission statement can be considered pointless or not useful to a business.

'''Unrealistic:''' In most cases, mission statements turn out to be unrealistic and far too optimistic. An unrealistic mission statement can also affect the performance and [[morale]] of the employees within the workplace. This is because an unrealistic mission statement would reduce the likelihood of employees being able to meet this standard which could demotivate [[employees]] in the long term. Unrealistic mission statements also serve no purpose and can be considered a waste of management's time. Another issue which could arise from an unrealistic mission statement is that poor decisions could be made in an attempt to achieve this goal which has the potential to harm the business and be seen as a waste of both time and resources.

'''Waste of time and resources:''' Mission statements require planning. This takes time and effort for those who are responsible for creating the mission statement. If the mission statement is not achieved, then the process of creating the mission statement could be seen as a waste of time for all of the people involved. A lot of thought and time can be spent in designing a good mission statement, and to have all of that time wasted is not what businesses can afford. The wasted time could have been spent on much more important tasks within the organisation such as [[decision-making]] for the [[business]].

== Design ==
According to an independent contributor to [[Forbes]], the following questions must be answered in the mission statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Patrick |last=Hull |date=10 January 2013 |title = Answer 4 Questions to Get a Great Mission Statement|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickhull/2013/01/10/answer-4-questions-to-get-a-great-mission-statement/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-02|publisher=Forbes Media, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “What do we do?” — The mission statement should clearly outline the main purpose of the organisation, and what they do.
* “How do we do it?” — It should also mention how one plans on achieving the mission statement.
* “Whom do we do it for?” — The audience of the mission statement should be clearly stated within the mission statement.
* “What value are we bringing?” — The benefits and values of the mission statement should be clearly outlined.

When designing a mission statement, it should be very clear to the audience what the purpose of it is. It is ideal for a business to be able to communicate their mission, goals and objectives to the reader without including any unnecessary information through the mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 October 2003 |title=How to Write Your Mission Statement |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/65230 |website=Entrepreneur |publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc. |accessdate=2015-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FEMA - 44805 - FEMA Mission Statement posted at a Joint Field Office in TN.jpg|thumb|US [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s Mission Statement Poster]]
[[Richard Branson]] has commented on ways of crafting a good mission statement; he explains the importance of having a mission statement that is clear and straight to the point and does not contain unnecessary baffling. He went on to analyse a mission statement, using [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]]'s mission statement at the time (2013) as an example. In his evaluation of the mission statement, he seemed to suggest that while the statement sounded interesting, most people would not be able to understand the message it is putting across. In other words the message of the mission statement potentially meant nothing to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Richard |last=Branson |author-link=Richard Branson |date=22 July 2013 |title = Richard Branson on Crafting Your Mission Statement|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227507|website = Entrepreneur|publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc.|accessdate = 2015-11-02|dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023071226/https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/227507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|This further backs up the idea that a good mission statement is one that is clear and answers the right questions in a simple manner, and does not over complicate things. An example of a good mission statement would be Google's, which is "to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Andrew |last=Thompson|date=20 August 2015 |title = Google's Vision Statement &amp; Mission Statement|url = http://panmore.com/google-vision-statement-mission-statement|website = Panmore Institute|accessdate = 2015-11-02 |dead-url=no |archive-date=13 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113110528/http://panmore.com/google-vision-statement-mission-statement }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in source|date=April 2017}}}}

'''Resolution IV.4.422-4224''', commonly referred to as the '''Montevideo Resolution''', is a resolution passed in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] on December 10, 1954 by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]]. The resolution officially supports the [[constructed language]] [[Esperanto]] as an [[international auxiliary language]] and recommends that the [[Director-general|Director-General of UNESCO]] follow current developments in the use of the language. The Montevideo Resolution was the result of a long campaign by [[Ivo Lapenna]].

In 1977, the Director-General visited the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], and in 1985, UNESCO passed a further resolution recommending that member countries encourage the teaching of Esperanto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48218">In [[linguistics]], '''mutual intelligibility''' is a relationship between [[language]]s or [[dialect]]s in which speakers of different but related [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is sometimes used as an important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] factors are often also used.

Intelligibility between languages can be asymmetric, with speakers of one understanding more of the other than speakers of the other understanding the first. When it is relatively symmetric, it is characterized as "mutual". It exists in differing degrees among many related or geographically proximate languages of the world, often in the context of a [[dialect continuum]].

[[Linguistic distance]] is the name for the concept of calculating a measurement for how different languages are from one another. The higher the linguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility. One common metric used is the [[Levenshtein distance]].

==Intelligibility==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}

For individuals to achieve moderate proficiency or understanding in a language (called L2) other than their [[first language]] (L1) typically requires considerable time and effort through study and/or [[Practice (learning method)|practical application]]. However, many groups of languages are partly mutually intelligible, i.e. most speakers of one language find it relatively easy to achieve some degree of understanding in the related language(s). Often the languages are [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]], and they are likely to be similar to each other in [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], [[pronunciation]], or other features.

Intelligibility among languages can vary between individuals or groups within a language population according to their knowledge of various registers and vocabulary in their own language, their exposure to additional related languages, their interest in or familiarity with other cultures, the domain of discussion, [[psychology|psycho]]-[[cognition|cognitive]] traits, the mode of language used (written vs. oral), and other factors.

==Mutually intelligible languages or varieties of one language==
There is no formal distinction between two distinct languages and two [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of a single language, but some linguists use mutual intelligibility as one of the primary factors in deciding between the two cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009 |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=132–136 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

Some linguists&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. P.H. Matthews, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics'', OUP 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that mutual intelligibility is, ideally at least, the primary criterion separating languages from dialects. On the other hand, speakers of closely related languages can often communicate with each other; thus there are varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, and often other criteria are also used. As an example, in the case of a linear [[dialect continuum]] that shades gradually between varieties, where speakers near the center can understand the varieties at both ends, but speakers at one end cannot understand the speakers at the other end, the entire chain is often considered a single language. If the central varieties then die out and only the varieties at both ends survive, they may then be reclassified as two languages, even though no actual language change has occurred.

In addition, political and social conventions often override considerations of mutual intelligibility. For example, the [[varieties of Chinese]] are often considered a single language even though there is usually no mutual intelligibility between geographically separated varieties. Another similar example would be [[varieties of Arabic]]. In contrast, there is often significant intelligibility between different [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], but as each of them has its own standard form, they are classified as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0-521-59646-6
  | pages = 3–4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant intelligibility between [[Thai languages]] of different regions of Thailand.

To deal with the conflict in cases such as [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]], Chinese and [[German dialects|German]], the term ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|Dachsprache]]'' (a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] "umbrella language") is sometimes seen: Chinese and German are languages in the sociolinguistic sense even though some speakers cannot understand each other without recourse to a standard or prestige form.&lt;!--"Macrolanguage" is jargon specific to ''Ethnologue''; it is not a normal linguistic term, and it is unreliable because it is inconsistently applied by the ''Ethnologue''.--&gt;

==Asymmetric intelligibility==
Asymmetric intelligibility refers to two languages that are considered partially mutually intelligible, but where one group of speakers has more difficulty understanding the other language than the other way around. There can be various reasons for this. If, for example, one language is related to another but has simplified its grammar, the speakers of the original language may understand the simplified language, but less vice versa. For example, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers tend to find it easier to understand [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] than vice versa as a result of Afrikaans's simplified grammar&lt;ref name="gooskens"/&gt;.

Perhaps the most common reason for apparent asymmetric intelligibility is that speakers of one variety have more exposure to the other than vice versa. For example, speakers of [[Scottish English]] have frequent exposure to standard [[American English]] through movies and TV programs, whereas speakers of American English have little exposure to Scottish English; hence, American English speakers often find it difficult to understand Scottish English or, especially, [[Scots language|Scots]] (which differs significantly from standard Scottish English), whereas Scots tend to have few problems understanding standard American English.

Northern Germanic languages spoken in Scandinavia form a [[dialect continuum]] where two furthermost dialects have almost no mutual intelligibility. As such, spoken Danish and Swedish normally have low mutual intelligibility,&lt;ref name="gooskens"/&gt; but Swedes in the [[Öresund]] region (including [[Malmö]] and [[Helsingborg]]), across a strait from the Danish capital [[Copenhagen]], understand Danish somewhat better, largely due to the proximity of the region to Danish-speaking areas (see [[North Germanic languages#Mutual intelligibility|''Mutual intelligibility in North Germanic languages'']]). While Norway was under [[Denmark–Norway|Danish rule]], the [[Bokmål]] written standard of Norwegian originates from [[Dano-Norwegian]], a [[koiné]] that evolved among the urban elite in Norwegian cities during the later years of the union. Additionally, Norwegian assimilated a considerable amount of Danish vocabulary as well as traditional Danish expressions.&lt;ref name="gooskens"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_JMMD_2007.pdf |title=The Contribution of Linguistic Factors to the Intelligibility of Closely Related Languages |first=Charlotte|last=Gooskens |journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=28|issue=6|year=2007 |accessdate=2010-05-19|doi=10.2167/jmmd511.0|page=445|citeseerx=10.1.1.414.7645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, spoken mutual intelligibility is not reciprocal.&lt;ref name=gooskens/&gt;

Similarly, in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], standard German or Italian speakers may have great difficulty understanding the "dialects" from regions other than their own, but virtually all "dialect" speakers learn the standard languages in school and from the media.

** The non-standard vernacular dialects of Serbo-Croatian ([[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]], [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] and [[Torlakian dialect|Torlakian]]) are considered by some linguists to be separate, albeit closely related languages to Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian), rather than its dialects, as Shtokavian has its own [[Shtokavian#Classification|set of subdialects]]. Their mutual intelligibility varies greatly, both between the dialects themselves as well as with other languages. Kajkavian has higher mutual intelligibility with [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] than the national varieties of Shtokavian, while Chakavian has a low mutual intelligibility with either, in part due to large number of loanwords from [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. Torlakian (considered a subdialect of Serbian Old Shtokavian by some) has a significant level of mutual intelligibility with [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].&lt;ref name=Bul20&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7-Bees_VvAC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=%D0%97%D0%B0+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D1%80%D1%8A%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81+%D0%BE%D1%82+18+%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA,+%D0%B2:+%D0%91%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%82+%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BA+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7+%D0%A5%D0%A5+%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Българският език през ХХ век|first=Василка|last=Радева|date=15 July 2018|publisher=Pensoft Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9789546421135}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[South Slavic languages]] in effect form a large [[dialect continuum]] of gradually mutually intelligible varieties depending on distance between the areas where they are spoken.

There have been many accounts of the '''[[origin of language]]''' in the world's '''[[mythology|mythologies]]''' and other stories pertaining to the origin of language, the development of language and the reasons behind the diversity in languages today.

These myths have similarities, recurring themes, and differences, having been passed down through [[oral tradition]]. Some myths go further than just storytelling and are religious, with some even having a literal interpretation even today. Recurring themes in the myths of language dispersal are floods and catastrophes. Many stories tell of a great [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] or flood which caused the peoples of the Earth to scatter over the face of the planet. Punishment by a god or gods for perceived wrongdoing on the part of man is another recurring theme.

Myths regarding the origins of language and languages are generally subsumed or footnoted into larger [[creation myth]]s, although there are differences. Some tales say a [[Creator deity|creator]] endowed language from the beginning, others count language among later gifts, or curses.

==Hebrew Bible==
{{main|Adamic language|Tower of Babel#Confusion of tongues}}
{{further|Tower of Babel}}
[[File:Confusion of Tongues.png|right|thumb|The "[[confusion of tongues]]" by [[Gustave Doré]], a [[woodcut]] depicting the [[Tower of Babel]] from [[Abrahamic]] myth.]]
The [[Hebrew Bible]] attributes the origin of language per se to humans, with Adam being asked to name the creatures that God had created.

One of the most well known examples in the West is the [[Tower of Babel]] passage from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. 
It tells of [[YHWH|God]] punishing [[Human beings|humanity]] for arrogance and disobedience by means of the [[confusion of tongues]].

:And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
:Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  (Genesis 11:5-6, [[KJV]] translation)

This became the standard account in the European Middle Ages, reflected in medieval literature such as the tale of [[Fénius Farsaid]].

==India==
[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As ''[[brahman]]'' "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s".
She is presented as the consort of [[Prajapati]], who is likewise presented as the origin of the Veda.&lt;ref&gt;"Veda, Prajāpati and Vāc" in Barbara A. Holdrege, 'Veda in the Brahmanas', in: Laurie L. Patton (ed.) ''Authority, anxiety, and canon: essays in Vedic interpretation'', 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1937-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She became conflated with [[Sarasvati]] in later Hindu mythology.

==Americas==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|right|Doré's "The Deluge". Man and beast take refuge on an isolated rock during the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], a feature of [[creation myth]]s from around the world.]]
In common with the mythology of many other civilizations and cultures which tell of a [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes tell of a deluge which came over the Earth. After the water subsides, various explanations are given for the new diversity in speech.

===Mesoamerica===
The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survive, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begot many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]] were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
A similar flood is described by the [[Kaska]] people from North America, however, like with the story of Babel, the people were now "widely scattered over the world". The narrator of the story adds that this explains the many different centres of population, the many tribes and the many languages, "Before the flood, there was but one centre; for all the people lived together in one country, and spoke one language."&lt;ref&gt;Teit, J. A. (1917) "Kaska Tales" in ''Journal of American Folklore'', No. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

:They did not know where the other people lived, and probably thought themselves the only survivors. Long afterwards, when in their wanderings they met people from another place, they spoke different languages, and could not understand one another.

An [[Iroquois]] story tells of the god [[Taryenyawagon]] (''Holder of the Heavens'') guiding his people on a journey and directing them to settle in different places whence their languages changed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E. [http://www.library.jbsheets.com/america/LegendsTraditionsandLawsoftheIroquois.htm Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of the Tuscarora Indians] (Access date: 4 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Salishan]] myth tells how an argument led to the divergence of languages.  Two people were arguing whether the high-pitched humming noise that accompanies ducks in flight is from air passing through the beak or from the flapping of wings.  The argument is not settled by the chief, who then calls a council of all the leading people from nearby villages.  This council breaks down in argument when nobody can agree, and eventually the dispute leads to a split where some people move far away.  Over time they slowly began to speak differently, and eventually other languages were formed.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, F. (ed.) (1917) "The Origin of the Different Languages". ''Folk-Tales of Salishan and Sahaptin Tribes'' (New York: American Folk-Lore Society)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of the [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]], [[indigenous people of California]], a creator, accompanied by [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] creates language as he creates the tribes in various localities. He lays sticks which will transform into people upon daybreak.

:Then follows a long journey of the creator, still accompanied by Coyote, in the course of which he makes tribes in different localities, in each case by laying sticks in the house over night, gives them their customs and mode of life, and each their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, A. L. (1907) "Indian Myths of South Central California" in ''American Archaeology and Ethnology'', Vol. 4, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazonas, Brazil===
The [[Ticuna people]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Upper Amazon]] tell that all the peoples were once a single tribe, speaking the same language until two hummingbird eggs were eaten, it is not told by whom. Subsequently the tribe split into groups and dispersed far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro, R. (2000) "Origin Myths" in ''California Journal of Science Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

In [[Ancient Greece]] there was a myth which told that for ages men had lived without law under the rule of [[Zeus]] and speaking one language, gifted to them by the god and goddess of ingenuity, Philarios and Philarion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966398472|title=Multilingualism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Maher, John C.,|isbn=9780198724995|edition= First |location=Oxford|oclc=966398472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Hermes]] brought diversity in speech and along with it separation into nations and discord ensued. Zeus then resigned his position, yielding it to the first king of men, [[Phoroneus]].

In [[Norse mythology]], the faculty of speech is a gift from the third son of [[Borr]], [[Vé]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vili and Vé]]&lt;/ref&gt; who gave also hearing and sight.

:When the sons of [[Borr]] were walking along the sea-strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight.

==Africa==
The Wa-Sania, a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people of [[East Africa]]n origin have a tale that in the beginning, the peoples of the earth knew only one language, but during a severe [[famine]], a madness struck the people, causing them to wander in all directions, jabbering strange words, and this is how different languages came about.

A god who speaks all languages is a theme in [[African mythology]], two examples being [[Eshu]] of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], a trickster who is a messenger of the gods. Eshu has a parallel in [[Legba]] from the Fon people of [[Benin]]. Another [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] god who speaks all the languages of the world is [[Orunmila]], the god of [[divination]].

==Southeast Asia and Oceania==

===Polynesia===
A group of people on the island of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]] in [[Polynesia]] tell a very similar story to the Tower of Babel, speaking of a God who, "in anger chased the builders away, broke down the building, and changed their language, so that they spoke diverse tongues".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, R. W. (1933) ''Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia'' (Cambridge), vol. I, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[South Australia]], a people of [[Encounter Bay]] tell a story of how diversity in language came about from [[cannibalism]]:

:In remote time an old woman, named Wurruri lived towards the east and generally walked with a large stick in her hand, to scatter the fires around which others were sleeping, Wurruri at length died. Greatly delighted at this circumstance, they sent messengers in all directions to give notice of her death; men, women and children came, not to lament, but to show their joy. The Raminjerar were the first who fell upon the corpse and began eating the flesh, and immediately began to speak intelligibly. The other tribes to the eastward arriving later, ate the contents of the intestines, which caused them to speak a language slightly different. The northern tribes came last and devoured the intestines and all that remained, and immediately spoke a language differing still more from that of the Raminjerar.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, H. E. A., (1879) "Manners and Customs of the Aborigines of the Encounter Bay Tribe", published in Wood, D., et al., ''The Native Tribes of South Australia'', (Adelaide: E.S. Wigg &amp; Son) (available online [http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//SAhistory/Meyer.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of [[Australian Aboriginal]] people, the [[Gunwinggu]], tell of a goddess in [[dreamtime]] giving each of her children a language of their own to play with.

===Andaman Islands===
The traditional beliefs of the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] describe language as being given by the god [[Pūluga]] to the first man and woman at their union following a great deluge. The language given was called ''bojig-yâb-'', which is the language spoken to this day, according to their belief, by the tribe inhabiting the south and south-eastern portion of middle [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. This language is described by the inhabitants as the "mother tongue" from which all other dialects have been made.

Their beliefs hold that even before the death of the first man,

:... his offspring became so numerous that their home could no longer accommodate them. At Pūluga's bidding they were furnished with all necessary weapons, implements, and fire, and then scattered in pairs all over the country. When this exodus occurred Puluga- provided each party with a distinct dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Man, E. H. (1883) "On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands. (Part II.)" in ''The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 12, pp. 117–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus explaining the diversity of language.

In [[health informatics]], a '''national minimum dataset''' is a [[database]] of health encounters held by a central [[Information repository|repository]].

"Minimum" implies that the data fields will be only those required to aggregate information for the purposes of administering the health system in the particular country and for reporting information required as a member country of [[WHO]].

The '''origin of speech''' refers to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]] in the context of the physiological
development of the human [[speech organs]] such as the   [[tongue]], [[lip]]s and [[Place of articulation|vocal organs]] used to produce [[Phoneme|phonological units]] in [[human universal|all human languages]].

==Background==
Although related to the more general problem of the [[origin of language]], the [[evolution]] of distinctively human [[speech]] capacities has become a distinct and in many ways separate area of scientific research.&lt;ref name="Hockett 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F. | author1link = Charles F.

Speech is in this sense optional, although it is the default modality for language.[[Image:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|250px|Places of articulation (passive and active):&lt;br /&gt;1.

Uncontroversially, monkeys, apes and humans, like many other animals, have evolved specialised mechanisms for producing ''sound'' for purposes of social communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kelemen, G. (1963). Comparative anatomy and performance of the vocal organ in vertebrates. In R. Busnel (ed.), ''Acoustic behavior of animals.'' Amsterdam:  Elsevier, pp. 489–521.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its ''tongue'' for such purposes.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Riede | first1 = T. | last2 = Bronson | first2 = E. | last3 = Hatzikirou | first3 = H. | last4 = Zuberbühler | first4 = K. | title = Vocal production mechanisms in a non-human primate: morphological data and a model. | journal = [[J Hum Evol]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–96 |date=Jan 2005 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.10.002 | PMID = 15656937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Riede|first1=T.| last2=Bronson|first2=E.|last3=Hatzikirou |first3=H.| last4=Zuberbühler| first4=K.|title=Multiple discontinuities in nonhuman vocal tracts&amp;nbsp;— A reply|journal=Journal of Human Evolution| volume=50| issue=2|year=2006| pages=222–225|url=https://www.academia.edu/335565/Multiple_discontinuities_in_nonhuman_vocal_tracts_-_A_response_to_Lieberman|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our species' unprecedented use of the tongue, lips and other moveable parts seems to place speech in a quite separate category, making its evolutionary emergence an intriguing theoretical challenge in the eyes of many scholars.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000" /&gt;

==Modality-independence==
[[Image:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[angular gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[supramarginal gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green and the [[auditory cortex|primary auditory cortex]] is represented in pink.]]
The term ''[[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]'' means the chosen representational format for encoding and transmitting information. A striking feature of language is that it is ''modality-independent.'' Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its innate capacity to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, W. C. 1960. ''Sign language structure: an outline of the communicative systems of the American deaf.'' Silver Spring, MD: Linstock Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellugi, U. and E. S. Klima 1975. Aspects of sign language and its structure. In J. F. Kavanagh and J. E. Cutting (eds), ''The Role of Speech in Language.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, pp. 171 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Bellugi | first2 = U. | last3 = Klima | first3 = ES. | title = The neurobiology of sign language and its implications for the neural basis of language. | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = 6584 | pages = 699–702 |date=Jun 1996 | doi = 10.1038/381699a0 | pmid = 8649515 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kegl 1999"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Kegl| first1 = Judy | last2 = Senghas| first2 = Ann | last3 = Coppola| first3 = Marie | title = Creation through Contact: Sign Language Emergence and Sign Language Change in Nicaragua / Judy Kegl, Ann Senghas, Marie Coppola| editors = Michel DeGraff | work = Language creation and language change : creolization, diachrony, and development| year = 1999 | publisher = MIT Press| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn = 978-0-262-04168-3| oclc = 39508250}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it appears that the [[language center|language centres]] of the human brain must have evolved to function optimally irrespective of the selected modality.

This feature is extraordinary. Animal communication systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, but not one is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.

Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific "gesture-calls"&amp;nbsp;— emotionally expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burling | first1 = R | year = 1993 | title = Primate calls, human language, and nonverbal communication | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 25–53 | doi=10.1086/204132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls&amp;nbsp;— laughs, cries, sobs and so forth&amp;nbsp;— together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, D. 1992. ''Hand and Mind. What gestures reveal about thought.'' Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously.

The human linguistic property of "modality independence" is conceptually distinct from this. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel, while switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms&amp;nbsp;— handwriting, typing, e-mail and so forth. Whichever modality is chosen, it can reliably transmit the full message content without external assistance of any kind. When talking on the telephone, for example, any accompanying facial or manual gestures, however natural to the speaker, are not strictly necessary. When typing or manually signing, conversely, there's no need to add sounds. In many Australian Aboriginal cultures, a section of the population&amp;nbsp;— perhaps women observing a ritual taboo&amp;nbsp;— traditionally restrict themselves for extended periods to a silent (manually signed) version of their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kendon, A. 1988. ''Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content.

==Evolution of the speech organs==
[[Image:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal tract]]
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode our thoughts in sound&amp;nbsp;— a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus.

The speech organs, everyone agrees, evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apes use their highly flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing.   When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated.&lt;ref name="Riede 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Riede Bronson 2006" /&gt; ''Either'' it is performing gymnastics with its tongue ''or'' it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, ''Homo sapiens'' is exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion to the radically different requirements of articulate speech.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, Peter, 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongue===
[[Image:Spectrogram -iua-.png|250px|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of American English vowels {{IPA|[i, u, ɑ]}} showing the formants ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The word "language" derives from the Latin ''lingua,'' "tongue". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips. A natural language can be viewed as a particular way of using the tongue to express thought.

The human tongue has an unusual shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat structure contained largely within the mouth. It is attached at the rear to the [[hyoid bone]], situated below oral level in the [[pharynx]]. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular [[Sagittal plane|sagittal]] (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended [[pharynx]], where it is attached to a hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''', which nonhuman primates cannot do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = P. | last2 = Crelin | first2 = E.

N. 1972. The quantal nature of speech: Evidence from articulatory-acoustic data. In P. B. Denes and E. E. David, Jr. (eds.), ''Human Communication: A unified view.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 51–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It may not be coincidental that '''[i], [u]''' and '''[a]''' are the most common vowels in the world's languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Malden: MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lips===
In humans, the lips are important for the production of [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]], in addition to [[vowel]]s. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in [[tarsier]]s, monkeys and apes (the [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]]) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the [[rhinarium]] or "wet nose" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker. "Hence", according to one major authority, "the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines".&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. 2012. The anatomical and physiological basis of human speech production: adaptations and exaptations. In M. Tallerman and K. .Gibson (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether our lips have undergone more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech.

===Respiratory control===
Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. While we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;MacLarnon, A. M. (1993). The vertebral canal. In A. Walker and R. Leakey (eds.), ''The Nariokotome ''Homo erectus'' skeleton.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 359–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from fossil hominins suggests that the necessary enlargement of the vertebral canal, and therefore spinal cord dimensions, may not have occurred in ''Australopithecus'' or ''Homo erectus''  but was present in the Neanderthals and early modern humans.&lt;ref name="MacLarnon 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=MacLarnon AM, Hewitt GP |title=The evolution of human speech: the role of enhanced breathing control |journal=Am.

===Larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch.

[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of the larynx, [[anatomical terms of location|anterolateral]] view]]

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs&amp;nbsp;— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food&amp;nbsp;— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit&amp;nbsp;— so it is claimed&amp;nbsp;— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135| pmc = 3338724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech.

At least one [[orangutan]] has demonstrated the ability to control the voice box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orangutan's Vocal Feats Hint At Deeper Roots of Human Speech |author=Jon Hamilton |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/14/518170608/orangutans-vocal-feats-hint-at-deeper-roots-of-human-speech |date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"&amp;nbsp;— giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Could the Neanderthals speak?===
[[File:Gray186.png|thumb|Hyoid bone&amp;nbsp;— anterior surface, enlarged]]
[[File:Gray1194.png|thumb|Anterolateral view of head and neck]]

Most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern ''Homo sapiens''. An indirect line of argument is that their tool-making and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Coolidge, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; A recent extraction of [[DNA]] from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the [[FOXP2]] gene as modern humans. This gene, once mistakenly described as the "grammar gene", plays a role in controlling the orofacial movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas |last=Wade |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=19 October 2007 |title=Neanderthals Had Important Speech Gene, DNA Evidence Shows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19speech-web.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, it was widely believed that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Philip |last=Lieberman |author2=Edmund S. Crelin |date=Spring 1971 |title=On the Speech of Neanderthal Man |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=203–222 |doi= |doi-broken-date=22 May 2009 |jstor=4177625}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that they possessed a hyoid bone so high up in the vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds.

The hyoid bone is present in many [[mammal]]s. It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the larynx in chimpanzee infants. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 100 | issue = 12 | pages = 6930–3 | date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1231107100 | pmid = 12775758 | pmc = 165807}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now realised that its lowered position is not unique to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', while its relevance to vocal flexibility may have been overstated: although men have a lower larynx, they do not produce a wider range of sounds than women or two-year-old babies.

The morphology of the [[outer ear|outer]] and [[middle ear]] of [[Middle Pleistocene]] hominins from [[Atapuerca, Province of Burgos|Atapuerca]] SH in Spain, believed to be proto-Neanderthal, suggests they had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees.

The hypoglossal nerve plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue. In 1998, one research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either [[australopithecine]]s or apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kay | first1 = R.

==Origin of speech sounds==

===Distinctive features theory===
{{IPA vowels|class=infobox}}
According to one influential school,&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R., Gunnar, C., Fant, M. and Halle, M. 1952. ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. and M. Halle 1956. ''Fundamentals of Language.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; the human vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital on the model of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.

The human supralaryngeal tract is said to be digital in the sense that it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding [[distinctive feature]]&amp;nbsp;— in this case, "voicing"&amp;nbsp;— cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to "off" and "on". Equally digital is the feature known as "[[Nasalization|nasalisation]]". At any given moment the [[soft palate]] or velum either allows or doesn't allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed.

The theory that speech sounds are composite entities constituted by complexes of binary phonetic features was first advanced in 1938 by the Russian linguist [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1938. "Observations sur le classement phonologiques des consonnes", in ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress of Phonetic Sciences,'' Ghent.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent early supporter of this approach was [[Noam Chomsky]], who went on to extend it from phonology to language more generally, in particular to the study of syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1964 [1962]. The logical basis of linguistic theory. In H.G. Lunt (ed.), The Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Linguists. The Hague: Mouton, pp. 914-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. and Halle, M. 1968. ''The Sound Pattern of English.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1965 book, ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax,''&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 148-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky treated semantic concepts as combinations of binary-digital atomic elements explicitly on the model of distinctive features theory. The lexical item "bachelor", on this basis, would be expressed as [+ Human], [+ Male], [- Married].

Supporters of this approach view the vowels and consonants recognised by speakers of a particular language or dialect at a particular time as cultural entities of little scientific interest. From a natural science standpoint, the units which matter are those common to ''Homo sapiens'' by virtue of our biological nature. By combining the atomic elements or "features" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language.

====Criticism====
In recent years, the notion of an innate "universal grammar" underlying phonological variation has been called into question. The most comprehensive monograph ever written about speech sounds, ''Sounds of the World's Languages,'' by [[Peter Ladefoged]] and [[Ian Maddieson]],&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. and Maddieson, I. 1996. ''The Sounds of the World's Languages.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; found virtually no basis for the postulation of some small number of fixed, discrete, universal phonetic features. Examining 305 languages, for example, they encountered vowels that were positioned basically everywhere along the articulatory and acoustic continuum. Ladefoged concludes that phonological features are not determined by human nature: "Phonological features are best regarded as artifacts that linguists have devised in order to describe linguistic systems."&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, P. 2006. Features and Parameters for Different Purposes. http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/PLfeaturesParameters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Self-organization theory===
[[Image:Fugle, ørnsø 073.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Birds flocking, an example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]]]]

[[Self-organization]]  characterizes systems where macroscopic structures are spontaneously formed out of local interactions between the many components of the system.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Oudeyer | first1 = Pierre-Yves | title = Self-organization in the evolution of speech | date = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford University Press; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-928915-8 | oclc = 65203001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In self-organized systems, global organizational properties are not to be found at the local level. In colloquial terms, self-organisation is roughly captured by the idea of "bottom-up" (as opposed to "top-down") organisation. Examples of self-organized systems range from ice crystals to galaxy spirals in the inorganic world, and from spots on the leopard skins to the architecture of termite nests or shape of a flock of starlings.
[[Image:TermiteMound.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A termite mound (Macrotermitinae) in the Okavango Delta just outside [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]], [[Botswana]]]]

According to many phoneticians, the sounds of language arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organization&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom, B., MacNeilage, P. and Studdert-Kennedy, M. 1984. Self-organizing processes and the explanation of language universals. In M. Butterworth, B. Comrie and Ö Dahl (eds), ''Explanations for language universals.'' Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Co., pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2005b. Self-organisation in language. In C. Hemelrijk (ed.), ''Self-organisation and evolution of social systems.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 123–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages turn out to be a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.

How, precisely, do systems of vowels, consonants and syllables arise? Agent-based computer models take the perspective of self-organisation at the level of the speech community or population. The two main paradigms here are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation.&lt;ref name="Hurford 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford, J. R | first1 = J. R. |  title = Social transmission favours linguistic generalization.| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 324–352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the language game model, a whole population of agents simultaneously produce, perceive and learn language, inventing novel forms when the need arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steels | first1 = L | year = 1995 | title = A self-organizing spatial vocabulary | url = | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 319–332 | doi=10.1162/artl.1995.2.319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. and Vogt, P. 1997. Grounding adaptive language games in robotic agents. In P. Harvey and P. Husbands (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Artificial Life.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 474–482.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Berrah A-R., Glotin H., Laboissière R., Bessière P., Boë L-J. 1996. From Form to Formation of Phonetic Structures: An Evolutionary Computing Pers- pective, in Proc. ICML 1996 Workshop on Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning, pp. 23-29, Bari, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as de Boer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Self-organization in vowel systems | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 441–465 | doi=10.1006/jpho.2000.0125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory,&lt;ref&gt;Moulin-Frier C., Laurent R., Bessière P., Schwartz J.-L., and Diard J. 2012 Adverse Conditions Improve Distinguishability of Auditory, Motor and Perceptuo- Motor Theories of Speech Perception: an Exploratory Bayesian Modeling Study. Language and Cognitive Processes, 27(7–8):1240–1263.&lt;/ref&gt; showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents learn from each other as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel ''it thinks it has heard'', whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If this matches the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed. "Through repeated interactions," according to de Boer, "vowel systems emerge that are very much like the ones found in human languages."&lt;ref&gt;de Boer, B. 2012. Self-organization and language evolution. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), 2012. ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 612-620.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different model, the phonetician [[Björn Lindblom]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindblom. B. 1986. Phonetic universals in vowel systems. In J. J. Ohala and J. J. Jaeger (eds.), ''Experimental Phonology.'' Orlando: Academic Press, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; was able to predict, on self-organizational grounds, the favoured choices of vowel systems ranging from three to nine vowels on the basis of a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation.

Further models studied the role of self-organization in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. [[Pierre-Yves Oudeyer]] developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals.&lt;ref name="Oudeyer 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer P-Y. 2005. The Self-Organization of Speech Sounds, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233(3), pp. 435–449.&lt;/ref&gt; These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that speech was a relatively late development, evolving by degrees from a system that was originally gestural.

Two types of evidence support this theory:
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] minimise vocal signals in favour of manual, facial and other visible gestures in order to express simple concepts and communicative intentions in the wild. Some of these gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that spoken language and signing depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuromotor Mechanisms in Human Communication |author=Kimura, Doreen |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-505492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J.|year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. 1992. ''Hand and mind.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, D. (ed.) 2000. ''Language and gesture.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, many [[sign languages]] in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.

====Criticism====

Critics note that for mammals in general, sound turns out to be the best medium in which to encode information for transmission over distances at speed. Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it's hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing&amp;nbsp;— only to return to sound at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), ''Approaches to the Evolution of Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, our ancestors' hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance. The transition to spoken language is said to have occurred only at that point.&lt;ref&gt;Corballis, M. C. 2002. Did language evolve from manual gestures? In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 161-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since humans throughout evolution have been making and using tools, however, most scholars remain unconvinced by this argument. (For a different approach to this puzzle&amp;nbsp;— one setting out from considerations of signal reliability and trust&amp;nbsp;— see "from pantomime to speech" below).

==When did speech evolve?==
{{Human timeline}}
Little is known about the timing of language's emergence in  the human species. Unlike writing, speech leaves no material trace, making it archaeologically invisible. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. While such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern ''Homo'' species had speech ''capacities'', it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. While they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, [[Johanna Nichols]]&amp;nbsp;— a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley&amp;nbsp;— argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127-70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently&amp;nbsp;— in 2012&amp;nbsp;— anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | year = 2012 | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4| page = e35289 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Phonemic diversity" denotes the number of perceptually distinct units of sound&amp;nbsp;— consonants, vowels and tones&amp;nbsp;— in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern ''Homo sapiens'' out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have to have been around in order to accumulate the number of phonemes they possess today. As human populations left Africa and expanded into the rest of the world, they underwent a series of bottlenecks&amp;nbsp;— points at which only a very small population survived to colonise a new continent or region. Allegedly such population crash led to a corresponding reduction in genetic, phenotypic and phonemic diversity. [[African languages]] today have some of the largest phonemic inventories in the world, while the smallest inventories are found in South America and Oceania, some of the last regions of the globe to be colonized. For example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], a language of New Guinea, and [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Maddieson, I. 1984. ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddieson | first1 = I. | last2 = Precoda | first2 = K. | year = 1990 | title = Updating UPSID | url = | journal = UCLA Working Papers in Phonetics | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 104–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.
The authors use a natural experiment&amp;nbsp;— the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated [[Andaman Islands]] on the other&amp;nbsp;— to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time. Using this rate, they estimate that the world's languages date back to the [[Middle Stone Age]] in Africa, sometime between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago. This corresponds to the speciation event which gave rise to ''Homo sapiens''.

These and similar studies have however been criticized by linguists who argue that they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes, since phonemes are frequently transferred laterally between languages unlike genes, and on a flawed sampling of the world's languages, since both Oceania and the Americas also contain languages with very high numbers of phonemes, and Africa contains languages with very few. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hunley, Claire Bowern, and Meghan Healy ("Rejection of a serial founder effects model of genetic and linguistic coevolution", Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 2/1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowern, Claire. 2011 Out of Africa?

==Speculative scenarios==

===Early speculations===

The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.}}&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''[[Bow-wow theory|bow-wow]]'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''Pooh-Pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''Ding-Dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labour, the attempt to synchronise muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho''.
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by [[Sir Richard Paget, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Paget]].&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong&amp;nbsp;— they occasionally offer peripheral insights&amp;nbsp;— as comically naïve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic. They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
From the perspective of modern science, the main obstacle to the evolution of speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is that symbols&amp;nbsp;— arbitrary associations of sounds with corresponding meanings&amp;nbsp;— are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 227–230 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1993.0061}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Must reliable signals always be costly? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1115–1120 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.

Animal vocal signals are for the most part intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can "trust" the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable,&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, K. 2012. Have we underestimated great ape vocal capacities? In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 90-95.&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain reliable for the same reason&amp;nbsp;— because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986" /&gt; Primate social intelligence is ''Machiavellian''&amp;nbsp;— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, while at the same time constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R. and A. Whiten (eds) 1988. ''Machiavellian Intelligence. Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "displaced reference", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

==== "Kin selection" ====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W.

Fitch suggests that spoken languages were originally "mother tongues". If speech evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable vocal signals&amp;nbsp;— spoken words&amp;nbsp;— to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. Ape mothers also share genes with their offspring, as do all animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with non-kin. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited "mother tongue" networks from relatives to non-relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;Tallerman, M. In press.

'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.'' In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you.'' Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, early society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

=====Criticism=====
Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom "obligatory reciprocal altruism" could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6) , Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.&lt;ref&gt;Dessalles, J.-L. 1998.

==== "Gossip and grooming" ====
Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]], does for group-living humans what manual [[Social grooming|grooming]] does for other primates&amp;nbsp;— it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances. As humans began living in larger and larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans invented "a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"&amp;nbsp;— ''vocal grooming''.  To keep your allies happy, you now needed only to "groom" them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming (the production of pleasing sounds lacking syntax or combinatorial semantics) then evolved somehow into syntactical speech.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Criticism=====
Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of "vocal grooming"&amp;nbsp;— that words are so cheap&amp;nbsp;— would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref name="Power 1998" /&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming&amp;nbsp;— the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds&amp;nbsp;— to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

According to another school of thought, language evolved from [[mimesis]]&amp;nbsp;— the "acting out" of scenarios using vocal and gestural pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, M. 1998. Mimesis and the Executive Suite: missing links in language evolution. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C.

==== "Ritual/speech coevolution" ====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by the distinguished social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport,_R._A._1999"&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1999. ''Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998" /&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009" /&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a "theory of the origins of language". This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider&amp;nbsp;— namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. 2010. [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/The-Origins-of-Symbolic-Culture.pdf The origins of symbolic culture.] In Ulrich J. Frey, Charlotte Störmer and Kai P. Willfuhr (eds) 2010. ''Homo Novus&amp;nbsp;— A Human Without Illusions.'' Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag, pp. 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognised within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society&amp;nbsp;— one where communications technology has already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for an ape communicating with other apes in the wild. Not even the cleverest ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|"Lie and alternative, inherent in language, ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies. I have therefore argued that if there are to be words at all it is necessary to establish ''The Word,'' and that The Word is established by the invariance of liturgy."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, R. A. 1979. ''Ecology, Meaning, and Religion.'' Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. As digital hallucinations, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever ape, or even a group of articulate apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalisations that ''do'' carry conviction&amp;nbsp;— those they actually use&amp;nbsp;— are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Speech consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world&amp;nbsp;— they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society&amp;nbsp;— namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called "institutional facts") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Searle | first1 = John R. | title = The construction of social reality | year = 1995 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-02-928045-4 | oclc = 31411549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any [[hunter-gatherer]] society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915].

Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/anthropology-news/wild-voices Chris Knight and Jerome Lewis, 2017.

=====Criticism=====
Critics of the theory include [[Noam Chomsky]], who terms it the "non-existence" hypothesis&amp;nbsp;— a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky (2011): [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 Language and Other Cognitive Systems. What Is Special About Language?], Language Learning and Development, 7:4, 263-278&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting his critics in turn to retort that only something that doesn't exist&amp;nbsp;— a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction&amp;nbsp;— could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Twentieth century speculations===

====Festal origins====
The essay "The festal origin of human speech", though published in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, J. 1891-92. The festal origin of human speech, part I. ''Mind'' '''16'''(64), pp. 495-506.&lt;/ref&gt; made little impact until the American philosopher [[Susanne Langer]] re-discovered and publicised it in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, S. 1957 [1941]. ''Philosophy in a New Key.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"In the early history of articulate sounds they could make no meaning themselves, but they preserved and got intimately associated with the peculiar feelings and perceptions that came most prominently into the minds of the festal players during their excitement."|{{Citation|title=''J. Donovan, 1891.'' The Festal Origin of Human Speech.}}&lt;ref name="Donovan" /&gt;}}
The theory sets out from the observation that primate vocal sounds are above all ''emotionally'' expressive. The emotions aroused are socially contagious. Because of this, an extended bout of screams, hoots or barks will tend to express not just the feelings of this or that individual but the mutually contagious ups and downs of everyone within earshot.

Turning to the ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'', the "festal origin" theory suggests that in the "play-excitement" preceding or following a communal hunt or other group activity, everyone might have combined their voices in a comparable way, emphasising their mood of togetherness with such noises as rhythmic drumming and hand-clapping. Variably pitched voices would have formed conventional patterns, such that choral singing became an integral part of communal celebration.

Although this was not yet speech, according to Langer, it developed the vocal capacities from which speech would later derive. There would be conventional modes of ululating, clapping or dancing appropriate to different festive occasions, each so intimately associated with ''that kind of occasion'' that it would tend to collectively uphold and embody the concept of it. Anyone hearing a snatch of sound from such a song would recall the associated occasion and mood. A melodic, rhythmic sequence of syllables conventionally associated with a certain type of celebration would become, in effect, its vocal mark. On that basis, certain familiar sound sequences would become "symbolic".

In support of all this, Langer cites ethnographic reports of tribal songs consisting entirely of "rhythmic nonsense syllables". She concedes that an English equivalent such as "hey-nonny-nonny", although perhaps suggestive of certain feelings or ideas, is neither noun, verb, adjective, nor any other syntactical part of speech. So long as articulate sound served only in the capacity of "hey nonny-nonny", "hallelujah" or "alack-a-day", it cannot yet have been speech. For that to arise, according to Langer, it was necessary for such sequences to be emitted increasingly ''out of context''&amp;nbsp;— outside the total situation that gave rise to them. Extending a set of associations from one cognitive context to another, completely different one, is the secret of ''metaphor''. Langer invokes an early version of what is nowadays termed "grammaticalisation" theory to show how, from, such a point of departure, syntactically complex speech might progressively have arisen.

Langer acknowledges [[Emile Durkheim]] as having proposed a strikingly similar theory back in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1976 [1912]. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life.''

===="Musilanguage"====
The term "musilanguage" (or "hmmmmm") refers to a pre-linguistic system of vocal communication from which (according to some scholars) ''both'' music ''and'' language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech articulators. Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, "we're setting off to find honey" might sound qualitatively different from "we're setting off to hunt" or "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that of everyone else, group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.

Archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]] speculates that the Neanderthals possessed some such system, expressing themselves in a "language" known as "Hmmmmm", standing for '''H'''olistic, '''m'''anipulative, '''m'''ulti-'''m'''odal, '''m'''usical and '''m'''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;169-175&lt;/sup&gt; In Bruce Richman's earlier version of essentially the same idea,&lt;ref name="Richman 2000" /&gt; frequent repetition of the same few songs by many voices made it easy for people to remember those sequences as whole units. Activities that a group of people were doing while they were vocalising together&amp;nbsp;— activities that were important or striking or richly emotional&amp;nbsp;— came to be associated with particular sound sequences, so that each time a fragment was heard, it evoked highly specific memories. The idea is that the earliest lexical items (words) started out as abbreviated fragments of what were originally communal songs.

{{quotation|"Whenever people sang or chanted a particular sound sequence they would remember the concrete particulars of the situation most strongly associated with it: ah, yes! we sing this during this particular ritual admitting new members to the group; or, we chant this during a long journey in the forest; or, when a clearing is finished for a new camp, this is what we chant; or these are the keenings we sing during ceremonies over dead members of our group."|{{Citation|title=''Richman, B. 2000. How music fixed "nonsense" into significant formulas: on rhythm, repetition, and meaning. In N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown (eds), ''The Origins of Music: An introduction to evolutionary musicology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, pp. 301-314.}}}}

As group members accumulated an expanding repertoire of songs for different occasions, interpersonal call-and-response patterns evolved along one trajectory to assume linguistic form. Meanwhile, along a divergent trajectory, polyphonic singing and other kinds of music became increasingly specialised and sophisticated.

To explain the establishment of syntactical speech, Richman cites English "I wanna go home". He imagines this to have been learned in the first instance not as a combinatorial sequence of free-standing words, but as a single stuck-together combination&amp;nbsp;— the melodic sound people make to express "feeling homesick". Someone might sing "I wanna go home", prompting other voices to chime in with "I need to go home", "I'd love to go home", "Let's go home" and so forth. Note that one part of the song remains constant, while another is permitted to vary. If this theory is accepted, syntactically complex speech began evolving as each chanted mantra allowed for variation at a certain point, allowing for the insertion of an element from some other song. For example, while mourning during a funeral rite, someone might want to recall a memory of collecting honey with the deceased, signalling this at an appropriate moment with a fragment of the "we're collecting honey" song.  Imagine that such practices became common. Meaning-laden utterances would now have become subject to a distinctively linguistic creative principle&amp;nbsp;— that of recursive embedding.

====Hunter-gatherer egalitarianism====
[[File:Mbendjele meat sharing.jpg|thumb|Mbendjele hunter-gatherer meat sharing]]
Many scholars associate the evolutionary emergence of speech with profound social, sexual, political and cultural developments. One view is that primate-style dominance needed to give way to a more cooperative and egalitarian lifestyle of the kind characteristic of modern hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193"&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2011). Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language. In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

=====Intersubjectivity=====
According to [[Michael Tomasello]], the key cognitive capacity distinguishing ''Homo sapiens'' from our ape cousins is "[[intersubjectivity]]". This entails [[turn-taking]] and role-reversal: your partner strives to read your mind, you simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes a conscious effort to assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.

Tomasello argues that this kind of bi-directional cognition is central to the very possibility of linguistic communication. Drawing on his research with both children and chimpanzees, he reports that human infants, from one year old onwards, begin viewing their own mind as if from the standpoint of others. He describes this as a cognitive revolution. Chimpanzees, as they grow up, never undergo such a revolution. The explanation, according to Tomasello, is that their evolved psychology is adapted to a deeply competitive way of life. Wild-living chimpanzees form despotic social hierarchies, most interactions involving calculations of dominance and submission. An adult chimp will strive to outwit its rivals by guessing at their intentions while blocking them from reciprocating. Since bi-directional intersubjective communication is impossible under such conditions, the cognitive capacities necessary for language don't evolve.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999"&gt;Tomasello, M. 1999.

Whiten 1996. Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution. In P. Mellars and K. Gibson (eds), ''Modelling the Early Human Mind.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute Monographs, pp. 139-150.&lt;/ref&gt; primate-style dominance provoked equal and opposite coalitionary resistance&amp;nbsp;— ''counter-dominance.'' During the course of human evolution, increasingly effective strategies of rebellion against dominant individuals led to a compromise. While abandoning any attempt to dominate others, group members vigorously asserted their personal autonomy, maintaining their alliances to make potentially dominant individuals think twice. Within increasingly stable coalitions, according to this perspective, status began to be earned in novel ways, social rewards accruing to those perceived by their peers as especially cooperative and self-aware.&lt;ref name="Whiten, A 1999. pp. 173-193" /&gt;

=====Reverse dominance=====
While counter-dominance, according to this evolutionary narrative, culminates in a stalemate, anthropologist Christopher Boehm&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 1997. Egalitarian behaviour and the evolution of political intelligence. In A. Whiten and R. W. Byrne (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and evaluations.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 341-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest. The evolution of egalitarian behavior.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; extends the logic a step further. Counter-dominance tips over at last into full-scale "reverse dominance". The rebellious coalition decisively overthrows the figure of the primate alpha-male. No dominance is allowed except that of the self-organised community as a whole.

As a result of this social and political change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

====Scenarios involving mother-infant interactions====

====="Putting the baby down"=====
According to Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory, vocal interactions between early hominin mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early Hominins: Whence motherese? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 491–503 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their monkey and ape counterparts, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed reassurance that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.

;Criticism
While this theory may explain a certain kind of infant-directed "protolanguage"&amp;nbsp;— known today as "motherese"&amp;nbsp;— it does little to solve the really difficult problem, which is the emergence among adults of syntactical speech. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=====Co-operative breeding=====
Evolutionary anthropologist Sarah Hrdy&lt;ref name="Hrdy 2009"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hrdy | first1 = Sarah Blaffer | title = Mothers and others : the evolutionary origins of mutual understanding | year = 2009 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-03299-6 | oclc = 261174072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that only human mothers among great apes are willing to let another individual take hold of their own babies; further, we are routinely willing to let others babysit. She identifies lack of trust as the major factor preventing chimp, bonobo or gorilla mothers from doing the same: "If ape mothers insist on carrying their babies everywhere&amp;nbsp;... it is because the available alternatives are not safe enough." The fundamental problem is that ape mothers (unlike monkey mothers who may often babysit) do not have female relatives nearby. The strong implication is that, in the course of ''Homo'' evolution, allocare could develop because ''Homo'' mothers did have female kin close by&amp;nbsp;— in the first place, most reliably, their own mothers. Extending the [[Grandmother hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Hawkes 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = K. | last2 = O'Connell | first2 = JF. | last3 = Jones | first3 = NG. | last4 = Alvarez | first4 = H. | last5 = Charnov | first5 = EL. | title = Grandmothering, menopause, and the evolution of human life histories. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336–9 |date=Feb 1998 | pmc = 18762 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/1336.full | PMID = 9448332 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.1336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrdy argues that evolving ''[[Homo erectus]]'' females necessarily relied on female kin initially; this novel situation in ape evolution of mother, infant and mother's mother as allocarer provided the evolutionary ground for the emergence of intersubjectivity. She relates this onset of "cooperative breeding in an ape" to shifts in life history and slower child development, linked to the change in brain and body size from the 2 million year mark.

Primatologist Klaus Zuberbühler&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, K. 2012. Cooperative breeding and the evolution of vocal flexibility. In Tallerman, M. and K. Gibson (eds), ''The Oxford Handbook of Human Evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 71-81.&lt;/ref&gt; uses these ideas to help explain the emergence of vocal flexibility in the human species. Co-operative breeding would have compelled infants to struggle actively to gain the attention of caregivers, not all of whom would have been directly related. A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge. Natural selection, according to this view, would have favoured babies with advanced vocal skills, beginning with babbling (which triggers positive responses in care-givers) and paving the way for the elaborate and unique speech abilities of modern humans.

=====Was "mama" the first word?=====
These ideas might be linked to those of the renowned structural linguist Roman Jakobson, who claimed that "the sucking activities of the child are accompanied by a slight nasal murmur, the only phonation to be produced when the lips are pressed to the mother's breast&amp;nbsp;... and the mouth is full".&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. 1960. "Why 'Mama' and 'Papa'". In B. Caplan and S. Wagner (eds), ''Essays in Honor of Heinz Werner.'' New York: International Universities Press, pp. 124-134; p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that later in the infant's development, "this phonatory reaction to nursing is reproduced as an anticipatory signal at the mere sight of food and finally as a manifestation of a desire to eat, or more generally, as an expression of discontent and impatient longing for missing food or absent nurser, and any ungranted wish." So, the action of opening and shutting the mouth, combined with the production of a nasal sound when the lips are closed, yielded the sound sequence "Mama", which may therefore count as the very first word. Peter MacNeilage sympathetically discusses this theory in his major book, The ''Origin of Speech'', linking it with Dean Falk's "putting the baby down" theory (see above).&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 2008. ''The Origin of Speech.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt; Needless to say, other scholars have suggested completely different candidates for ''Homo sapiens''' very first word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kenneally | first1 = Christine. | title = The first word : the search for the origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Viking | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-670-03490-1 | oclc = 80460757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niche construction theory====
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego. Beavers adapt to an environmental niche which they shape by their own activities.]]While the biological language faculty is genetically inherited, actual languages or dialects are culturally transmitted, as are social norms, technological traditions and so forth. Biologists expect a robust co-evolutionary trajectory linking human genetic evolution with the evolution of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Richerson, P. J. and R. Boyd, 2004. ''Not by Genes Alone: How culture transformed human evolution.'' Chicago: Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals capable of rudimentary forms of protolanguage would have enjoyed enhanced access to cultural understandings, while these, conveyed in ways that young brains could readily learn, would in turn have become transmitted with increasing efficiency.

In some ways like beavers as they construct their dams, humans have always engaged in [[niche construction]], creating novel environments to which they subsequently become adapted. Selection pressures associated with prior niches tend to become relaxed as humans depend increasingly on novel environments created continuously by their own productive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laland | first1 = K.

==Conceptual frameworks==

===Structuralism===
{{quotation|"Consider a knight in chess. Is the piece by itself an element of the game? Certainly not. For as a material object, separated from its square on the board and the other conditions of play, it is of no significance for the player. It becomes a real, concrete element only when it takes on or becomes identified with its value in the game. Suppose that during a game this piece gets destroyed or lost. Can it be replaced? Of course it can. Not only by some other knight, but even by an object of quite a different shape, which can be counted as a knight, provided it is assigned the same value as the missing piece."|{{Citation|title=Saussure, F. de 1983 [1916]. ''Course in General Linguistics.'' Translated by R. Harris. London: Duckworth, pp. 108-09.}}}}  The Swiss scholar [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] founded linguistics as a twentieth-century professional discipline. Saussure regarded a language as a rule-governed system, much like a board game such as chess. In order to understand chess, he insisted, we must ignore such external factors as the weather prevailing during a particular session or the material composition of this or that piece. The game is autonomous with respect to its material embodiments. In the same way, when studying language, it's essential to focus on its internal structure as a social institution. External matters (''e.g.'', the shape of the human tongue) are irrelevant from this standpoint. Saussure regarded 'speaking' ''(parole)'' as individual, ancillary and more or less accidental by comparison with "language" ''(langue)'', which he viewed as collective, systematic and essential.

Saussure showed little interest in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Nor did he consider it worthwhile to speculate about how language might originally have evolved. Saussure's assumptions in fact cast doubt on the validity of narrowly conceived origins scenarios. His structuralist paradigm, when accepted in its original form, turns scholarly attention to a wider problem: how our species acquired the capacity to establish [[social institutions]] in general.

===Behaviourism===
{{Main|Behaviourism}}
{{quotation|"The basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods can be extended to human behaviour without serious modification."|{{Citation|title=Skinner, B.F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts, p. 3.}}}} In the United States, prior to and immediately following World War II, the dominant psychological paradigm was [[behaviourism]]. Within this conceptual framework, language was seen as a certain kind of behaviour&amp;nbsp;— namely, verbal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. 1957. ''Verbal Behavior.'' New York: Appleton Century Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; to be studied much like any other kind of behaviour in the animal world. Rather as a laboratory rat learns how to find its way through an artificial maze, so a human child learns the verbal behaviour of the society into which it is born. The phonological, grammatical and other complexities of speech are in this sense "external" phenomena, inscribed into an initially unstructured brain. Language's emergence in ''Homo sapiens,'' from this perspective, presents no special theoretical challenge. Human behaviour, whether verbal or otherwise, illustrates the malleable nature of the mammalian&amp;nbsp;— and especially the human&amp;nbsp;— brain.

===Chomskyan Nativism===
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|left|The [[modularity of mind]] is an idea which was prefigured in some respects by the 19th-century movement of [[phrenology]].]]
{{Main|Jerry Fodor on mental architecture}}{{Main|Cognitive revolution}}Nativism is the theory that humans are born with certain specialised [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitive]] [[modularity|modules]] enabling us to acquire highly complex bodies of knowledge such as the grammar of a language.

{{quotation|"There is a long history of study of origin of language, asking how it arose from calls of apes and so forth. That investigation in my view is a complete waste of time, because language is based on an entirely different principle than any animal communication system." |{{Citation|title=Chomsky, N., 1988. ''Language and Problems of Knowledge.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, p. 183.}}}}

From the mid-1950s onwards, [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N | year = 1959 | title = Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 26–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1966. ''Cartesian Linguistics. A chapter in the history of rationalist thought.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Fodor, 1983. ''The Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and others mounted what they conceptualised as a 'revolution' against behaviourism. Retrospectively, this became labelled 'the [[cognitive revolution]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. 1985. ''The Mind's New Science. A history of the cognitive revolution.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. and C. E. Erneling (eds.), 1997. ''The Future of the Cognitive Revolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas behaviourism had denied the scientific validity of the concept of "mind", Chomsky replied that, in fact, the concept of "body" is more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Nature and Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviourists tended to view the child's brain as a ''tabula rasa'', initially lacking structure or cognitive content. According to B. F. Skinner, for example, richness of behavioural detail (whether verbal or non-verbal) emanated from the environment. Chomsky turned this idea on its head. The linguistic environment encountered by a young child, according to Chomsky's version of [[psychological nativism]], is in fact hopelessly inadequate. No child could possibly acquire the complexities of grammar from such an impoverished source.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1980. ''Rules and Representations.'' New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Far from viewing language as wholly external, Chomsky re-conceptualised it as wholly internal. To explain how a child so rapidly and effortlessly acquires its natal language, he insisted, we must conclude that it comes into the world with the essentials of grammar already pre-installed.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; No other species, according to Chomsky, is genetically equipped with a language faculty&amp;nbsp;— or indeed with anything remotely like one.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000"&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of such a faculty in ''Homo sapiens'', from this standpoint, presents biological science with a major theoretical challenge.

===Speech act theory===
{{Main|Speech act theory}}One way to explain biological complexity is by reference to its inferred function. According to the influential philosopher [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1978 [1955]. ''How to Do Things with Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; speech's primary function is action in the social world.

[[Speech acts]], according to this body of theory, can be analysed on three different levels: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. An act is ''locutionary'' when viewed as the production of certain linguistic sounds&amp;nbsp;— for example, practicing correct pronunciation in a foreign language. An act is ''illocutionary'' insofar as it constitutes an intervention in the world as jointly perceived or understood. Promising, marrying, divorcing, declaring, stating, authorising, announcing and so forth are all speech acts in this ''illocutionary'' sense. An act is ''perlocutionary'' when viewed in terms of its direct psychological effect on an audience. Frightening a baby by saying 'Boo!' would be an example of a "perlocutionary" act.

For Austin, "doing things" with words means, first and foremost, deploying ''illocutionary'' force. The secret of this is community participation or collusion. There must be a 'correct' (conventionally agreed) procedure, and all those concerned must accept that it has been properly followed. {{quotation|"One of our examples was, for instance, the utterance 'I do' (take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife), as uttered in the course of a marriage ceremony. Here we should say that in saying these words we are ''doing'' something&amp;nbsp;— namely, marrying, rather than ''reporting'' something, namely ''that'' we are marrying."|{{Citation|title=Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 12-13.}}}} In the case of a priest declaring a couple to be man and wife, his words will have illocutionary force only if he is properly authorised and only if the ceremony is properly conducted, using words deemed appropriate to the occasion. Austin points out that should anyone attempt to baptize a penguin, the act would be null and void. For reasons which have nothing to do with physics, chemistry or biology, baptism is inappropriate to be applied to penguins, irrespective of the verbal formulation used.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. 1962. ''How To Do Things With Words.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This body of theory may have implications for speculative scenarios concerning the origins of speech. "Doing things with words" presupposes shared understandings and agreements pertaining not just to language but to social conduct more generally. Apes might produce sequences of structured sound, influencing one another in that way. To deploy ''illocutionary'' force, however, they would need to have entered a non-physical and non-biological realm&amp;nbsp;— one of shared contractual and other intangibles. This novel cognitive domain consists of what philosophers term "institutional facts"&amp;nbsp;— objective facts whose existence, paradoxically, depends on communal faith or belief.&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969" /&gt; Few primatologists, evolutionary psychologists or anthropologists consider that nonhuman primates are capable of the necessary levels of joint attention, sustained commitment or collaboration in pursuit of future goals.&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. 2006, Why don't apes point?

===Biosemiotics===
[[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]{{Main|Biosemiotics}}

{{quotation|"the deciphering of the genetic code has revealed our possession of a language much older than hieroglyphics, a language as old as life itself, a language that is the most living language of all&amp;nbsp;— even if its letters are invisible and its words are buried in the cells of our bodies."|{{Citation|title=Beadle, G. and M. Beadle, 1966. ''The Language of Life. An introduction to the science of genetics.'' Doubleday and Co, New York.}}}}

Biosemiotics is a relatively new discipline, inspired in large part by the discovery of the genetic code in the early 1960s. Its basic assumption is that ''Homo sapiens'' is not alone in its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence [[Semiotics|semiotic]] principles must apply also in the animal world.

The discovery of the molecular structure of DNA apparently contradicted the idea that life could be explained, ultimately, in terms of the fundamental laws of physics. The letters of the genetic alphabet seemed to have "meaning", yet meaning is not a concept which has any place in physics. The natural science community initially solved this difficulty by invoking the concept of "information", treating information as independent of meaning. But a different solution to the puzzle was to recall that the laws of physics in themselves are never sufficient to explain natural phenomena. To explain, say, the unique physical and chemical characteristics of the planets in our solar system, scientists must work out how the laws of physics became constrained by particular sequences of events following the formation of the Sun.

According to Howard Pattee&amp;nbsp;— a pioneering figure in biosemiotics&amp;nbsp;— the same principle applies to the evolution of life on earth, a process in which certain "frozen accidents" or "natural constraints" have from time to time drastically reduced the number of possible evolutionary outcomes. Codes, when they prove to be stable over evolutionary time, are constraints of this kind. The most fundamental such "frozen accident" was the emergence of DNA as a self-replicating molecule, but the history of life on earth has been characterised by a succession of comparably dramatic events, each of which can be conceptualised as the emergence of a new code.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, M. 2003. ''The Organic Codes. An Introduction to Semantic Biology.''

===The Handicap principle===
{{Main|Handicap principle}}

[[Image:Peacock front02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|A peacock's tail: a classic example of costly signalling]]

In 1975, the Israeli theoretical biologist [[Amotz Zahavi]]&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1975"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap. | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–14 |date=Sep 1975 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3| pmid = 1195756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1977"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The cost of honesty (further remarks on the handicap principle). | journal = J Theor Biol | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–5 |date=Aug 1977 | doi =  10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3| pmid = 904334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Zehavi | first1 = Amots. | last2 = Zahavi | first2 = Avishag. | title = The handicap principle : a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle | year = 1997 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-510035-8 | oclc = 35360821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel theory which, although controversial, has come to dominate Darwinian thinking on how signals evolve. Zahavi's "handicap principle" states that to be effective, signals must be reliable; to be reliable, the bodily investment in them must be so high as to make cheating unprofitable.

Paradoxically, if this logic is accepted, signals in nature evolve not to be efficient but, on the contrary, to be elaborate and wasteful of time and energy. A peacock's tail is the classic illustration. Zahavi's theory is that since peahens are on the look-out for male braggarts and cheats, they insist on a display of quality so costly that only a genuinely fit peacock could afford to pay. Needless to say, not all signals in the animal world are quite as elaborate as a peacock's tail. But if Zahavi is correct, all require some bodily investment&amp;nbsp;— an expenditure of time and energy which "handicaps" the signaller in some way.

Animal vocalisations (according to Zahavi) are reliable because they are faithful reflections of the state of the signaller's body. To switch from an honest to a deceitful call, the animal would have to adopt a different bodily posture. Since every bodily action has its own optimal starting position, changing that position to produce a false message would interfere with the task of carrying out the action really intended. The gains made by cheating would not make up for the losses incurred by assuming an improper posture&amp;nbsp;— and so the phony message turns out to be not worth its price.&lt;ref name="Zehavi 1997" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/sup&gt; This may explain, in particular, why ape and monkey vocal signals have evolved to be so strikingly inflexible when compared with the varied speech sounds produced by the human tongue. The apparent inflexibility of chimpanzee vocalisations may strike the human observer as surprising until we realise that being inflexible is necessarily bound up with being perceptibly honest in the sense of "hard-to-fake".

If we accept this theory, the emergence of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve.&lt;ref name="Zahavi, A 1993" /&gt; The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue&amp;nbsp;— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body&amp;nbsp;— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have found it difficult to explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.

An influential standard textbook is ''Animal Signals,'' by [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[David Harper (biologist)|David Harper]].&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signal | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852685-8 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors divide the costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts&amp;nbsp;— for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin&amp;nbsp;— some investment must be made to guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication&amp;nbsp;— eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission&amp;nbsp;— is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{Main|Cognitive linguistics}}Cognitive linguistics views linguistic structure as arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering new ways to convey meanings by producing sounds, and in some cases these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and semantic structure there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing of sound and meaning involves an imaginative leap.

In their book, ''Metaphors We Live By,'' [[George Lakoff]] and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, claiming that ''[[metaphor]]'' is what makes human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact ''constitutes'' distinctively human&amp;nbsp;— that is, distinctively abstract&amp;nbsp;— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived&amp;nbsp;— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice&amp;nbsp;— we have no choice but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ''ideas are locations, thinking is moving'' and ''mind is body''. For example, we might express the idea of "arriving at a crucial point in our argument" by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.

Metaphors, by definition, are not literally true. Strictly speaking, they are fictions&amp;nbsp;— from a pedantic standpoint, even falsehoods. But if we couldn't resort to metaphorical fictions, it's doubtful whether we could even form conceptual representations of such nebulous phenomena as "ideas", thoughts", "minds", and so forth.

The bearing of these ideas on current thinking on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure ''not'' to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might prove to be a fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving until our ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008" /&gt;

===Natural science or social science?===

====Social reality====
{{Main|Social reality}}When people converse with one another, according to the American philosopher [[John Searle]], they're making moves, not in the real world which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of [[illocutionary force]] requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level&amp;nbsp;— that of ''social'' reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of "brute facts"&amp;nbsp;— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief&amp;nbsp;— but of "institutional facts", which "exist" only if you believe in them. Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of "institutional facts". One can distinguish between "brute" facts and "institutional" ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact&amp;nbsp;— would it still be true? If the answer is "yes", it's "brute". If the answer is "no", it's "institutional".&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;

{{quotation|"Imagine a group of primitive creatures, more or less like ourselves&amp;nbsp;... Now imagine that, acting as a group, they build a barrier, a wall around the place where they live&amp;nbsp;... The wall is designed to keep intruders out and keep members of the group in&amp;nbsp;... Let us suppose that the wall gradually decays. It slowly deteriorates until all that is left is a line of stones. But let us suppose that the inhabitants continue to treat the line of stones as if it could perform the function of the wall. Let us suppose that, as a matter of fact, they treat the line of stones just as if they understood that it was not to be crossed&amp;nbsp;... This shift is the decisive move in the creation of institutional reality. It is nothing less than the decisive move in the creation of what we think of as distinctive in human, as opposed to animal, societies."|{{Citation| title = ''John R. Searle, 1995.'' The construction of social reality, ''Free Press, pp.134''}}&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt;}}

The facts of language in general and of speech in particular are, from this perspective, "institutional" rather than "brute". The semantic meaning of a word, for example, is whatever its users imagine it to be. To "do things with words" is to operate in a virtual world which seems real because we share it in common. In this incorporeal world, the laws of physics, chemistry and biology do not apply. That explains why illocutionary force can be deployed without exerting muscular effort. Apes and monkeys inhabit the "brute" world. To make an impact, they must scream, bark, threaten, seduce or in other ways invest bodily effort. If they were invited to play chess, they would be unable to resist throwing their pieces at one another. Speech is not like that. A few movements of the tongue, under appropriate conditions, can be sufficient to open parliament, annul a marriage, confer a knighthood or declare war.&lt;ref name="Searle, J 1969"&gt;Searle, J. 1969. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t3_WhfknvF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Speech Acts. An essay in the Philosophy of Language].'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain, on a Darwinian basis, how such apparent magic first began to work, we must ask how, when and why ''Homo sapiens'' succeeded in establishing the wider domain of institutional facts.

====Nature or society?====
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
"[[Brute fact#Searle|Brute facts]]", in the terminology of speech act philosopher [[John Searle]],&lt;ref name="Searle 1995" /&gt; are facts which are true anyway, regardless of human belief. Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. [[Natural science]] is the study of facts of this kind. "Institutional facts" are fictions accorded factual status within human [[social institutions]]. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact. But now imagine a collapse of public confidence in the currency system. Suddenly, the realities in my pocket dissolve.

Scholars who doubt the scientific validity of the notion of "institutional facts" include [[Noam Chomsky]], for whom language is not social. In Chomsky's view, language is a natural object (a component of the individual brain) and its study, therefore, a branch of natural science. In explaining the origin of language, scholars in this intellectual camp invoke non-social developments&amp;nbsp;— in Chomsky's case, a random genetic mutation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky, N 2000" /&gt; Chomsky argues that language might exist inside the brain of a single mutant gorilla even if no one else believed in it, even if no one else existed apart from the mutant&amp;nbsp;— and even if the gorilla in question remained unaware of its existence, never actually speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 2000. ''The Architecture of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 17-18..&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite philosophical camp are those who, in the tradition of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], argue that if no one believed in words or rules, they simply would not exist. These scholars, correspondingly, regard language as essentially institutional, concluding that linguistics should be considered a topic within [[social science]]. In explaining the evolutionary emergence of language, scholars in this intellectual camp tend to invoke profound changes in social relationships.&lt;ref name="Knight 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomasello, M 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dessalles 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dessalles | first1 = Jean-Louis. | title = Why we talk : the evolutionary origins of language | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-927623-3 | oclc = 71329834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism.''' Darwinian scientists today see little value in the traditional distinction between "natural" and "social" science. [[Darwinism]] in its modern form is the study of cooperation and competition in nature&amp;nbsp;— a topic which is intrinsically social.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. L. 1985. ''Social Evolution.'' Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this background, there is an increasing awareness among evolutionary linguists and Darwinian anthropologists that traditional inter-disciplinary barriers can have damaging consequences for investigations into the origins of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Hurford | first1 = James R. | last2 = Studdert-Kennedy | first2 = Michael. | last3 = Knight | first3 = Chris | title = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dunbar | first1 = Robin I.M.  | last2 = Knight | first2 = Chris | last3 = Power | first3 = Camilla. | title = The evolution of culture : an interdisciplinary vie | year = 1999 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | location = Edinburgh | isbn = 978-0-7486-1076-1 | oclc = 807340111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris | last2 = Studdert-Kennedy | first2 = Michael. | last3 = Hurford | first3 = James R. | title = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic form | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Removed external link to an archive of "Recent Proxy Statements" published by the SEC. This link takes the user to an archive of 2009 proxy statements and surfing the URL screenshots to more recent archives only go through 2012. These screenshot archives are therefore irrelevant and certainly not "recent." Perhaps a new web URL now houses recent proxy statements.</comment>

A '''proxy statement''' is a statement required of a firm when soliciting shareholder votes. This statement is filed in advance of the annual meeting. The firm needs to file a proxy statement, otherwise known as a Form DEF 14A (Definitive Proxy Statement), with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].  This statement is useful in assessing how management is paid and potential conflict-of-interest issues with auditors.  The statement includes:
* Voting procedure and information.
* Background information about the company's nominated directors including relevant history in the company or industry, positions on other corporate boards, and potential conflicts in interest.
* Board compensation.
* Executive compensation, including salary, bonus, non-equity compensation, stock awards, options, and [[deferred compensation]]. Also, information is included about perks such as personal use of company aircraft, travel, and tax gross-ups. Many companies will also include pre-determined payout packages for if an executive leaves the company.
* Who is on the audit committee, as well as a breakdown of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor.

SEC proxy rules: The term "proxy statement" means the statement required by Section 240.14a-3(a) whether or not contained in a single document.

In many cases, shareholder votes—particularly institutional shareholder votes—are determined by [[proxy firm]]s which advise the shareholders...

Traditionally, [[broker-dealer]]s have been permitted to vote for "routine" proposals on behalf of their shareholders if the shareholders do not return the proxy statement. This has been controversial, and in 2006 the NYSE Proxy Working Group recommended that the rules be modified so that uncontested director elections were not considered routine.&lt;ref&gt;NYSE Working Group. (June 5, 2006). [https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/REVISED_NYSE_Report_6_5_06.pdf REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PROXY WORKING GROUP TO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE].&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC approved the rule on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2009/34-60215.pdf Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Amendment No. 4, to Amend NYSE Rule 452 and Corresponding Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 to Eliminate Broker Discretionary Voting for the Election of Directors, Except for Companies Registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to Codify Two Previously Published Interpretations that Do Not Permit Broker Discretionary Voting for Material Amendments to Investment Advisory Contracts with an Investment Company]. Release No. 34-60215; File No. SR-NYSE-2006-92. Discussed by the NY Times Dealbook at: [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/sec-split-on-broker-voting-change/ Curbs on Broker Voting Are Approved].&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the SEC announced that it was seeking public comment on the efficiency of the proxy system.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-122.htm SEC Votes to Seek Public Comment on U.S. Proxy System].&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some controversy over "proxy access" which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement. Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the proxy statement. The United States [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-155.htm SEC Adopts New Measures to Facilitate Director Nominations by Shareholders].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the rule was struck down by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120403125211/http://corpgov.proxyexchange.org/2011/07/what-would-proxy-access-look-like-if-done-right/ What Would Proxy Access Look Like if Done Right?].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1024">'''Reallocation''' is a term in the [[media industry]] used to describe the practice of relocating an unsuccessful series that was originally developed for a [[broadcast network]] onto a [[cable network]] in hopes of gaining the attention and interest of a [[niche audience]] as well as  growing a larger audience.

Reasons for reallocation are not always due to [[Cancellation (television)|cancellation]]. Reallocation is  also used to regain expenses lost due to production fees on under performing content. In some cases reallocation is used in order to promote an unsuccessful series.

Although not a common practice,

'''Saam kap dai''' （{{zh|c=三及第}}; IPA: {{IPA|[saːm˥ kʰɐp̚˨ tɐi̯˧˥]}}） is a writing style combining [[Classical Chinese]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantonese as Written Language, p.127, Don Snow, Hong Kong University Press, {{ISBN|978-962-209-709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles and stories written in saam kap dai first appeared in Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) [[newspaper]]s in the 1940s to 1950s. It became more popular in [[Hong Kong]] newspapers from the late 1940s to the 1960s.

The use of different style of Chinese gives the article varied tones. Sentences in Classical Chinese give the formal tone. Standard Chinese is usually neutral. Cantonese gives an impression of [[colloquial]], local speech and [[slang]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13863">In non-functional [[linguistics]], a '''sentence''' is a textual unit consisting of one or more [[word|words]] that are grammatically linked. In functional linguistics, a '''sentence''' is a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]''. Arnold: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This entry is mainly about ''sentence'' in its non-functional sense, though much work in functional linguistics is indirectly cited or considered such as the categories of Speech Act Theory.

A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement, [[question]], exclamation, request, [[Imperative mood|command]] or [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sentence |title='Sentence' – Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A sentence is a set of words that in principle tells a complete thought (although it may make little sense taken in isolation out of [[context (language use)|context]]) It may be a simple [[phrase]], but it conveys enough [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] to imply a [[clause]], even if it is not explicit; for example, "Two" as a sentence (in answer to the question "How many were there?") implies the clause "There were two." Typically a sentence contains a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. A sentence can also be defined purely in orthographic terms, as a group of words starting with a capital letter and ending in a full stop.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]''. Arnold: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the teaching of writing skills ([[composition (language)|composition]] skills), students are generally required to express (rather than imply) the elements of a sentence, leading to the schoolbook definition of a sentence as one that must [explicitly] include a subject and a verb. For example, in [[second-language acquisition]], teachers often reject one-word answers that only imply a clause, commanding the student to "give me a complete sentence," by which they mean an explicit one.

As with all language expressions, sentences might contain [[function word|function]] and [[content word|content]] words and contain properties such as characteristic [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and timing patterns.

Sentences are generally characterized in most languages by the inclusion of a [[finite verb]], e.g. "[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog|The quick brown fox ''jumps'' over the lazy dog]]."

== Typical associates ==

=== Clauses ===
In non-functional linguistics, a '''simple complete sentence''' consists of a '''single clause'''. In functional linguistics, a sentence is typically associated with a clause and a clause can be either a '''clause simplex''' or a '''clause complex'''. A clause is a clause simplex if it represents a single process going on through time and it is a clause complex if it represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes.

A [[clause|clause (simplex)]] typically contains a predication structure with a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] noun phrase and a [[finite verb]]. Although the subject is usually a noun phrase, other kinds of [[phrase]]s (such as [[gerund]] phrases) work as well, and some languages allow subjects to be omitted. In the examples below, the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of ''boiling'' is in square brackets. Notice that there is clause embedding in the second and third examples.

:''[Water]'' boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
:''It'' is quite interesting ''that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius''.
:''The fact that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius'' is quite interesting.

There are two types of clauses: ''independent'' and ''non-independent''/''interdependent''. An independent clause realises a speech act such as a statement, a question, a command or an offer. A non-independent clause does not realise any act. A non-independent clause (simplex or complex) is usually logically related to other non-independent clauses. Together they usually constitute a single independent clause (complex). For that reason, non-independent clauses are also called ''interdependent''. For instance, the non-independent clause ''because I have no friends'' is related to the non-independent clause ''I don't go out'' in ''I don't go out, because I have no friends''. The whole clause complex is independent because it realises a statement. What is stated is the causal nexus between having no friend and not going out. When such a statement is acted out, the fact that the speaker doesn't go out is already established, therefore it cannot be stated. What is still open and under negotiation is the reason for that fact. The causal nexus is represented by the independent clause complex and not by the two interdependent clause simplexes.

See also [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] for the consequences of the verb ''to be'' on the theory of sentence structure.

== Classification ==

=== By structure ===
One traditional scheme for classifying [[English language|English]] sentences is by [[Sentence clause structure|clause structure]], the number and types of clauses in the sentence with finite verbs.
* A ''simple sentence'' consists of a single [[independent clause]] with no [[dependent clause]]s.
* A ''compound sentence'' consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent clauses. These clauses are joined together using [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], [[punctuation]], or both.
* A ''complex sentence'' consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
* A ''compound–complex sentence'' (or ''complex–compound sentence'') consists of multiple independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

=== By purpose&lt;!--linked from 'Statement' and 'Visibilités'--&gt;===
Sentences can also be classified based on their purpose:
* A ''declarative sentence'' or declaration, the most common type, commonly makes a statement: "I have to go to work."
* An ''interrogative sentence'' or [[question]] is commonly used to request information—"Do I have to go to work?"—but sometimes not; see [[rhetorical question]].
* An ''exclamatory sentence'' or exclamation is generally a more emphatic form of statement expressing emotion: "I have to go to work!"
* An ''imperative sentence'' or [[Imperative mood|command]] tells someone to do something (and if done strongly may be considered both imperative and exclamatory): "Go to work." or "Go to work!"
*An "instructive sentence" or instruction is used to provide information on what something is or how something can be done.

=== Major and minor sentences ===
A major sentence is a ''regular'' sentence; it has a subject and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], e.g. "I have a ball.". In this sentence, one can change the persons, e.g. "We have a ball.". However, a minor sentence is an irregular type of sentence that does not contain a main clause, e.g. "Mary!", "Precisely so.", "Next Tuesday evening after it gets dark.". Other examples of minor sentences are headings (e.g. the heading of this entry), stereotyped expressions ("Hello!"), emotional expressions ("Wow!"), proverbs, etc. These can also include [[nominal sentence]]s like "The more, the merrier". These mostly omit a main verb for the sake of conciseness, but may also do so in order to intensify the meaning around the nouns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/resources/resources/exp_lang/sentence.html Exploring Language: Sentences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005246/http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/resources/resources/exp_lang/sentence.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences that comprise a single word are called word sentences, and the words themselves [[sentence word]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections on Language and Language Learning|editor1=Marcel Bax |editor2=C. Jan-Wouter Zwart |editor3=A. J. van Essen |author=Jan Noordegraaf|pages=24|chapter=J. M. Hoogvliet as a teacher and theoretician|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=90-272-2584-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length ==
The 1980s saw a renewed surge in interest in sentence length, primarily in relation to "other syntactic phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eiUEh5OYgIC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bz7pTu_IE_CPiAehsP3nCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Quantitative Linguistics | year=1992 | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Těšitelová, Marie | pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition of the average sentence length of a prose passage is the ratio of the number of words to the number of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/lv7b7/language_log_on_twitter_and_real_trends_in_word/ | title=Calculate Average Sentence Length | publisher=Linguistics Forum | date=Jun 23, 2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}
The textbook ''Mathematical linguistics'', by András Kornai, suggests that in "journalistic prose the median sentence length is above 15 words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VCHgEpVXysC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Yj_pTvPuFuyUiQfKvdWFDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Mathematical linguistics | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Kornai, András | pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average length of a sentence generally serves as a measure of sentence difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Zw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=The assessment of sentence difficulty | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Perera, Katherine | pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, as the average sentence length increases, the complexity of the sentences also increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0KuDYr-lU0C&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jULpTo7UGqKjiAebq-HOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics%20history&amp;f=false | title=Instruction and assessment for struggling writers: evidence-based practices | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Troia, Gary A. | pages=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of "sentence length" is the number of clauses in the sentence, whereas the "clause length" is the number of [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] in the clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODC4ZTwn81wC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Quantitative Linguistics | year=2005 | accessdate=December 15, 2011 |author1=Reinhard Köhler |author2=Gabriel Altmann |author3=Raĭmond Genrikhovich Piotrovskiĭ | page=352 | quote=(Caption) Table 26.3: Sentence length (expressed by the number of clauses) and clause length (expressed by the number of phones) in a Turkish text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Erik Schils and Pieter de Haan by sampling five texts showed that two adjacent sentences are more likely to have similar lengths than two non-adjacent sentences, and almost certainly have a similar length when in a work of fiction. This countered the theory that "authors may aim at an alternation of long and short sentences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/20.abstract | title=Characteristics of Sentence Length in Running Text | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1993 | accessdate=December 12, 2011 |author1=Erik Schils |author2=Pieter de Haan }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sentence length, as well as word difficulty, are both factors in the readability of a sentence; however, other factors, such as the presence of conjunctions, have been said to "facilitate comprehension considerably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Zw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=The assessment of sentence difficulty | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Perera, Katherine | pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eer_Pg7ZAGAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Sentence Length, Sentence Complexity, and the Noun Phrase in 18th-Century News Publications | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Fries, Udo | pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SkELL''' is an abbreviation of [[Sketch Engine]] for Language Learning.&lt;ref name="raslan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baisa|first1=Vít|last2=Suchomel|first2=Vít|title=SkELL:Web Interface for English Language Learning|journal=Eighth Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2014|pages=63–70|url=https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/raslan14.pdf#page=71|publisher=NLP Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a web interface for language learning. The main purpose is to help students and teachers of languages. SkELL has its own [[Text corpus|corpus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eflnotes.wordpress.com/tag/james-thomas/ |title=Discovering English with SketchEngine – James Thomas interview |last=Thomas |first=James |publisher= |date=14 June 2015 |website=EFL NOTES |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was gathered so that contained texts covering everyday, standard, formal, and professional language.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt; In the corpus, there are a total of more than 60 million sentences and more than one billion words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/skell/ |title=SkELL |publisher=Lexical Computing Ltd. |date= |website=Sketch Engine |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SkELL interface provides features such as simple search showing words in context, but the maximum of displayed lines ([[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], in fact) is 40. However, the frequency of searched query is located below the search box and expressed with the number ''hits per million''. The second function is [[word sketch]] which enables showing collocates for a given word or words. The last one is named as similar words. It visualises similar words to searched word in a [[word cloud]].

The tool has been available also for the Russian language (since 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Valentina, A., Vitalevna, B. O., Малолетняя, А. П., Olga, K., &amp; Vit, B. (2016).

== Features ==
SkELL offers three types of searches.

* Examples – searching for words and phrases and their all derived forms
* Word sketch – a simplified version of the original word sketch page
* Similar words – based on the Distributional [[thesaurus]] in Sketch Engine, there are not necessarily	synonyms



== Data ==
The corpus for English SkELL consists of [[English Wikipedia]] (special sorted out 130,000 articles), English collection of [[Project Gutenberg]], a subset from the web corpus enTenTen14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš.|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|title=The tenten corpus family|journal=Seventh International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|date=July 2013|pages=125–127|url=|publisher=Lancaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whole [[British National Corpus]], and free new sources.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

=== Processing the data ===
After gathering and pre-cleaning (all structures have removed except sentences) data has run through processing pipe: normalization, [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], TreeTagger for English, and [[Data deduplication|deduplication]]. The further process was a compilation of the corpus using manatee indexing library. In the end, all sentences were scored with the GDEX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=A.|last2=Husák|first2=M.|last3=McAdam|first3=K.|last4=Rundell|first4=M.|last5=Rychlý|first5=P.|title=GDEX: Automatically finding good dictionary examples in a corpus|journal=Proceedings of the XIII EURALEX International Congress|date=July 2008|pages=425–432|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5040252|publisher=EURALEX}}&lt;/ref&gt; tool.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

In [[literary criticism]] and [[rhetoric]], a '''tautology''' is a statement which repeats the same idea, using near-synonymous morphemes, words, or phrases, that is, "saying the same thing twice".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tautology and [[pleonasm]] are not consistently differentiated in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Szymanek, "Remarks on Tautology in Word-Formation" in Laurie Bauer, ''et al.'', ''Semantics of Complex Words'', ''Studies in Morphology'' '''3''', 2015, {{isbn|3319141023}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLkPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 p. 142]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[pleonasm]], it is often considered a fault of [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] when unintentional. On the other hand, an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought, or help the listener or reader understand a point.&lt;ref name="bascom"&gt;John Bascom, ''Philosophy of Rhetoric'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y54CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes [[tautology (logic)|logical tautologies]] like "Boys will be boys" are conflated with language tautologies, but in general, a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true.&lt;ref name="bascom"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ("the same") plus λόγος ("word/idea"), and transmitted through 3rd-century Latin ''tautologia'' and French ''tautologie''. It first appears in English in the 16th century. The use in the term [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]] was introduced in English by [[Wittgenstein]] in 1919, perhaps following [[Auguste Comte]]'s usage in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2014, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/198205 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* "With malice toward none, with charity for all," from [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Ament, "Glossary of Rhetorical Terms" [https://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular, usually significant, fact about what is being discussed. For example, a [[gift]] is, by definition, free of charge; using the phrase "free gift" might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or [[fine print]], be it the expectation of money or reciprocation, or that the gift is being given by [[volition (psychology)|volition]].

This is related to the [[rhetoric]]al device of [[hendiadys]], where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases.  For example, "goblets and gold" meaning wealth, or "this day and age" meaning the present time. Superficially these expressions may seem tautological, but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea.

The use of tautologies is, however, usually unintentional. For example, the phrases "mental telepathy", "planned conspiracies", and "small dwarfs" imply that there are such things as "physical telepathy, spontaneous conspiracies, and giant dwarfs."&lt;ref name=Kallan&gt;{{cite book|last=Kallan|first=Richard|title=Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies|year=2005|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=0-375-42352-4|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] is not tautology, but rather a particular stylistic device. Much [[Old Testament]] [[poetry]] is based on [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]: the same thing said twice, but in slightly different ways (Fowler&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; puts it as [[pleonasm]]). However, modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines, such that they are usually not truly the "same thing." Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible: [[Psalms]], the [[Books of the Prophets]], and in other areas as well.

'''''The Interpreter''''' (2003) is [[Suki Kim]]’s first novel. In ''The Interpreter'', Kim creates a twenty-nine-year-old [[Korean American]] court interpreter named Suzy Park who makes a startling and ominous discovery during one court case which ultimately reveals the mystery of her parents' homicide. The award winning novel, mainly a murder mystery, breaks through the stereotypical images of the happy immigrant experience with a story of pain, loss, and murder.

==Plot summary==
Suzy Park is a young, attractive, and achingly alone Korean American woman who works as a [[legal translation|court interpreter]] for the [[New York City Courts|New York City court system]]. She has had two rocky relationships with married men, worked a series of unsatisfying jobs, and cut ties with her family before her parents were shot dead in an unsolved double murder. The life she has chosen as an interpreter is a reflection of Suzy's searching for her own identity and trying to bridge the two cultures to both of which she feels a detachment. During one court case she discovers that her parents were not murdered by random violence, as the police had indicated, but instead had been shot by political enemies. The discovery provides the glint of a new lead for Park, and the novel tracks her investigation into what really happened, which ultimately reveals the mystery of her parents' homicide.

'''The Khovansky Foundation''' ({{lang-ru|Фонд Хованского}}) is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in [[Voronezh]] in 1899. It is financed by funds ownership and donations from the citizens and associations.

== Мotto ==
The motto of the foundation are the words of [[Alexey Andreyevich Khovansky|A. A. Khovansky]]: ''“The treasure of knowledge is invaluable, it also has the distinction, that the one who donate it doesn't lose it, moreover, a donating hier is also an acquisition — with the growing level of public education grow those who donate it.”''.&lt;ref&gt;''Хованский А.А.'' [http://vrn-id.ru/filzaps98.htm  «Живое слово и живые факты»] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111104815/http://vrn-id.ru/filzaps98.htm |date=2013-11-11 }} // Филологические записки, Воронеж, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After the death of the publisher A. Khovansky (January 29, 1899)&lt;ref&gt;Voronezh encyclopedia, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was organized the Foundation and the Prize for the best teachers of filology and history.&lt;ref&gt;''Прядкин С.'' «Памяти А. А. Хованского» // «Филологические записки», Воронеж, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;''

In 1917, the Foundation and the magazine [[Filologicheskie Zapiski]] ceased its activities  almost for a century.

The Khovansky-fund was reconstituted on the occasion of the 110th anniversary (November 4, 2009), again with the aim to support teachers and publishers.
[[File:Xovansky bust1.jpg|thumb|80px|&lt;center&gt;Khovansky statuette]]
[[File:Xovansky medal0.jpg|80px|thumb|Khovansky medal]]

== Activities ==
The objective of the fund is to determine  in special  contest "The Living Word" the best teachers of languages and history  in order to provide material support to winners.

Another purpose of the Fund is to recognize a special annual premium for publishers.

The Foundation carries out research in the areas of: [[comparative linguistics]], [[comparative mythology]], [[local history]], [[ethnic]] and [[social psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[semiotics]].

== Merit Awards ==
The Foundation has established new merit awards in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Alexei Khovansky: medal "The Living Word" — for personal rewarding teachers of English and other languages and the statuette “Alexy” — for teaching and creative teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2013/03/06/reg-cfo/medal-anons.html В Воронеже учителей наградили медалями Хованского // Российская газета]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Living Word" medal has been awarded to several leading Russian academicians. In 2014, British translators Kit Bicket and Pascal Cissé became the first anglophone winners of the medal, for their work on a collection of essays on Russian and British heraldry and symbols ''[http://ru.calameo.com/read/00352398832835522121b The Semiotic Cycle: Signs of a Woman in Love]''. The collection was specially translated by the Khovansky Foundation as part of the 2014 UK/Russia Year of Culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="626">'''Usus''' ({{lang-la|usus}} — usage; long-established rule, practice, custom) is a term referring to the common usage of [[linguistic unit]]s (words, idioms, forms) in a particular speech community.

Usus can be contrasted with both occasional usage and prescribed [[standard language|standard usage]]. The term is used to designate usage that has wide currency and acceptance among speakers of a language, even if it diverges from the "high" literary standard. 

Usus is one of the crucial terms in the research of Danish linguists [[Otto Jespersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]].

[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]], with writing in three different scripts, was instrumental in deciphering Ancient Egyptian.]]

'''Writing''' is a medium of human [[communication]] that represents [[language]] and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or [[spoken language]]. Writing is not a language, but a [[tool]] used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]], and [[semantics]], with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called ''text'', and the recipient of text is called a ''reader''. Motivations for writing include [[publication]], [[storytelling]], correspondence, [[record keeping]] and [[diary]]. Writing has been instrumental in keeping [[history]], maintaining [[culture]], dissemination of knowledge through the [[Mass media|media]] and the formation of [[legal systems]].

As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in [[Mesopotamia]] outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}} In both [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.

== Means of recording information ==
[[H.G. Wells]] argued that writing has the ability to "put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =A Short History of the World |first=H. G. |last=Wells |year=1922 |page=41|title-link=A Short History of the World (H. G. Wells) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main article|Writing system}}
[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alphabet]]ic writing is a frequent category in [[human communication]]. ]]
The major [[writing system]]s—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories: [[logographic]], [[Syllable|syllabic]], [[alphabetic]], [[featural]], and [[ideographic]] (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, [[pictographic]], is insufficient to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.

====Logographies====
A [[logogram]] is a written character which represents a word or [[morpheme]]. A vast number of logograms are needed to write [[Chinese characters]], [[cuneiform]], and [[Mayan script|Mayan]], where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—("logoconsonantal" in the case of hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese "radicals", hieroglyphic "determiners"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for "fin", pronounced "ka", was also used to represent the syllable "ka" whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (meaning) element called a ''radical'' with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a ''phonetic''. However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.

The main logographic system in use today is [[Chinese characters]], used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of [[languages of China|China]], [[languages of Japan|Japan]], and sometimes in [[Korean language|Korean]] despite the fact that in [[South Korea|South]] and [[North Korea]], the phonetic [[Hangul]] system is mainly used.

====Syllabaries====
A [[syllabary]] is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s. A glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel, or just a vowel alone, though in some scripts more complex syllables (such as consonant-vowel-consonant, or consonant-consonant-vowel) may have dedicated glyphs. Phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script. For instance, the syllable "ka" may look nothing like the syllable "ki", nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. Other languages that use syllabic writing include the [[Linear B]] script for [[Mycenaean Greek]]; [[Cherokee]]; [[Ndyuka language|Ndjuka]], an English-based [[creole language]] of [[Surinam]]; and the [[Vai language|Vai]] script of [[Liberia]]. Most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component. [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]], though technically an [[abugida]], has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary.

====Alphabets====
{{See also|History of the alphabet}}

An [[alphabet]] is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly [[phonology|phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.

As languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

=====Abjads=====
In most of the writing systems of the Middle East, it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written, although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks. Writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Such systems are called ''[[abjad]]s'', derived from the Arabic word for "alphabet".

=====Abugidas=====
In most of the alphabets of India and Southeast Asia, vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant. These are called ''[[abugida]]s''. Some abugidas, such as [[Ethiopic]] and [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree]], are learned by children as syllabaries, and so are often called "syllabics". However, unlike true syllabaries, there is not an independent glyph for each syllable.

Sometimes the term "alphabet" is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels, such as the [[Latin alphabet]], although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets. Because of this use, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] is often considered to be the first alphabet.

====Featural scripts====
A featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips ("labial" sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters "b" and "p"; however, labial "m" is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking "q" and "d" are not labial. In Korean [[hangul]], however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed.

Another featural script is [[SignWriting]], the most popular writing system for many [[sign languages]], where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented [[secular icon|iconically]]. Featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tengwar]].

====Historical significance of writing systems====
[[Image:Olin-Warner-LoC-tympanum-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] representing Writing, above exterior of main entrance doors, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington DC, 1896.]]

Historians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history, with history defined by the advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing, but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.

Writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation, and meaning of individual signs changes over time. By tracing the development of a script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time.

===Tools and materials===
{{See also|writing implements}}
The many tools and writing materials used throughout history include [[stone tablet]]s, [[clay tablet]]s, bamboo slats, [[papyrus]], [[wax tablet]]s, [[vellum]], [[parchment]], [[paper]], [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], [[stylus]]es, [[quill]]s, [[ink brush]]es, [[pencil]]s, [[pen]]s, and many styles of [[lithography]]. The Incas used knotted cords known as [[quipu]] (or khipu) for keeping records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/index.html|title=The Khipu Database Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[typewriter]] and various forms of [[word processor]]s have subsequently become widespread writing tools, and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
{{Main article|Proto-writing|History of writing}}

===Neolithic writing===
[[File:Tărtăria Amulet.png|thumb|250px|Amulet of the [[Tărtăria tablets]], the earliest found example of the [[Old European script]] and of human writing in the world generally, dating to 5500–5300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, Harald (2002). ''Geschichte der Schrift'', C.H. Beck, {{ISBN|3-406-47998-7}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is a product of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] that was in [[Romania]] and neighbouring regions.]]

By definition, the modern practice of [[history]] begins with written records. Evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of [[prehistory]]. The [[Dispilio Tablet]] (Greece), [[Jiahu symbols]] (China) and [[Tărtăria tablets]] (Romania), which have been carbon dated to the [[6th millennium BC]], are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings.

===Mesopotamia===
While neolithic writing is a current research topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East. Writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining financial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}}

[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Globular envelope with a cluster of accountancy tokens, Uruk period, from [[Susa]]. [[Louvre Museum]]]]

Archaeologist [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat]] determined the link between previously uncategorized clay "tokens", the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, [[Mesopotamian]] [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref name="Rudgley"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age| last=Rudgley| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Rudgley| year=2000| pages=48–57| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added "a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols".

The original [[Mesopotamian]] writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing, Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' pp. 381–383&lt;/ref&gt; the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers. This system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of [[pictographs]]. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but by the 29th century BC also for phonetic elements. Around 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonia]]n) around 2600 BC, and then to others such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]. With the adoption of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as the 'lingua franca' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.

===Elamite scripts===
Over the centuries, three distinct Elamite scripts developed.
[[Proto-Elamite]] is the oldest known writing system from Iran. In use only for a brief time (c. 3200–2900 BC), clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is thought to have developed from early [[cuneiform]] (proto-cuneiform). The Proto-Elamite script consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly [[logogram|logographic]].

[[Linear Elamite]] is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in Iran. It was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, although this cannot be proven since Linear-Elamite has not been deciphered. Several scholars have attempted to decipher the script, most notably [[:de:Walther Hinz|Walther Hinz]] and [[:it:Piero Meriggi|Piero Meriggi]].

The [[Elamite cuneiform]] script was used from about 2500 to 331 BC, and was adapted from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]. The Elamite cuneiform script consisted of about 130 symbols, far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts.

====Cretan and Greek scripts====
{{Further information|Cretan hieroglyphs|Linear A|Linear B}}

[[Cretan hieroglyphs]] are found on artifacts of [[Crete]] (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). [[Linear B]], the writing system of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]],&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."/&gt; has been deciphered while [[Linear A]] has yet to be deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."&gt;{{harvnb|Olivier|1986|pp=377f.}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name group="A"&gt;Beginning date refers to first attestations, the assumed origins of all scripts lie further back in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the [[Aegean Islands]] ([[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Cythera (island)|Kythera]], [[Milos|Melos]], [[Santorini|Thera]]), and the [[Greek mainland]] ([[Laconia]]) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete ([[Knossos]]), and mainland ([[Pylos]], [[Mycenae]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tiryns]]) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.

===China===
{{Further information|Oracle bone script|Bronzeware script}}

The earliest surviving examples of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called "[[oracle bone]]s", tortoise [[plastron]]s and ox [[scapula]]e used for divination—date from around 1200 BC in the late [[Shang dynasty]]. A small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2003, archaeologists reported discoveries of [[Jiahu symbols|isolated tortoise-shell carvings]] dating back to the 7th millennium BC, but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|196px|thumbnail|right|[[Narmer Palette]], with the two serpopards representing unification of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], [[3000 B.C.|3000 B. C.]]]]
The earliest known [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are the [[Narmer Palette]], dating to c. 3200 BC, and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older, though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition. The hieroglyphic script was [[logogram|logographic]] with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|alphabet]].

Writing was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of [[scribe]]s. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.

The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] appears to have been developed by Canaanite turquoise miners in the Sinai desert around the mid-19th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwasser, Orly. "How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs", Biblical Archaeology Review, Mar/Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous Egyptian mining site known as Serabit el-Khadem. This site was also home to a temple of Hathor, the "Mistress of turquoise". A later, two line inscription has also been found at Wadi el-Hol in Central Egypt. Based on [[hieroglyph]]ic prototypes, but also including entirely new symbols, each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word: the basis of an alphabetic system. It was not until the 12th to 9th centuries, however, that the alphabet took hold and became widely used.

===Indus Valley===
{{Main article|Indus script}}

Indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (which spanned modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]]) used between 2600 and 1900 BC. In spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims, it is as yet undeciphered. The term 'Indus script' is mainly applied to that used in the mature Harappan phase, which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early [[Harappa]] after 3500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, David (1999). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm 'Earliest writing' found]" BBC&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by the mature Harappan script. The script is written from right to left,&lt;ref&gt;(Lal 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes follows a [[boustrophedonic]] style. Since the number of principal signs is about 400–600,&lt;ref&gt;(Wells 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts, many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic&lt;ref&gt;(Bryant 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically syllabic scripts have about 50–100 signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs). Several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an [[agglutinative]] language underlies the script.

===Central Asia===
In 2001, archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in [[Central Asia]] that used writing c. 2000 BC. An excavation near [[Ashgabat]], the capital of [[Turkmenistan]], revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient writing found in Turkmenistan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1330705.stm |quote=A previously unknown civilisation was using writing in Central Asia 4,000 years ago, hundreds of years before Chinese writing developed, archaeologists have discovered.

===Phoenician writing system and descendants===
The [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script, in which [[Proto-Canaanite]] is believed to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The [[Phoenician script|Phoenician writing system]] was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from [[Hieratic]], [[Cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. This writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greeks]], who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The [[Cumae alphabet]], a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and its own descendants, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Rune]]s. Other descendants from the [[Greek alphabet]] include [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used to write [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the [[Aramaic script]], from which the [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic script]]s are descended.

The [[Tifinagh]] script (Berber languages) is descended from the Libyco-Berber script, which is assumed to be of Phoenician origin.

===Mesoamerica===
A stone slab with 3,000-year-old writing, known as the [[Cascajal Block]], was discovered in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]] and is an example of the oldest script in the Western Hemisphere, preceding the oldest [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] writing by approximately 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |authorlink=John Noble Wilford |title=Writing May Be Oldest in Western Hemisphere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/15writing.html |quote=A stone slab bearing 3,000-year-old writing previously unknown to scholars has been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and archaeologists say it is an example of the oldest script ever discovered in the Western Hemisphere. |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Briggs |title='Oldest' New World writing found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5347080.stm |quote=Ancient civilisations in Mexico developed a writing system as early as 900 BC, new evidence suggests. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oldest Writing in the New World |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5793/1610 |first=Maria del Carmen |last=Rodríguez Martínez |display-authors=etal |year=2006 |volume=313 |issue=5793 |pages=1610–1614 |doi=10.1126/science.1131492 |pmid=16973873 |quote=A block with a hitherto unknown system of writing has been found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico.

Of several [[pre-Columbian]] scripts in [[Mesoamerica]], the one that appears to have been best developed, and the only one to be deciphered, is the [[Maya script]]. The earliest inscription identified as Maya dates to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Saturno2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saturno|first=William A.|author2=David Stuart |author3=Boris Beltrán |title=Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala|journal=Science|date=3 March 2006|volume=311|issue=5765|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1126/science.1121745|pmid=16400112|bibcode=2006Sci...311.1281S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya writing used logograms complemented by a set of syllabic glyphs, somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing.

===South America===
The [[Incas]] had no known script. Their [[quipu]] system of recording information—based on knots tied along one or many linked cords—was apparently used for inventory and accountancy purposes and could not encode textual information.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Dacia===
Three stone slabs were found by Romanian archaeologist [[Nicolae Vlassa]], in the mid-20th century (1961) in [[Tărtăria]] (present-day [[Alba County]], [[Transylvania]]), [[Romania]], ancient land of [[Dacia]], inhabited by Dacians, which were a population who may have been related to the [[Getae]]s and [[Thracians]].
One of the slabs contains 4 groups of pictographs divided by lines. Some of the characters are also found in Ancient [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], as well as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] and [[Iberian scripts|Iberian]].
The origin and the timing of the writings are disputed, because there are no precise evidence [[in situ]], the slabs cannot be carbon dated, because of the bad treatment of the [[Cluj]] museum. There are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs, that certifies the 5300–5500 BC period.

==Modern importance==
In the 21st century, writing has become an important part of daily life as [[technology]] has connected individuals from across the globe through systems such as [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. [[Literacy]] has grown in importance as a factor for success in the modern world. In the United States, the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the [[writing center]] and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their [[socioeconomic status]].

Other parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the [[World Literacy Foundation]] and [[International Literacy Foundation]], as well as a general push for increased global communication.

'''ǂKxʼao-ǁʼae'''{{pronunciation?}} (ǂKxʼauǁʼein{{pronunciation?}}, Auen, Kaukau) is a southeastern variety of the [[ǃKung language|!Xuun]] [[dialect continuum]], spoken in [[Botswana]] (the settlements of [[Groote Laagte]], [[East Hanahai]], Kanagas and [[Ghanzi]] in [[Ghanzi District]] and on the commercial farms) and in [[Namibia]] (the city of [[Gobabis]] and settlements along the C22 road to [[Otjinene]] as far as [[Eiseb]], [[Omaheke Region]]) by about 7,000 people. In Botswana, most speakers are bilingual in [[Naro language|Naro]] or [[Tswana language|Tswana]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

There are numerous spellings of the name, including ''ǁAuǁei, ǁX’auǁ’e,'' and ''Auen''. Endonyms are ''Juǀʼhoan, ǃXuun ''in Namibia and ''ǂKx'ao||'ae'' (predominantly in Botswana) meaning "northern people" in Naro. It also goes by the names ''Gobabis ǃKung'' and ''Kaukau ''(which can take the noun class prefixes in [[Tswana language|Tswana]] to give ''Mokaukau ''for one person, ''Bakaukau'' for the group and ''Sekaukau'' for the language).

In Namibia, ǂKx'ao||'ae'' ''tends to refer literally to the !Xuun speakers to the north in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi area]]. With the exception of a few cultural traits, speakers of ǂKx'ao||'ae'' ''in Botswana and those of Ju|'hoan in Namibia argue that they are one and the same people, speaking one language, with some dialectal attributes.

The non-Latin characters used by the language predominantly refer to [[click consonants]] and follow the orthography by Patrick Dickens for [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Juǀ'hoan]].

The limited data on these dialects is poorly transcribed, but as of 2015 fieldwork is in progress.
