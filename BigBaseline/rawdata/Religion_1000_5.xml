The '''2004 Quetta Ashura massacre''' is the [[sectarian]] [[terrorist attack]] on Tuesday 2 March 2004 during an [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] procession in southwestern city of [[Quetta]], in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]]. At least 42 persons were killed and more than 100 wounded in the attack.&lt;ref name="BBCnews11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3524851.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Carnage in Pakistan Shia attack |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archivedate=28 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228103841/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3524851.stm |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack took place in Liaqat [[Bazaar]] Quetta, almost all of the victims were from [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic minority of Balochistan. The incident occurred just after the incident of [[Iraq Ashura bombings|Karbala Ashura bombings]] in [[Iraq]].

==Background==
The [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim|Muslim's]] processions are held throughout [[List of Muslim-majority countries|world]] to commemorate the [[Shahid|martyrdom]] of [[Hussein ibn Ali|Imam Hussain Ibn Ali]] every year on the [[Day of Ashura]].&lt;ref name="BBCnews11"/&gt; Like other parts of [[Pakistan]], [[Quetta]] city has a notable population of Shia Muslims who mainly belong to [[Hazara people|Hazara community]]. In Quetta, the Ashura procession starts from [[Mehr Abad|Alamdar Road]], where all the [[Hussainia|Imambargahs]] gather from around the city mainly from [[Hazara Town]], then the procession moves to Mezan Chowk, where [[Ibadah|prayers]] are offered, and [[Mourning of Muharram|Matam]] was performed then moves to Liaqat Bazaar and ends on Alamdar Road.

==Massacre==
The [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] procession was on its traditional route, when it reached the main [[Bazaar]], three terrorist from top a building, threw [[Grenade|hand grenades]] followed by firing with automatic weapons before they blew themselves up, which left around 50 dead and more 100 injured.&lt;ref name="BBCnews11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Terrorism, By: Leonard Weinberg. p 213.

NY&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3527697.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Pakistan probes assault on Shias |work=BBC News |date=3 March 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archivedate=23 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123174922/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3527697.stm |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perpetrators===
The police identified the assailants bodies after DNA tests and investigations. They belonged to [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi|Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ)]], the banned [[Pakistani]] [[terrorist group]]. The [[Balochistan Police|Police]] arrested a police constable who allegedly allowed the terrorist to use his house to plan the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-5-2004_pg7_10 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |newspaper=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |date=17 May 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archivedate=12 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212205311/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-5-2004_pg7_10 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
A mass funeral was arranged the next day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Response and reactions==
[[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] condemned the attacks and named it a ''cowardly'' act.&lt;ref name="DawnNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/04/top16.htm |title=Ashura day attacks condemned world wide |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn News]] |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archivedate=24 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124005958/http://archives.dawn.com/2004/03/04/top16.htm |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The, Secretary-General of [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)]], Abdulwahed Belkeziz said&lt;ref name="DawnNews"/&gt; {{quote|''Such terrorist acts can only be designed to incite sectarian (Sunni-Shia) strife and infighting among Muslims and to shed their blood.''}}

The Embassy of Japan in [[Islamabad]] issued a press release&lt;ref name="DawnNews"/&gt; {{quote|''Japan is deeply shocked and angered by the terrorist bombings in Baghdad and Karbala, Iraq, and the attacks in Quetta that occurred on Tuesday, causing many deaths and injuries. Terrorism cannot be justified on any account. Japan reiterates its firm condemnation of brutal terrorist attacks, which victimize the innocent. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the victims and the bereaved and wish the injured will have a speedy recovery.}}

[[Ministry of Interior (Pakistan)|Interior Minister of Pakistan]], [[Faisal Saleh Hayat]] condemned the attack and said&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; {{quote|''These misguided extremists want to create chaos in the country.''}}

The '''''ATLA Religion Database''''' ('''''ATLA RDB''''') is an index of [[academic journal]] articles in the area of [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Finding"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Golderman |first1=Gail |last2=Connolly |first2=Bruce |journal=[[Library Journal]] |title=Finding Religion |date=April 15, 2011 |volume=136 |issue=7 |pages=120–126.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is updated monthly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atla.com/about/pressroom/Pages/ATLA%20Announces%20Monthly%20Updates%20and%20Major%20Product%20Enhancements.aspx|title=ATLA Announces Monthly Updates and Major Product Enhancements|website=www.atla.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by the [[American Theological Library Association]] (ATLA). The database indexes articles, [[essay]]s, and [[book review]]s related to a wide range of scholarly fields related to religion. The database is available on a subscription basis through a database aggregator.

The total database includes over 2.1 million article citations from over 1,940+ journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atla.com/products/prodinfo/Pages/ATLA-RDB.aspx|title=ATLA Religion Database® (ATLA RDB®)|website=www.atla.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than a quarter of a million essay citations from more than 18,000 multi-author works.

== Formats ==
The ''ATLA Religion Database'', formerly available on CD-ROM, is a [[MARC standards|MARC record format]] database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=American Theological Library Association Summary of Proceedings |last1=Luedtke |first1=Tami |year=1998 |publisher= American Theological Library Association |booktitle= |pages=243–246 |issn= 0066-0868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that incorporates several out-of-print indexes, including [[Religion Index One: Periodicals]], [[Religion Index Two: Multi-Author Works]], and [[Index to Book Reviews in Religion]].&lt;ref name="Finding" /&gt;

== Coverage ==
The database indexes scholarly works on [[major world religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=World Religions/Religious Studies in ATLA's RDB |last=Campbell |first=Cameron J. |conference=American Theological Library Association Summary of Proceedings |year=2004 |pages=85–89 |issn=0066-0868}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, selection criteria for inclusion according to scholarly merit and scope. More than 60 languages are represented. Some records cover articles as far back as the 19th century. ATLA claims full coverage for core journals back to 1949.

In the 1990s, ''ATLA RDB'' received criticism in a masters thesis for under-representing the emerging fields of [[lesbian theology]] and [[womanist theology]] in its coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Smailes |first=Suzanne A. |title=Reliability of Coverage of Periodical Indexing of Lesbian Theological and Womanist Theological Articles in the ATLA Religion Database |date=May 1996 |publisher=[[Kent State University]] |degree=Master of Library Science |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED401940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W. Michael Ashcraft, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J. Gordon Melton]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=107}}

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1340">'''Ahöla''', also known as '''Ahul''',  is a spirit being, a [[kachina]], embodied by a man, in [[Hopi religion]].

Ahöla is one of the important chief katsinam for [[First Mesa, Arizona|First and Second Mesas]], in [[Hopi]], because he opens the mid-winter Powamu ceremony, sometimes called the bean planting festival. On the first night of the festival, he performs inside a [[kiva]], the subterranean, ceremonial space, before going with the Powamu Chief to give prayer feathers to Kachina Spring at dawn. Afterwards, Ahöla and the Powamu Chief visit all of the kivas and ceremonial houses, giving out bean and corn plants and marking the doorways with stripes of cornmeal. At the end of the ceremony, Ahöla descends to a shrine, bows four times to the Sun, and asks for health, happiness, long life, and good crops. Ahöla is also the friend of Eototo, and one legend tells of 
Ahöla having his throat cut to let Eototo to escape.

[[File:ARO Plate 2 (Title page alternate).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|One of two known impressions of the title page from ''All Religions are One'', printed ''c''1795]]
'''''All Religions are One''''' is a series of philosophical [[aphorism]]s by [[William Blake]], written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with [[William Blake#Relief etching|relief etching]] in the non-textual ''[[The Approach of Doom]]'' (1787), ''All Religions are One'' and ''[[There is No Natural Religion]]'' represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his [[illuminated manuscript]]s. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as [[Peter Ackroyd]] points out, "his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words [[Epigraphy|inscribed]] like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role."&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 115–16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relief etching==
[[File:The Ghost of Abel (page 2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|left|Page 2 of ''The Ghost of Abel'' (1822); note the writing in the colophon at bottom right.]]
In 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled ''[[The Ghost of Abel|The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake]]''. Inscribed in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] of this text is "W Blakes Original [[Stereotype (printing)|Stereotype]] was 1788". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the "Original Stereotype" to which he here refers was ''All Religions are One'' and/or ''There is No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bindman (1978: 468), Erdman (1982: 790); Ackroyd (1995: 115)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would [[Engraving|engrave]] it (the engraver), another [[Printing|print]] it (the printer) and another [[Publishing|publish]] it (the publisher).&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 10)&lt;/ref&gt; It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the [[social status]] attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; Artists like [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]] and [[John Hamilton Mortimer]] were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 10)"/&gt; A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with [[James Basire]] during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was [[stippling]], which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, [[line engraving]]. [[Etching]] was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (1978: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; All traditional methods of engraving and etching were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]], which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a [[burin (engraving)|burin]] to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of [[Hatching|crosshatched lines]], before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 37)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''. Around the same time, [[George Cumberland]] had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern [[rubber stamp]]. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;The exact method is described in great detail in Joseph Viscomi, ''Blake and the Idea of the Book'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 4 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio.&lt;ref&gt;See Bindman (1978), Bindman (2000) and Viscomi (2003) for more specific information.&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he [[Mirror writing|wrote in reverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Viscomi (2003: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 13)"/&gt;

Blake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire ''oeuvre'' are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.

Blake himself referred to relief etching as "printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790); Plate 6&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, [[John Thomas Smith (engraver)|J.T. Smith]]; "writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with [[Nitric acid|aquafortis]] considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief etching was the same basic method used for [[woodcut]]ting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by [[Elisha Kirkall]], but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"&gt;Bindman (1978: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required.&lt;ref&gt;Bindman (2000: 7)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; "it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 9)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake served as artist, engraver, printer ''and'' publisher.

==Copy==
Although ''All Religions are One'' was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed ''All Religions'' prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion'', would suggest he had not.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003052150/http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=aro&amp;java=yes |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 October 2006 |title=Introduction |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=[[William Blake Archive]] |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copy A is located in [[Huntington Library|The Huntington Library]], except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the [[Geoffrey Keynes]] Collection in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

''All Religions are One'' comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4&amp;nbsp;cm.,&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 21)&lt;/ref&gt; with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and [[Wash (painting)|wash]], often touching the text and design outlines with pen.&lt;ref name="Bindman 1978: 14"/&gt; Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of [[Woodcut#White-line woodcut|white line engraving]], a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.

The black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to [[John Linnell]]. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain.&lt;ref name="ARO Intro" /&gt; It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27&amp;nbsp;cm.).&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt;
 
Plates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from ''There is No Natural Religion''. The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to [[Henry E. Huntington]]. Plate 2 was acquired by [[George A. Smith]] in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by [[William Muir]], but was ultimately sold at [[Sotheby's]] by Sir [[Hickman Bacon]] on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/copy/aro.a |title=Copy Information |author= |date= |work=All Religions are One |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original 1795 printing, the text of ''All Religions'' was not published again until 1893, in ''The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical'', edited by [[W. B. Yeats|W.B. Yeats]] and [[Edwin Ellis (poet)|E.J. Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;Keynes (1966: 886)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Until 1971, most editors tended to consider ''All Religions are One'' as later than ''There is No Natural Religion''. For example, in his 1905 book ''The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals'', [[John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson]] places ''No Natural Religion'' prior to ''All Religions'' in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that ''All Religions are One'' was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its "greater technical imperfection."&lt;ref name="Erdman (1982: 789)"&gt;Erdman (1982: 789)&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1978 book, ''The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake'', David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in ''All Religions'' are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref name="Bindman (1978: 468)"&gt;Bindman (1978: 468)&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars however support Keynes, and ''All Religions are One'' precedes ''There is No Natural Religion'' in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, [[Alicia Ostriker]]'s ''William Blake: The Complete Poems'' (1977), [[David V. Erdman]]'s 2nd edition of ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's ''Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books'' (1993), even Bindman's own ''The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake'' (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of ''Blake: The Complete Poems'' (2007).

Further evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of ''No Natural Religion'' as more confident than that of ''All Religions''. They especially cite the use of upright [[Latin alphabet|roman lettering]] in ''All Religions'' contrasted with the [[Italic script|italic]], [[cursive]] writing on several plates of ''No Natural Religion''; "this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 12)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of ''No Natural Religion'', a script which he would use throughout the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; Other evidence for an earlier dating of ''All Religions'' is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in ''No Natural Religion''. This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in ''All Religions'' but not ''No Natural Religion'' suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.

==Content==
When analysing ''All Religions are One'' it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; "the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal."&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake would go on to criticise the ten commandments in later work such as ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1790), ''[[The Book of Urizen]]'' (1794), ''[[The Book of Los]]'' (1795) and ''[[The Song of Los]]'' (1795), and that same critical inclination seems present here as he quite literally effaces the content of the original tablets, replacing it with his own doctrine. However, it is also worth noting that the angel embraces the man with his left hand and the tablets with his right, thus suggesting a spiritual union between the man of prophecy (Blake himself) and the foundational text of orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 34)"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The central concern in ''All Religions are One'' is the notion of the "Poetic Genius", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and "is the true man." The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as "The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel &amp; Spirit &amp; Demon." Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; "as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius." Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; "all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; "the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy," again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; "The Jewish &amp; Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius." Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.

David Bindman classifies ''All Religions are One'' as "a rather abstract dialogue with conventional [[theology]],"&lt;ref&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with [[deism]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ostriker (1977: 877), Bindman (1978: 468), Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894) or Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Northrop Frye]] argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a "visionary tolerance" at odds with the "rational tolerance" of deism "which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 345)&lt;/ref&gt; Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake "set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sandler (1990: 43)&lt;/ref&gt; Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a "mockery of [[rationalism]] and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude."&lt;ref&gt;Ostriker (1977: 877)&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Foster Damon]] suggests that what Blake has done in ''All Religions are One'' is "dethroned [[reason]] from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 343)&lt;/ref&gt; Damon also argues that "Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions."&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the "primacy of the poetic imagination over all [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and moral systems."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, "Commentary" in Erdman (1982: 894)&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that "the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or "[[Natural theology|natural religion]]", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or "Poetic Genius"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/staticpage/biography?p=biography |title= Illuminated Printing and other Illustrated Books, 1789-1792 |author= Denise Vultee  |date= |work=William Blake (1757-1827) |publisher=The William Blake Archive |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 [[Henry Fuseli]] was working on a translation of [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|J.C. Lavater]]'s ''[[Aphorisms on Man]]'' for the publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them.&lt;ref&gt;Ackroyd (1995: 107)&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of ''Aphorisms'', and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both ''All Religions'' and ''No Natural Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Hilton (2003: 195)&lt;/ref&gt; S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;&lt;ref&gt;Damon (1988: 16–17)&lt;/ref&gt;

# Know, in the first place, that mankind agree in essence, as they do in their limbs and senses.
# Mankind differ as much in essence as they do in form, limbs, and senses – and only so, and not more".

To these points Blake has annotated "This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction."

Another work which may also have influenced him is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word "Lord" with "Poetic Genius". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes "He who Loves feels love descend into him &amp; if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord." Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's "the negation of God constitutes Hell", Blake annotates "the negation of the Poetic Genius."&lt;ref&gt;Both quotations taken from Erdman (1982: 603)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated ''The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds'', Blake wrote

{{quote|[[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Treatise on the Sublime &amp; Beautiful]] is founded on the Opinions of Newton &amp; Locke on this Treatise Reynolds has grounded many of his assertions. in all his Discourses I read Burkes Treatise when very Young at the same time I read Locke on [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Human Understanding]] &amp; Bacons [[The Advancement of Learning|Advancement of Learning]] on Every one of these Books I wrote my Opinions &amp; on looking them over find that my Notes on Reynolds in this Book are exactly Similar. I felt the Same Contempt &amp; Abhorrence then; that I do now. They mock Inspiration &amp; Vision Inspiration &amp; Vision was then &amp; now is &amp; I hope will always Remain my Element my Eternal Dwelling place. how can I then hear it Contemnd without returning Scorn for Scorn}}

Harold Bloom also cites the work of [[Anthony Collins]], [[Matthew Tindal]] and [[John Toland]] as having an influence on Blake's thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Blake's Apocalypse'' (Garden City: Doubleday,  1963), 25&lt;/ref&gt; In a more general sense, "Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"&gt;Eaves ''et al.'' (1993: 27)&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Blake "manipulates the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] mythology of [[Jacob Bryant]], [[Paul Henri Mallet]], and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 27)"/&gt;

In relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees ''All Religions are One'' and ''There is No Natural Religion'' as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, "a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon."&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1947: 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they "contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art."&lt;ref name="Eaves ''et al'' (1993: 21)"/&gt; W.H. Stevenson calls them "a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (2007: 55)&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of ''All Religions'', in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' (1790), he writes "the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative" (12:22–24).

An '''annual cycle''' refers to a set of changes or events that uniformly, or consistently, take place at the same time of year.

In [[biology]], the annual cycle for plants and animals details behavioral and chemical changes that take place as the seasons advance.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, John M. and Houston, Alasdair I. (2008) "Introduction: Adaptation to the annual cycle" ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences'' 363(1490):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;209–210&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]], a [[business cycle]] refers to the way modelling and analysis is applied to the periodic development and marketing of new products and services.

In [[religion]], the annual cycle refers to the various celebrations or memorials that occur in the same sequence from year to year. For example, in [[Christianity]] the [[liturgical year]] is an annual cycle, which for some [[Christian denomination]]s is composed of the ''temporal cycle'' that tracks the events in the life of [[Christ]], and the ''sanctoral cycle'' which tracks the various saint's days. Some Christian churches only observe the ''temporal cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;Flesher, Paul [http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm "Christian Time and Worship"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309191604/http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/religionet/er/christ/ctime.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }} ''Exploring Religions'' University of Wyoming&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climatology]], an annual cycle is the part of a measured quantity's fluctuation that is attributed to Earth's changing position in [[orbit]] over the course of the year.  Such quantities might be influenced directly (e.g. incoming [[solar radiation]] at a point at the surface) or indirectly (e.g. [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[westerlies]] and [[polar easterlies|easterlies]] over the winter and summer hemispheres, respectively) by orbital position.

Mathematically, the climatological annual cycle is commonly estimated from observational data or model output by taking the average of all Januaries, all Februaries, and so forth. If the observational record is long enough and conditions are stationary (i.e. there is no significant long-term trend), a meaningful annual cycle will result that can be used to calculate an [[anomaly time series]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9058">The '''argument from a proper basis''' is an [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] related to [[fideism]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] argued that belief in God is a properly [[basic belief]], and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Origins.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225232043/http://origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html |date=2005-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alvin Plantinga==

The best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and, owing to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called "Proper functionalism", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour]], [[William Alston]], and [[Alvin Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls "warrant"—what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second book of his three book philosophical series, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.&lt;ref&gt;
Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's "proper function" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's "belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers" are functioning properly—"working the way it ought to work".&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a "design plan", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: "it is perhaps possible that [[Evolution (term) | evolution]] (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans",&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;WPF, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as "naturalistic", including the "functional generalization" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 199-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the "A/C" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the "Extended A/C" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation, etc.{{huh?|date=January 2017}} can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

==Objections==

===The Great Pumpkin Objection===

The best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as '[[The Great Pumpkin]] Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', and described it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that [[the Great Pumpkin]] returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Rebuttal====

Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for "proper basicality" propounded by [[Foundationalism#Classical foundationalism|classical foundationalism]] (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector "knows" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a  "pivotal age" characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

Then, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the [[first millennium BC]] has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''&lt;ref name="Jaspers"&gt;Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0415578806}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].&lt;ref name="Metzler2009" /&gt; Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).&lt;ref name="Metzler2009"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Metzler|first1=Dieter

Jasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K.,''The Origin and Goal of History'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that during the Axial Age, "the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers – [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]], – of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".&lt;ref name="Jaspers51"&gt;{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.&lt;ref name = "Thomassen"&gt;{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | authorlink= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | url= http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | authorlink = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = NewYork|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thinkers and movements==
[[Parshvanatha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Mary Pat | title =Living Religions: An Encyclopedia of the World's Faiths | publisher = IB Tauris | year =1997 | location = London | isbn = 1-86064-148-2 | page = 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title =Parshvanatha  | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica  | volume = Online  | year =2007  | url =http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9058576  | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (23rd Tirthankara in the 9th century BCE) and [[Mahavira]] (24th [[Tirthankara]] in the 6th century BCE), known as the [[fordmaker]]s of [[Jainism]] lived during this age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Mahavira | title = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Answers | date = 28 Nov 2009 | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/mahavira | title = Mahavira}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They propagated the religion of [[sramana]]s (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced [[Indian philosophy]] by propounding the principles of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Karma in Jainism|karma]],  [[samsara]] and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first = Robert J | authorlink = Robert J. Zydenbos | title = Jainism Today and Its Future | publisher = Manya Verlag | year =2006 | location = München | url =http://www.manyaverlag.de/jtaif.html | pages = 11, 56–57, 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.&lt;ref name = "Boyce1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | authorlink = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of [[Zoroaster]]'s life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name= "Boyce1979" /&gt; Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name = "Malandra1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W. Malandra|title=An Introduction to Ancient Iranian Religion|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location= Minneapolis|year=1983|isbn = 0-8166-1114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name = "B.A. Brown 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Brian Arthur | authorlink = Brian Arthur Brown | title = Three Testaments: Torah, Gospel, and Quran | publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location= Lanham, MD | year= 2012 | pages = 23–24 | isbn = 978-1-4422-1492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name = "Voegelin1985"&gt;{{cite book| last= Voegelin|first= Eric|authorlink= Eric Voegelin| series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, [[Missouri|MO]] | publisher = The University of Missouri Press| year= 2000| origyear= 1985| isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | publication-date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."&lt;ref name = "Graeber"&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an "ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] played an important role in Jaspers' thinking.&lt;ref name= "Stanford"&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title = Karl Jaspers | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ | accessdate= 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Szakolczai"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2003 | title=The Genesis of Modernity | edition= First hardcover | publisher =Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-25305-5 | pages=80–81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415253055&amp;id=hGduSwFHFSEC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+characteristics&amp;sig=O9S_5-pSxgMIPz8Ocn8RrgofkPU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "EoST"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2006 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory | chapter = Historical sociology | publisher = Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-29046-5|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415290465&amp;id=LrBrWXtez8YC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;vq=Axial+Age&amp;dq=%22The+Axial+Age:+The+Emergence+of+Transcendental+Visions+and+the+Rise+of+Clerics%22&amp;sig=g0mBSYAPnOEiXYGHR-j8hpuQPVM | page = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] argues in the introduction to ''The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations'' that Weber's work in his ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with [[Eric Voegelin]]'s ''Order and History''.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt" /&gt; Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus]]'' in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason.&lt;ref name = "EoST" /&gt; In literature, [[Gore Vidal]] in his novel [[Creation (novel)|''Creation'']] covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

[[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsUKbgh_A1YC|title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438401942|series=SUNY series in Near Eastern Studies|location=|publication-date=2012|page=31|pages=|chapter=Introduction: The Axial Age Breakthrough in Ancient Greece|quote=The emergence of this specific type of Axial Age breakthrough was connected with the special mode of disintegration of the tribal communities and of construction of new collectivities and institutional complexes.

Armstrong argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a "Second Axial Age", including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. It has also been suggested that the [[modern era]] is a new axial age, wherein relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Yves | last = Lambert | title= Religion in Modernity as a New Axial Age: Secularization or New Religious Forms? | journal=Sociology of Religion | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue= | pages= 303|url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98493653 | doi= 10.2307/3711939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be '''chosen people''' by a [[deity]] for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth.{{cite-needed|date=April 2017}} In [[monotheistic]] faiths references to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] are used in constructs such as "God's Chosen People". The phenomenon of a "chosen people" is particularly common in the
Israelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of [[groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|Israelite]] ancestry, as is the case for the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Black Hebrew]] sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the "true Israel". Others claim a "spiritual" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the [[People of God]].

[[Anthropologist]]s commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Haviland|author2=Harald E. L. Prins|author3=Dana Walrath|author4=Bunny McBride|title=The Essence of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmvJ1XtnIQoC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59981-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EitzenZinn2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. Stanley Eitzen|author2=Maxine Baca Zinn|title=In conflict and order: understanding society|year=2003|edition=10th|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-205-37622-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Jews as the chosen people}}
In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the [[Jew]]s, via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Ronald (1968). ''God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy''. In series, ''Religious Book Club'', 182. London: S.C.M. Press&lt;/ref&gt; as the verb ''bahar'' ({{native name|he|בָּחַ֣ר|italics=off}}), and is alluded to elsewhere in the [[Hebrew Bible]] using other terms such as "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nN8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]]. The three largest Jewish denominations—[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.

===Mormonism===
{{See also|Mormonism|Mormonism and Judaism|Mormonism and Islam}}
In [[Mormonism]], all [[Latter Day Saint]]s are viewed as [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]], or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people.
Most practicing Mormons receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes of Israel]]). It is a widely held belief&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/01/of-the-house-of-israel "Of the House of Israel"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-student-study-guide/genesis-44  |title= Genesis 44&amp;nbsp;– Joseph Tests His Brothers |accessdate=|work=[http://www/lds.org/ lds.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}&lt;/ref&gt; that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe of Manasseh]].

that promotes a [[racial]] interpretation of [[Christianity]]. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors{{which?|date=January 2017}} who regarded Europeans as the "chosen people" and Jews as the cursed offspring of [[Cain]]. [[White supremacist]] sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.

==Rastafari==
{{Main article| Rastafari}}
Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation Moses]] in 1985.

==Nation of Islam==

The NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] they were systematically denied knowledge of [[History of Africa|their history]], [[Languages of Africa|language]], [[Culture of Africa|culture]], and [[Traditional African religion|religion]] and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder [[Elijah Muhammad]] called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of [[Allah]] and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

This is most likely a typographical error on the part of the composer or the printer). [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]'s [[coregency]] marked the end of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the reign of [[James II of England]]. The coregency also brought about a shift in the religious [[paradigm]] of 17th-century England, which was [[Roman Catholic]] when James II sat upon the throne. Indeed, the ballad comments on the "vile pop'ry" that ruled the throne prior to the rule of William III, which saw the restoration of [[Protestant]] liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacCubbin |first1=Robert P. |last2=Hamilton-Phillips |first2=Martha |last3=College of William and Mary|last4=Grolier Club|last5=Folger Shakespeare Library|date=1990 |title=The Age of William III &amp; Mary II: Power, Politics and Patronage, 1688-1702 : A Reference Encyclopedia and Exhibition Catalogue |publisher=College of William &amp; Mary |isbn=0962208108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extant copies of the ballad are available at [[Magdelene College]] in the [[Pepys Library]].

==Synopsis==
Set to the tune of "Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EBBA|title=Recording of ''England's Triumph'' sung to the tune of ''Hark the Thundering Cannons Roar''|url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/20887/recording|website=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ballad opens with an [[encomium]] directed toward King William III: "Now the Royal deed is done, / King William’s seated on the Throne, / and we his Subjects justly own, / He was our preservation." The ballad goes on to explicate what it means for England's religious state now that William III is "seated on the throne": "The Glories of our Court are clear, / Now Rome’s dark Clouds all disappear / And shall no more o’re-cast us here, / nor send their priests to fool us. ... [O]ur brave Prince William came, / Who smote the Babylonian Dame, / And brough her Tod-pole Tools to shame, / redeem’d us all from Slav’ry" As the ballad makes clear, the ascension of William and Mary meant that Catholicism, the "[[Whore of Babylon|Babylonian Dame]]" mentioned in these lines, was [[English Reformation|once again no longer the official religion of England]]. The ballad concludes as most encomium ballads do, which is to say with general praise of the subject: "May they all delights obtain, / Prove happy in a prosp’rous Reign, / And e’ery thing they wish for gain, / and prove to them a blessing."

==Form==
The ballad is broken up into eight [[:wikt:octet|octets]] with varying [[rhyme scheme]]s. For instance, the first stanza has an ''AA BB CCC B'' rhyme scheme while the second stanza has an ''AAA B CCC B'' rhyme scheme.

'''Equanimity''' ([[Latin]]: ''æquanimitas'', having an even mind; ''aequus'' even; ''animus'' mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.  The [[virtue]] and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of  major religions and ancient philosophies.
{{wikt}}

==Etymology==
From Fr. ''équanimité'', from L. ''aequanimitatem'' (nom. ''aequanimitas'') "evenness of mind, calmness," from ''aequus'' "even, level" (see equal) + ''animus'' "mind, spirit" (see animus). Meaning "evenness of temper" in English is from 1610s.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व ''[[samatva]]m'' (also rendered ''samatva'' or ''samata'').&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' one reads: ''yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate''. [[Srila Prabhupada]] translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita As it Is'', A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;
                
In his book ''Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity'', [[Swami Sivananda]] states: 

"An aspirant who treads the path to ''samatvam'' must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: ''[[Viveka]]'', discrimination; ''[[vairagya]]'', dispassion; ''shadsampat'', the six virtues (''shama'', mental calmness and control; ''dama'', restraint of the senses; ''[[uparati]]'', sense withdrawal or ''[[pratyahara]]''; ''[[titiksha]]'', endurance; ''shraddha'', faith and ''[[samadhana]]'', mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, ''mumukshutva''. In order to possess the virtue of ''Samatvam'', he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career..."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3, "The Pathway to Samatvam", ''Samatvam: The Yoga of Equanimity'', Swami Sivananda Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Another Sanskrit term for equanimity is ''[[Upeksha (Indian thought)|upekṣhā]]''. This is the term used by [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' (1.33),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Commentary on the Yoga Sutras|author=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|publisher=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-13339.htm#1.33|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''upekṣhā'' is considered to be one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]], along with [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] (''maitri''), [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''karuṇā''), and [[mudita|joy]] (''mudita''). It is related to the idea of [[Vairagya]] or "dispassion". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a [[yoga]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upekshayoga.com/yoga/Principles.html Upeksha yoga]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Yoga]] traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular [[meditation]], combined with regular practice of [[pranayama]], asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.

==Stoicism==
Equanimity is a central concept in [[Stoic ethics]] and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word ''[[apatheia]]'' or ''[[ataraxia]]'' whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word ''aequanimitas''. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father [[Antoninus Pius]]'s last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon "aequanimitas" (equanimity). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Pyrrhonism==
In [[Pyrrhonism]] the term used for equanimity is ''[[ataraxia]]'', which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. 

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], [[upekkha|equanimity]] (''[[upekkhā]]'', ''upekṣhā'') is one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]] and is considered:

{{quote|Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for [[wisdom]] and [[free will|freedom]] and the protector of [[compassion]] and [[love]]. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The [[Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will."|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Equanimity|author=[[Gil Fronsdal]]|publisher=Insight Meditation Center|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/equanimity.html|date=2004-05-29|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Equanimity can also be cultivated through meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahmana|first=Metteyya|date=2016-05-14|title=NEW EQUANIMITY MEDITATION AND TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE TO TEST ITS EFFECTIVENESS|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303111890_NEW_EQUANIMITY_MEDITATION_AND_TOOLS_FROM_PSYCHOLOGY_AND_NEUROSCIENCE_TO_TEST_ITS_EFFECTIVENESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development.  The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv|Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv]].

==Christianity==
[[Samuel Johnson]] defined equanimity as "evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed." In [[Christian philosophy]], equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the [[theological virtues]] of [[gentleness]], [[contentment]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twenty Essays on the Practical Improvement of God's Providential Dispensations as Means of Moral Discipline to the Christian|publisher=RB Seeley and W Burnside|page=51|year=1838|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lFwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Johnson&amp;dq=Equanimity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The word “[[Islam]]” is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''aslama'', which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a [[Muslim]] can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.

==Baha'i Faith==
The voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than "equanimity" in the Baha'i Writings are "detachment" and "selflessness" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: "Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is written about him: "So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: "Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} He wrote: "Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world." {{Citation needed|reason=Source must be directly cited and linked to as footnote|date=June 2018}}

[[File:伏見稲荷５.JPG|thumb|250px|Altar to [[Inari Ōkami]] at the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Shrine]] in [[Kyoto]]. [[Shinto]] is the ethnic religion of the [[Japanese people]].]]

In [[religious studies]], an '''ethnic religion''' (or '''indigenous religion''') is a [[religion]] associated with a particular [[ethnic group]]. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from [[universalizing religion|universal religions]] which claim to not be limited in ethnic or national scope, such as [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-33311-3 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic religions are not only independent religions. Some localised denominations of global religions are practised solely by certain ethnic groups. For example, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] have a unique denominational structure of Christianity known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

== Terminology ==
A number of alternative terms have been used instead of "ethnic" or "indigenous" religions.

The term "primal religion" was coined by [[Andrew Walls]] in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=James L.|last2=Sutcliffe|first2=Steven J.|date=1 March 2006|title=Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001|journal=Religion|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "primal religion," "primitive religion," and "tribal religion" have been contested by Walls' student, Jim Cox, who argues that such terms suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to Christianity. Cox prefers to use the term "indigenous religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Primitive to Indigenous: The Academic Study of Indigenous Religions|last=Cox|first=James L.|publisher=Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-754-65569-5|location=Aldershot|pages=9–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term that is often used is "[[folk religion]]." While "ethnic religion" and "folk religion" have overlapping uses, the latter term implies "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|last=Bowker|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-191-72722-1|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Folk Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "folk religion" can therefore be used to speak of [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] and [[Traditional African religion|African]] indigenous religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as [[Folk Christianity]] or [[Folk Islam]].

== Usage ==
Ethnic religions are distinctive in their relationship with a particular [[ethnic group]] and often in the shaping of one's solidarity with an ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnicity and Religion: Intersections and Comparisons|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1-138-88037-5|editor-last=Ruane|editor-first=Joseph B.|location=London|pages=|editor-last2=Todd|editor-first2=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic religions include [[Hinduism]] of the [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Judaism]] of the [[Jews]], [[Chinese folk religion]] of the [[Han Chinese]], [[Shinto]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] of the [[Serer people|Serer]] of [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann, Diedrich]]; Smith, Edwin William; Forde, Cyril Daryll; [[International African Institute]]; [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]]; [[Project Muse]]; [[JSTOR]] (Organization), ''Africa: journal of the International African Institute, Volume 63'', pp 86-96, 270-1, [[Edinburgh University Press]] for the International African Institute (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diaspora|Diasporic]] groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity, such as [[Hinduism]] among [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|diasporic Indians]] in the [[Caribbean]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Southern Africa|southern]] and [[East Africa|eastern Africa]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Malay Peninsula]],&lt;ref name="van der Veer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3773407 |last=van der Veer |first=Peter |author2=Steven Vertovec |date=April 1991 |title=Brahmanism Abroad: On Caribbean Hinduism as an Ethnic Religion |journal=Ethnology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=149–166|jstor=3773407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the role of [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religion]] and [[Afro-American religions]] among the [[African diaspora in the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2011/10/19/african-religions-gain-following-among-black-christians/|title=Are blacks abandoning Christianity for African faiths?|last=Oduah|first=Chika|date=19 October 2011|website=theGrio|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=all}}

'''Freedom of religion''' is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or [[belief]] in teaching, practice, [[worship]], and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=5 December 2006|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201105738/http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|archivedate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ANDmIIpAmwC&amp;pg=PA29734|title=Congressional Record #29734 – 19 November 2003|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with a [[state religion]], freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not [[religious persecution|persecute]] believers in other faiths.
Freedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.

==History==
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Minerva]] as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]
Historically, ''freedom of religion'' has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while ''freedom of worship'' has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom ''from'' religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of [[dhimmi]]s, literally "protected individuals" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

[[Cyrus the Great]] established the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html Cyrus Cylinder], [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A. Taylor|author2=E. Ray Clendenen|title=Haggai, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC|date=15 October 2004|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8054-0121-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC&amp;pg=PA31 31–32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, [[Zoroastrianism]], Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the [[trial of Socrates]] in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token [[sacrifice]] was similar to refusing to take an [[oath of allegiance]]. This was the core for resentment and the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christian communities]].

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Greek-Jewish clashes at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in 73 AD and 117 AD and in [[Alexandria]] in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

The Romans tolerated most religions, including [[Judaism]] and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate [[Christianity]] until it was legalised by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]] in 311. The [[Edict of Milan]] guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===Muslim world===
Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of [[Medina]] (then known as ''Yathrib''), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] was declared by [[Muhammad]] in the [[Constitution of Medina]]. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept ''[[dhimmi]]'' status and their adult males pay the punitive ''[[jizya]]'' tax instead of the ''[[zakat]]'' paid by Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Njeuma|first=Martin Z.|title=Fulani Hegemony in Yola (Old Adamawa) 1809-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQA4Q6fX7EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=8pyCFSKL0V&amp;dq=Fulani%20Hegemony%20in%20Yola%20(Old%20Adamawa)%201809-1902&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-726-95-0|page=82|quote=Of all the various forms of taxation known to Islamic communities, it seems only two{{snd}} the zakat and the jixya were of importance in Adamawa.

Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French scholar Gustave Le Bon (the author of ''La civilisation des Arabes'') writes "that despite the fact that the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim was free to enjoy equally well with every Muslim all the privileges afforded to the citizens of the state. The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged by a non-Muslim." Mun'im Sirry (2014), ''Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions'', p.179. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0199359363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abou El Fadl|first1=Khaled|authorlink=Khaled Abou El Fadl|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=2007|publisher=[[HarperOne]]|isbn=978-0061189036|page=204|quote = According the dhimma status system, non-Muslims must pay a poll tax in return for Muslim protection and the privilege of living in Muslim territory.

In Islamic history, non-Muslims did occupy high positions, especially in matters that related to fiscal policies or tax collection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious pluralism]] existed in classical [[Islamic ethics]] and [[Sharia]], as the [[religious law]]s and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=C.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order.&lt;ref name="al-Qattan-99"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501|first=Najwa|last=al-Qattan|title=Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=31|issue=3|pages=429–44|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=1999|issn=0020-7438|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

Despite Dhimmis enjoying special statuses under the Caliphates, they were not considered equals, and sporadic persecutions of non-Muslim groups did occur in the history of the Caliphates.&lt;ref&gt;A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility {{ISBN|0-8050-7932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/morocjews.html|title=The Jews of Morocco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Main article|Freedom of religion in India}}
Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Who are the Jews of India? – The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. University of California Press. 2000. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21323-4}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWX6pF2PTJwC&amp;pg=PA26.; "When the Portuguese arrived in 1498, they brought a spirit of intolerance utterly alien to India. They soon established an Office of Inquisition at Goa, and at their hands Indian Jews experienced the only instance of anti-Semitism ever to occur in Indian soil."&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion [[edicts]] have been found written during [[Ashoka the Great]]'s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Although India is an 80% [[Hindu]] country, India is a secular state without any [[state religion]]s.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, [[Hinduism]], has long been a most tolerant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Ludden|title=Contesting the Nation: Religion, Community, and the Politics of Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1585-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC&amp;pg=257 257–58]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajni Kothari]], founder of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] has written, "[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajni Kothari|title=Communalism in Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Rainbow Publishers|isbn=978-81-86962-00-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22foundations+of+a+civilisation+that+is+fundamentally+non–religious%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the [[Mahabharata]], has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. "Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition," the Dalai Lama said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/42229/indias-religious-tolerance-lauded.html|title=India's religious tolerance lauded|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) ([[Ashoka]]). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a [[Edicts of Ashoka|just and humane society]]. Later he promoted the principles of [[Buddhism]], and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:
{{Quote|King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.}} 

On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/christian_persecution_in_india.htm|title=Christian Persecution in India: The Real Story|publisher=Stephen-knapp.com|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |format=PDF |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] counters this argument by saying that [[evangelical]] Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.

In September 2010, the Indian state of [[Kerala]]'s State Election Commissioner announced that "Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers".&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orthodoxherald.com/2010/09/18/%E2%80%98using-places-of-worship-for-campaigning-in-kerala-civic-polls-is-violation-of-poll-code%E2%80%99/|title='Using places of worship for campaigning in Kerala civic polls is violation of poll code'|newspaper=Indian Orthodox Herald|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops.

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====
[[File:CONGRESS COLUMN-BRUSSELS-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (13).jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century allegorical statue on the [[Congress Column]] in Belgium depicting religious freedom]]
Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews]] from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the [[Inquisition]] for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As early as 1380, [[John Wycliffe]] in England denied [[transubstantiation]] and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a [[Papal Bull]] in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemia]]n preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the [[Council of Constance]]. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of [[Granada]], Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the [[Treaty of Granada]], but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The [[Morisco]]s (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]].

[[Martin Luther]] published his famous 95 Theses in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:

* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God's grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of [[indulgence]]s and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the [[Diet of Worms]] before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the [[Wartburg]] in the possessions of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], where he translated the [[New Testament]] into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. [[Huldrych Zwingli]] preached reform in [[Zürich]] from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England]] was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and [[Thomas More]], who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the [[Bern]]ese imposed the reformation on the canton of [[Vaud]] by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in [[Lausanne]] and destroyed all its art and statuary. [[John Calvin]], who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

[[File:ReligiousFreedomStamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A U.S. postage stamp commemorating religious freedom and the [[Flushing Remonstrance]] ]]
The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when [[Mary I of England]] returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England]] was to restore the [[Church of England]] in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The [[King James Bible]] commissioned by King [[James I of England]] and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the [[Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day]] on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the "Michelade" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

====Early steps and attempts in the way of tolerance====

Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and [[Utraquism|Utraquists]]. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the meantime, in Germany [[Philip Melanchthon]] drafted the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France]]. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The [[French Revolution]] then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Early laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom===

====Principality of Transylvania====
In 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's [[Edict of Torda]] declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of [[List of Hungarian monarchs|King of Hungary]], and [[List of Princes of Transylvania|Prince of Transylvania]] [[John Sigismund Zápolya]] (John II.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html|title=History of Transylvania.

However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lightbringers.net/content/story-francis-david-and-king-john-sigismund-establishment-transylvanian-unitarian-church|title=The Story of Francis David and King John Sigismund: The Establishment of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church|work=Lightbringers|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore none of the superintendents or others shall abuse the preachers, no one shall be reviled for his religion by anyone, according to the previous statutes, and it is not permitted that anyone should threaten anyone else by imprisonment or by removal from his post for his teaching.

Four religions ([[Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarianism]]) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxs]], [[Sabbatarians]] and [[Anabaptists]] were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mult-kor.hu/20051125_erdely_es_a_habsburg_vallaspolitika_a_17_szazad_utolso_evtizedeiben "Kovács Kálmán: Erdély és a Habsburg valláspolitika a 17. század utolsó évtizedeiben"] ''Mult-Kor'' (25 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

This religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the [[Szekler Sabbatarians|Sabbatarians]] begun to be persecuted, and forced to convert to one of the accepted religions of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/192.html|title=History of Transylvania.

=====Habsburg rule in Transylvania=====
Also the Unitarians (despite of being one of the "accepted religions") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/290.html|title=History of Transylvania.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Union of Utrecht]] (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciffs, N.J., p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. [[William Penn]], the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Poland====
[[File:Konfederacja Warszawska.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573. The beginning of religious freedom in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
The General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the [[Statute of Kalisz]] was issued by the Duke of [[Greater Poland]] [[Bolesław the Pious|Boleslaus the Pious]] on 8 September 1264 in [[Kalisz]]. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir III of Poland]] in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453 and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinkoff|first=Nancy|title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-KmeZgY2hIC|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-930675-16-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f–KmeZgY2hIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=1539 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{Main article|Warsaw Confederation}}
The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski, Adam. ''The Polish Way''. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in the United States}}
Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] found it necessary to found a new colony in [[Rhode Island]] to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were the most active of the New England persecutors of [[Quakers]], and the persecuting spirit was shared by [[Plymouth Colony]] and the colonies along the [[Connecticut river]].&lt;ref name=PER/&gt; In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]], who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.&lt;ref name=PER&gt;Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

The Act allowed freedom of worship for all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians in Maryland, but [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] anyone who denied the divinity of [[Jesus]]. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J.

Reiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], written in 1779 by [[Thomas Jefferson]], proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those sentiments also found expression in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the national constitution, part of the United States' [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] established the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

===Canada===
{{Further information|Freedom of religion in Canada}}
Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide [[reasonable accommodation]] to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a [[Sikh]] [[turban]], when there is a ''[[bona fide]]'' occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a [[hard hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-60-e.htm#a6 Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere. 2.2.2 Headcoverings].

===International===
On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]]. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/36/a36r055.htm|title=A/RES/36/55.

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states in its Article 14: ''"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{snd}} States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.{{snd}} Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr2int.htm Religious Rights – International Legal Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fb22.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal secular===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued in favour of freedom of religion.|alt=A man posing for a print]]
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] noted in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'', that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country.  That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this [[free competition]] amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 643–49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
Hinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom.&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/beliefs.htm|title=Hindu Beliefs|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. [[Hindus]] believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal. One of the famous Hindu sayings about religion is: "Truth is one; sages call it by different names."&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained at Western Wall for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]
[[Judaism]] includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]]. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as  peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Erica|last2=Galperin|first2=Misha|title=The Case for Jewish Peoplehood: Can We be One?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-401-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC&amp;pg=PA71 71]|quote=The 'hood' is not only a geographic reference; it is a shared identity that may be characterized by joint assumptions, body language, certain expressions, and a host of familial-like behaviors that unite an otherwise dispirate groupe of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not [[ Israeli apartheid| equal ]] with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.

Possibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.

The State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current{{clarify timeframe|date=January 2017}} government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem.  Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having "high" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Global restrictions on Religion (2009" http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], have been arrested at the [[Western Wall]] for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. [[Women of the Wall]] have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-arrest-5-women-at-Western-Wall-for-wearing-tallitot-309436 "Police arrest 5 women at Western Wall for wearing tallitot"] ''Jerusalem Post'' (11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the [[Knesset]] synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: "paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel." MK [[Dov Lipman]] expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view "an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Maltz | first=Judy | title=Non-Orthodox Jews prohibited from praying in Knesset synagogue | date=26 November 2014 | newspaper=Haaretz | url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.628571 | accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.

===Christianity===
[[File:Worship-monument.jpg|left|thumb|Part of the [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar Straus]] Memorial in Washington, D.C. honoring the right to worship]] According to the Catholic Church in the [[Vatican II]] document on religious freedom, ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', "the human person has a right to religious freedom", which is described as "immunity from coercion in civil society".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |title=Declaration on religious freedom – ''Dignitatis humanae'' |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211202206/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of religious freedom "leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition, this right "is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Prior to this, [[Pope Pius IX]] had written a document called the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]. ''The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: "[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true" (15); "[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship"; "[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=The Syllabus|author=[[Pope Pius IX]]|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}, [http://www.ewtn.com/ Global Catholic Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|main line]] churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also affirms religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may"'', [http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng the eleventh Article of Faith].&lt;/ref&gt;

However others, such as African scholar [[Makau Mutua]], have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, "Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions."&lt;ref&gt;Mutua, Makau. 2004.

In their book ''[[Breaking India]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] and [[Aravindan Neelakandan]] discussed the "US Church" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to "save" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise{{snd}} a "network" of organizations, individuals, and churches{{snd}} that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingindia.com/introduction/|title=Introduction|work=Breaking India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel Spring]] has written about the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the ''Imperium romanum''. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be "civilized" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, "just as the ''civitas''; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human{{snd}} to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature{{snd}} one had now also to be Christian." After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis|author=Joel H.

[[Conversion to Islam]] is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert  from Islam to another religion. Certain [[Muslim-majority countries]] are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries{{who|date=February 2012}} having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United States |first=Department of State|title=2010 International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/index.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012|reason=this may be supportable, but I don't see clear support in the source cited}} 

Islamic theologians{{Who|date=October 2009}} quote the [[Qur'an]] ({{Cite quran|2|256|expand=no|q=There is no compulsion in religion}} and {{Cite quran|109|1|end=6|expand=no|q=Say: O you who reject faith, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship...To you be your religion, and to me be mine}}, i.e., Sura [[Al-Kafirun]]) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.

{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, "Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good." In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; "The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.{{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims.

===Changing religion===
{{Main article|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls "proselytizing universalist faiths" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|format=PDF|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy in Islam====
{{Main article|Apostasy in Islam|Takfir|Mutaween}}
[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Legal opinion on apostasy by the [[Fatwa]] committee at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], the highest Islamic institution in the world, concerning the case of a man who converted to Christianity: "Since he left Islam, he will be invited to express his regret. If he does not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law."]]
In Islam, apostasy is called "''ridda''" ("turning back") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a "''murtad fitri''" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a "''murtad milli''" (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }} from "Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out" by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd" /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A. Rahman|title=Punishment of Apostasy in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC|year=2007|publisher=The Other Press|isbn=978-983-9541-49-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=PA132 132–42]|chapter=Summary and Conclusions|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=Pa132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: "Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not."&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266.

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/abington-school-district-v-schempp|title=Abington School District V Schempp - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's rights==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2017}}
The law in Germany provides the term of "religious majority" (''Religiöse Mündigkeit'') with a minimum age for [[Minor (law)|minors]] to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/kerzg/BJNR009390921.html|title=Gesetz über die religiöse Kindererziehung|publisher=Bundesrecht.juris.de|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar laws in Austria&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familienrecht.at/fileadmin/gesetze/abgb/rekerz.pdf Bundesgesetz 1985 über die religiöse Kindererziehung] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze.ch/sr/210/210_025.htm|title=Schweizerisches Zivilgesetzbuch Art 303: Religiöse Erziehung|publisher=Gesetze.ch|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Religious Freedom Day==
27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]], a group of [[Quakers]] executed by the [[Puritans]] on [[Boston Common]] for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] between 1659–1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margery Post Abbott|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7088-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-9.html Religious Freedom Day, 2006 – A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/library/hot_releases/January_16_2001_6.html Religious Freedom Day, 2001 – Proclamation by the President of the United States of America 15 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concerns==
In its 2011 annual report, the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]]'' designated fourteen nations as "countries of particular concern". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were [[Rohingya people|Burma]], China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="prc-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2" /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the "very high" category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold G. Koenig''' is a [[psychiatrist]] on the faculty of [[Duke University]].  His ideas have been covered in ''[[Newsweek]]'' and other news media with regard to [[Religion and health|religion, spirituality and health]], a focus of some of his research and clinical practice. [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]] has provided great financial support to his activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/blindfaithunholy00sloa|title=Blind faith : the unholy alliance of religion and medicine|last=Sloan|first=Richard P.|date=2006|publisher=New York : St. Martin's Press|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60-63|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic career==
Koenig graduated with a B.S. in [[history]] from [[Stanford University]] (1974), later receiving his MD (1982) from [[University of California, San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="cvkoenig"&gt;[http://spiritualityandhealth.duke.edu/images/pdfs/Koenig_Full_CV.pdf Curriculum Vitae: Harold G. Koenig], accessed 1 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Clinical Assistant Professor in Psychiatry (1992) and has been Professor of Psychiatry (2004-) at [[Duke University]] Medical Center.

He is currently director of Duke's Center for the Study of Religion/Spirituality and Health.

==Research==
Koenig has published over 280 scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals, scholarly professional journal articles and 60 chapters in professional books.&lt;ref name=cvkoenig/&gt; In a cooperation with [[Raphael M. Bonelli]] from [[Sigmund Freud University Vienna]] he undertook the first systematic [[evidence based]] analysis on the connection between [[mental disorder]]s and [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonelli | first1 = RM | last2 = Koenig | first2 = H | year = 2013 | title = Mental Disorders, Religion and Spirituality 1990 to 2010: A Systematic Evidence-Based Review | url = | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 52| issue = 2| pages = 657–73| pmid = 23420279 | doi=10.1007/s10943-013-9691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers conclude that there is good [[evidence]] that religious involvement is correlated with better mental health in the areas of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and [[suicide]]; some evidence in [[Stress-related disorders]] and [[dementia]]; insufficient evidence in [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]], and no data in many other mental disorders.

==Media coverage==
Koenig's ideas have been covered in a wide variety of news media, ranging from BBC radio to the Vatican Radio.&lt;ref name=cvkoenig/&gt; Examples include:

* In 2009, ''Newsweek'' featured comments from Koenig, stating that he was "leading the charge for a better understanding of patients' religious and spiritual beliefs in the medical setting. 'It just makes too much sense,' he says, when patient after patient tells him, 'Doctor, religion is the most important thing; it keeps me going.' Koenig advocates that doctors take spiritual histories of any patient they are likely to have an ongoing relationship with, asking questions like: 'Is religion a source of comfort or stress? Do you have any religious beliefs that would influence decision-making? Do you have any spiritual needs that someone should address?'"&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Kalb (2003, Nov. 10). "[http://www.newsweek.com/faith-healing-133365 Can Religion Improve Health? While The Debate Rages In Journals And Med Schools, More Americans Ask For Doctors' Prayers ]." ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===Books===
Koenig has authored or edited more than 35 books&lt;ref name=cvkoenig/&gt; that include:

This page charts a '''list of countries by importance of religion.

== Methodology ==
The table below is based upon global [[Gallup Poll]] in 2009 research which asked "Is religion important in your daily life?". Percentages for "yes" and "no" answers are listed below; they often do not add up to 100% because some answered "don't know" or did not answer.&lt;ref name=gallup-religiosity-poor-nations&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=27 May 2015}} (in which numbers have been rounded)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International League of Religious Socialists''' is an umbrella organization of [[religious socialism|religious socialist]] movements in political parties throughout the world. Founded in the 1920s, it has member groups in 21 countries totalling 200,000 members. For most of its history it was mainly European and contained mainly [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] groups, but has recently expanded to the Americas, Africa, and Australia and to include more groups with connections to other religions. It is an associate organisation of the [[Socialist International]].

'''Jewish identity''' is the objective or subjective state of [[Identity (social science)|perceiving oneself]] as a Jew and as relating to being [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=87sx1v9UmlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jewish+identity&amp;sig=uWlgMwXei1dyZFhqvXV3RxvWK3I ''Spinoza, Liberalism, and the Question of Jewish Identity'']. [[Yale University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a broader definition, Jewish identity does not depend on whether a person is regarded as a Jew by others, or by an external set of religious, or legal, or sociological norms. Jewish identity does not need to imply religious orthodoxy.  Accordingly, Jewish identity can be [[Cultural Judaism|cultural]] in nature. Jewish identity can involve ties to the Jewish community.  Orthodox Judaism bases Jewishness on matrilineal descent. According to Jewish law ([[halacha]]), all those born of a Jewish mother are considered Jewish, regardless of personal beliefs or level of observance of Jewish law.

[[Atheist Jew|Jews who are atheists]] may have a Jewish identity. While the absolute majority of people with this identity are of Jewish ethnicity, people of a [[Who is a Jew?#"Half-Jewish"|mixed Jewish and non-Jewish background]] or [[gentiles]] of [[Zera Yisrael|Jewish ancestry]] may still have a sense of Jewish self-identity.

==Categories==
Jewish identity can be described as consisting of three interconnected parts:

#'''[[Jewish peoplehood]]''', an ethnic identity composed of [[Jewish ethnic divisions|several subdivisions]] that [[ethnogenesis|evolved]] in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]].
#'''[[Judaism|Jewish religion]]''', observance of spiritual and ritual tenets of Judaism.
#'''[[Jewish culture]]''', celebration of traditions, [[secular Jew|secular]] and religious alike.

==A cultural/ancestral concept==
Jewish identity can be [[cultural]], religious, and/or through ancestry. There are religious, cultural, and ancestral components to Jewish identity due to its fundamental non-proselytizing nature, as opposed to Christian or Muslim identity which are both "universal" religions in that they ascribe to the notion that their faith is meant to be [[missionary|spread]] throughout all of humanity, regardless of nationality, (and still are, though to a far lesser extent than throughout its history in the case of Christianity).&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 6:11, Romans 16:22, Colossians 4:18, 2 Thessalonians 3:17&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jewish identity is firmly intertwined with Jewish ancestry dating back to the historical [[Kingdom of Israel (United Monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], which was largely depopulated by the Roman Empire c. first century CE, leading to what is known as today as the [[Jewish Diaspora]].

==In contemporary sociology==
{{see also|Sociology of Jewry}}
Jewish identity began to gain the attention of Jewish sociologists in the United States with the publication of [[Marshall Sklare]]'s "Lakeville studies".&lt;ref&gt;Sklare, Marshall, Joseph Greenblum, and Benjamin Bernard Ringer. The Lakeville Studies. Under the Dir. of Marshall Sklare. Basic books, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other topics explored in the studies was Sklare's notion of a "good Jew".&lt;ref&gt;Sklare, Marshall. "The Image of the Good Jew in Lakeville." Observing America’s Jews. Brandeis University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The "good Jew" was essentially an idealized form of Jewish identity as expressed by the Lakeville respondents. Today, sociological measurements of Jewish identity have become the concern of the Jewish Federations who have sponsored numerous community studies across the U.S.;&lt;ref&gt;Sheskin, Ira M. "Comparisons between local Jewish community studies and the 2000–01 National Jewish Population Survey." ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]'' 25, no. 1 (2005): 158-192.&lt;/ref&gt; policy decisions (in areas such as funding, programming, etc.) have been shaped in part due to studies on Jewish identity.

==Antisemitism and Jewish identity==
According to the social-psychologist Simon Herman, antisemitism plays a part in shaping Jewish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Simon N. Jewish identity: A social psychological perspective. Transaction Pub, (1989): 51.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is echoed by religious leaders such as [[Rabbi]] [[Jonathan Sacks]] who writes that modern Jewish communities and the modern Jewish identity are deeply influenced by [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/09/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity-12 Love, Hate, and Jewish Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414202138/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/09/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity-12 |date=14 April 2012 }}, by Jonathan Sacks.

'''''Libertas ecclesiae''''' ("freedom of the Church" in [[Latin]]) is the notion of freedom of ecclesiastical authority from secular or the temporal power, which guided the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform]] movement which began in the 11th century.

==Description==
After the decentralization of the post-Carolingian period, this became the slogan of the Church in light of disapproval over lay warlords installing themselves as abbots and other high-profile churchmen. Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.

What resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.

In addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.

[[File:RELIGIONES.png|thumb|Religious symbols in clock-wise order from top: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Bahá'í Faith]],  [[Hinduism]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]],  [[Slavic neopaganism]], [[Celtic polytheism]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Heathenism (Germanic paganism)]], [[Semitic neopaganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Kemetism]] (Egyptian paganism), [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism (Greek paganism)]], [[Italo-Roman neopaganism]].]]
While [[religion]] is hard to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who defined it as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."&lt;ref&gt;(Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;}} A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category."&lt;ref&gt;(Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[sacred history|sacred histories]] that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the universe. They tend to derive [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s, or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]]. According to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com|title=World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''religion'' is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[faith]]" or "belief system", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized [[religious behaviour|behaviours]], including [[clergy|clerical hierarchies]], a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, [[local church|congregations]] of [[laity]], regular meetings or services for the purposes of [[veneration]] of a [[deity]] or for [[prayer]], [[shrine|holy places]] (either natural or architectural) or [[religious text]]s. Certain religions also have a [[sacred language]] often used in [[liturgy|liturgical]] services. The practice of a religion may also include [[sermon]]s, commemoration of the activities of a [[god]] or gods, [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]], [[ritual]]s, [[rite]]s, [[ceremonies]], [[worship]], [[initiation]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[marriage]]s, [[meditation]], [[invocation]], [[mediumship]], [[religious music|music]], [[religious art|art]], [[sacred dance|dance]], [[Community service|public service]] or other aspects of human culture. Religious beliefs have also been used to explain [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] [[phenomena]] such as [[out-of-body experience]]s, [[near-death experience]]s and [[reincarnation]], along with many other [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parapsych.org/base/about.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iands.org/about-ndes/key-nde-facts.html|title=Key Facts about Near-Death Experiences|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics [[Religious studies|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories: [[major religious groups|world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], international faiths; [[Ethnic religion|indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and [[new religious movement]]s, which refers to recently developed faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. Page 06.&lt;/ref&gt; One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and thus religion, as a concept, has been [[Reification (fallacy)|applied inappropriately]] to non-Western cultures that are not based upon such systems, or in which these systems are a substantially simpler construct.{{further information|Prehistoric religion|History of religion}}

; [[wikt:Bible thumper|Bible thumper]] (also "[[wikt:Bible basher|Bible basher]]"; mainly US): Someone perceived as aggressively imposing their [[Christian beliefs]] upon others. The term derives from preachers thumping their hands down on the [[Bible]], or thumping the Bible itself, to emphasize a point during a [[sermon]]. The term's target domain is broad and can often extend to anyone engaged in a public show of religion, fundamentalist or not. The term is most commonly used in English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Robert E.|title=Ronald Reagan's Presidency: The Impact of an Alcoholic Parent|journal=Political Psychology|date=1 October 2008 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=737–765 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00662.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=Yet a danger does still remain. It is the danger of "cafeteria Christianity," which lets people mix and match traditions any way they want, without discipline and without accountability. Unless we transcend cafeteria Christianity, our practices will be more [[sarabaite]] or [[Gyrovagues#Legacy|gyrovague]] than [[Benedictine]].}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news

| title =  Archbishop calls on Costa Ricans to abandon "cafeteria Christianity" and defend life
| location = San Jose | date = 29 March 2005 |quote= Archbishop Hugo Barrantes Urena of San Jose, Costa Rica, told Costa Ricans in his Easter message to embrace the faith without conditions or short-cuts and to defend the life of the unborn against efforts to legalize abortion. The archbishop warned that “based on a relativistic understanding of the Christian faith and a conditional adherence to the Church, some Catholics seek to construct a Christianity and, consequently, a Church to their own liking, unilateral and outside the identity and mission that Jesus Christ has fundamentally given us.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Fundie]]: (US) Shortening of [[fundamentalist]]. Usually used to mean a Christian fundamentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n35_7HAYRWEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Language of Defamation Cases | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=[[Roger Shuy|Shuy, Roger W.]] | year=2009 | pages=81| isbn=9780199742318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestants===
; Bible basher: (UK, Australia, New Zealand) a Protestant, particularly one from a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] denomination, who believes in the fundamentalist authority of the Bible; also commonly used universally against Christians who are perceived to go out of their way to force their faith upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203962114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UIjVGcSe8MC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22bible+thumper%22+etymology#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bible%20thumper%22%20etymology&amp;f=false|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Holy Roller]]: (US) an enthusiastic Protestant prone to rolling on the floor, suffering from fits or "speaking in tongues" ([[Pentecostal]]s during worship or prayer). The term ''holy roller'', however, is applied to some Evangelical Protestants, especially charismatics, if they are vocal about their own religious views or critical of individuals who do not meet their moral standards. Similar to Bible thumper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50208190?query_type=word&amp;queryword=roller "roller, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;", definition 17b,]{{dead link|date=July 2016}} ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' (account required for online access).

'''Liturgics''' is the [[academic discipline]] dedicated to the study of [[liturgy]] (public worship rites, rituals, and practices). Liturgics scholars typically specialize in a single approach drawn from another scholarly field.  The most common sub-disciplines are: [[history]] or [[church history]], [[theology]], and [[anthropology]]. Although liturgics scholars using these approaches apply the principles of their respective disciplines to their research, all liturgics scholars focus their work in the [[ritual]] behaviors of the members of faith communities.

'''The Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden''' was a [[mass murder]] crime committed by unknown gunmen inside a home for older people in [[Aden]], [[Yemen]] on 4 March 2016.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/world/middleeast/gunmen-kill-14-at-nursing-home-in-yemen-started-by-mother-teresa.html|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Nursing Home in Yemen Started by Mother Teresa|date=5 March 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

16 people were killed including four [[Catholicism|Catholic]] nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/here-are-the-faces-of-the-nuns-who-were-martyred-in-yemen-84893|title=Here are the faces of the nuns who were martyred in Yemen|work=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian priest, Tom Ozhonaniel, was kidnapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/yemen-gunmen-kidnap-indian-priest-care-home-where-16-including-4-nuns-were-slaughtered-1547876|title=Yemen: Gunmen kidnap Indian priest from care home where 16 including 4 nuns were slaughtered|author=William Watkinson|work=International Business Times UK|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The identities of the attackers are unknown. Media outlets published a statement attributed to [[Ansar al-Sharia]], one of the active [[jihadist]] organizations in the country, denies any relation to the incident.&lt;ref name="qaeda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/06/middleeast/yemen-attack-qaeda-denies-link|title=Al Qaeda denies link to attack that killed nuns in Yemen|author=Faith Karimi, CNN|date=6 March 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/missing-indian-priest-in-yemen-abducted-by-terrorists-sushma-swaraj/story-hYxUiPYtLFdlfswm7qvdZM.html|title=Missing Indian priest in Yemen abducted by 'terrorists': Sushma Swaraj|work=Hindustantimes|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times of India]]'' posited the attackers belonged to the Yemen-based affiliate of the Islamic State (ISIS) group.&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/middle-east-news/Senior-Indian-nun-of-Yemen-aid-home-to-be-evacuated/articleshow/51297336.cms|title=Senior Indian nun of Yemen aid home to be evacuated|date=7 March 2016|work=The Times of India|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Christianity in Yemen}}
Christian presence in [[Yemen]] goes back to the fourth century AD to hold a number of [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] believers due to the efforts of [[Theophilos the Indian]]. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but estimated at between 3,000 and 25,000 people,&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108496.htm|title=Yemen|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of them are refugees or temporary residents.

[[Freedom of worship]], conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized in the Constitution or as laws or legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193127.pdf|format=PDF|title=Yemen : Executive summary|website=State.gov|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Wahhabism|Wahabbi]] activities linked to [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Al-Islah]] were being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelagh Weir|title=A Tribal Order: Politics and Law in the Mountains of Yemen|date=2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292773974|quote=''These activities were encouraged and financed, as elsewhere in Yemen, by the then Wahhabi-controlled Ministry of Religious Guidance (irsha ̄d), by Saudi and Yemeni business figures and by the Yemeni Reform Grouping islah''|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; which says that its tasks "to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemen-nic.info/ministations/section.php?SECTION_ID=452|title=وزارة الأوقاف والإرشاد|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missionaries of Charity, founded by [[Mother Teresa]], have worked in Aden since 1992, and the order has three other centers in [[Sana'a]], [[Taiz]] and [[Al Hudaydah|Hodeidah]]. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two from India and the third from the Philippines, at the hands of a member of Al-Islah Abdullah al-Nashiri, arguing that they were calling for conversion to [[Christianity]]. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205561/too-deep-evan-kohlmann|title=National Review Online|author=Evan Kohlmann|date=17 January 2003|work=National Review Online|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors say that the hospital was "a political football" often raised by Islamists (Al-Islah), who talked about it in mosques and hospital workers describing Hospital workers as "spies".

In December 2015, a Catholic church in Aden was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gunmen-kill-16-at-retirement-home-in-aden-1457094756|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Yemeni Home for the Elderly|author=Saleh al-Batati in Yemen and Asa Fitch in Dubai|date=6 March 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from [[John Bosco]] remained, and twenty workers of charitable missions in the country, described by [[Pope Francis]] by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict.

==Attack==
The attack on the house took place at 12:00pm local time, when two armed men had persuaded the guards to let them through the main gate having claimed they were going to visit their elderly mother. Once they entered, they began to shoot randomly, according to Indian officials at the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/4-indian-nurses-among-16-dead-in-yemen-gun-attack-govt-verifying-reports|title=Indian nun among 16 killed by gunmen in Yemen; victims handcuffed, shot in the head|date=5 March 2016|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the building, nuns were preparing breakfast. Four of the five nuns sensed danger and tried to hide in a convent, where they were shot dead in an open area. All the rooms were stormed and the meeting tent was destroyed, as were statues and crucifixes in the small church. In one picture, two nuns are shown lying on the ground in a dirt yard, after having been shot [[Capital punishment|execution-style]]. The attackers were dressed in a "semi-blue" uniform.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; According to the [[Catholic News Agency]], the last prayer said by the nuns before they were killed says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/theres-no-question-the-missionaries-of-charity-died-as-martyrs-52544/|title=There's no question – the Missionaries of Charity in Yemen 'died as martyrs'|work=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Lord, teach me to be [[Generosity|generous]]. Teach me to serve you as you deserve; to give and not to count the cost, to fight and not to heed the wounds, to toil and not to seek for rest, to labor and not to ask for reward.}}

Sunita Kumar, a spokesman for the charity's mission, described the killers as "demented", adding "there is no other explanation as to why armed people would enter the premises of the home and shoot down innocent, harmless nurses who had dedicated their lives to serving others."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; Bishop Michael Lewis of the Anglican Church said the compound contained seventy or eighty elderly people, many destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/03/prayers-offered-after-killing-of-nuns-in-yemen.aspx|title=Prayers offered after killing of nuns in Yemen|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Parolin]] commented that [[Pope Francis]] prayed that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.&lt;ref name="qaeda"/&gt;

Pope Francis described the crime as "satanic", stating that the nuns were "martyrs of today", adding that they were killed by both the attackers, and a "globalization of indifference.". His statement was published, including the following quote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/pope-says-four-nuns-were-killed-yemen-their-attackers-and-globalization|title=Pope Francis says nuns killed in Yemen attack are victims of ‘the globalization of indifference’|work=America Magazine|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|In the name of God, he calls upon all parties in the present conflict to renounce violence, and to renew their commitment to the people of Yemen, particularly those most in need, whom the Sisters and their helpers sought to serve.}}

The Missionaries of Charity announced it would continue its work in Yemen despite the violence and danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=27700|title=Missionaries of Charity pledge to continue work in Yemen|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

==Context==
In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30–33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197–198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509–510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504–505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16–17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87–88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306–307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610–611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12022">The '''phenomenology of religion''' concerns the [[Experience|experiential]] aspect of [[religion]], describing religious phenomena in terms consistent with the orientation of worshippers. It views religion as made up of different components, and studies these components across religious traditions in order to gain some understanding of them.

== Chantepie de la Saussaye ==
The first explicit use of the phrase "phenomenology of religion" occurs in the ''Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte'' (Handbook of the History of Religions), written by Pierre Daniël Chantepie de la Saussaye in 1887, wherein he articulates the task of the science of religion and gives an "Outline of the phenomenology of religion".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 694; cf. James: 42-45)&lt;/ref&gt; Employing the terminology of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], Chantepie divides his science of religion into two areas of investigation, essence and manifestations, which are approached through investigations in philosophy and history, respectively.  However, Chantepie’s phenomenology "belongs neither to the history nor the philosophy of religion as Hegel envisioned them".&lt;ref&gt;45&lt;/ref&gt; For Chantepie, it is the task of phenomenology to prepare historical data for philosophical analysis through "a collection, a grouping, an arrangement, and a classifying of the principal groups of religious conceptions".&lt;ref&gt;43&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of phenomenology as a grouping of manifestations is similar to the conception of phenomenology articulated by Robison and the British; however, insofar as Chantepie conceives of phenomenology as a preparation for the philosophical elucidation of essences, his phenomenology is not completely opposed to that of Hegel.

== Kristensen ==
Chantepie’s ''Lehrbuch'' was highly influential, and many researchers began similar efforts after its publication and its subsequent translation into English and French.&lt;ref&gt;141&lt;/ref&gt; One such researcher was [[William Brede Kristensen]].  In 1901, Kristensen was appointed the first professorship relating to the phenomenology of religion at the University of Leiden.&lt;ref&gt;[[ibid]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the material from Kristensen’s lectures on the phenomenology of religion was edited posthumously, and the English translation was published in 1960 as ''The Meaning of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: xiii&lt;/ref&gt; James notes that Kristensen’s phenomenology "adopts many of the features of Chantepie’s grouping of religious phenomena," and penetrates further into the intricacies of Chantepie’s phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;James: 141-43&lt;/ref&gt;
  
For Chantepie, phenomenology is affected by the philosophy and [[history of religion]], but for Kristensen, it is also the medium whereby the philosophy and history of religion interact with and affect one another.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 9&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Kristensen’s account of the relationship between historical manifestations and philosophy is more similar to that of Hegel than it is to Chantepie.  In defining the religious essence of which he explores historical manifestations, Kristensen appropriates [[Rudolf Otto]]’s conception of ''das Heilige'' ("the holy" or "the sacred").  Otto describes ''das Heilige'' with the expression ''mysterium tremendum et fascinans''—a numinous power revealed in a moment of "awe" that admits of both the horrible shuddering of "religious dread" (''tremendum'') and fascinating wonder (''fascinans'') with the overpowering majesty (''majestas'') of the ineffable, "wholly other" mystery (''mysterium'').&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 15-18; Otto: 5-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Chantepie, Kristensen argues that phenomenology seeks the “meaning” of religious phenomena.  Kristensen clarifies this supposition by defining the meaning that his phenomenology is seeking as “the meaning that the religious phenomena have for the believers themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;James: 144&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kristensen argues that phenomenology is not complete in grouping or classifying the phenomena according to their meaning, but in the act of understanding.  “Phenomenology has as its objects to come as far as possible into contact with and to understand the extremely varied and divergent religious data”.&lt;ref&gt;Kristensen: 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a phenomenologist, Kristensen was less interested in philosophical presuppositions than in his concrete depth-research in the incidental religious phenomena. These subjects concerned mythological material (such as Creation, the Flood etc.) as well as human action (such as baptism, Olympic Games etc.), and objects of nature and handicrafts.
In all of this he only made use of the authentic sources: writings and images by the believers themselves. This procedure compelled him to reduce the field of his research - he had to profoundly master all relating languages and writings in order to be able to understand his sources in a way as they would have wanted to be understood themselves.
Consequently, he reduced his field of research to the phenomena in religions living around the origin of Christianity: during the millennia before and the centuries after Christ, in Iran (Avesta), Babylonia and Assyria, Israel, Egypt, Greece and Rome.
The required knowledge of speeches, also, is one of the causes that only few (Van der Leeuw, Bleeker) of his pupils did carry on in his line, although many scholars showed interests in the results of his research.
Apart from his synopsis ''The Meaning of Religion'', and a just simple ''Introduction in History of Religion'', his publications are mostly restricted to the results of his incidental partial researches, published in the shape of a Communication of the Royal Academy of the Netherlands.

== van der Leeuw ==
The phenomenological approach to religion developed in [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]]’s ''Phänomenologie der Religion'' (1933) follows Kristensen in many respects, while also appropriating the phenomenology of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the [[hermeneutics]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].

For van der Leeuw, understanding is the subjective aspect of phenomena, which is inherently intertwined with the objectivity of that which is manifest.  Van der Leeuw articulates the relation of understanding to understood phenomena according to the schema outlined in Dilthey’s definition of the human sciences (''Geisteswissenschaften'') as sciences that are “based on the relations between experience, expression and understanding” (“''Verhältnis von Erlebnis, Ausdruck, und Verstehen''”).&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1956: 776; 1963a: 676&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw correlates subjective experience, expression, and understanding with three objective levels of appearing—relative concealment (''Verborgenheit''), relative transparency (''Durchsichtigkeit''), and gradually becoming manifest or revealed (''Offenbarwerden''), wherein the understanding of what is becoming revealed is the primordial level of appearing from which the experienced concealment and expressed transparency of appearing are derived.&lt;ref&gt;1956: 769; 1963a: 671&lt;/ref&gt;

Because van der Leeuw, like Kristensen, appropriates Otto’s concept of ''das Heilige'' in defining the essential category of religion, the transcendence becoming revealed in all human understanding can be further described as sacred — an overpowering “wholly other,” which becomes revealed in astonishing moments of dreadful [[awe]] (''Scheu'') and wonderful fascination.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 23, 681; Otto: 14-32&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Leeuw argues that this concept of religious dread is also present in Kierkegaard’s work on ''[[Angst]]'' and in Heidegger’s statement that “what arouses dread is ‘being in the world’ itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 463; cf. Kierkegaard; Heidegger 1962; 230&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, van der Leeuw recognizes that, although dreadful, Being-in-the-world is fundamentally characterized as [[wikt:cura|care]] (''Sorge''), the existential structure whereby ''[[Dasein]]'' is concerned with meaningful relationships in the world alongside other beings.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 339, 543; cf. Heidegger 1962: 364-70&lt;/ref&gt;

Because all experiences disclose concealed (wholly other) transcendence to the understanding, all experiences of Being-in-the-world are ultimately religious experiences of the sacred, whether explicitly recognized as such or not.  Human being as such is ''[[homo religiosus]]'', the opposite of ''homo negligens''.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Leeuw 1963: 50, 680&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the task of the phenomenology of religion to interpret the various ways in which the sacred appears to human beings in the world, the ways in which humans understand and care for that which is revealed to them, for that which is ultimately wholly other mystery.
Among other great phenomenologists who worked and influenced phenomenology of religion are [[Henry Corbin]],  [[Ninian Smart]], [[Mircea Eliade]].

&lt;/ref&gt; Within the academic debate, political ideologies that resemble religion are sometimes referred to as [[political religion]]s.

While the more serious-minded participants in these groups may prefer to consider themselves part of a proper religion, or not part of a religion at all, the mainstream ascribes to them a fringe status. Such groups as the [[Church of Scientology]], the [[Raëlian Church]] and [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]], seen as dangerous, exploitative, secretive, or closed, have been classified as pseudoreligious [[cult]]s.

Others may begin as splinters or hold-overs from traditional religions based in [[Apocryphal]] or [[Pseudepigraphical]] writings not accepted within the originating religion.

Examples of marginal movements with founding figures, liturgies and recently invented traditions that have been studied as legitimate social practices include various [[New Age]] movements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:CILVII,45=RIB152Bath.jpg|thumb|Dedication from [[Roman Britain]] announcing that a local official has restored a ''locus religiosus''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' VII.45 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 4920.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''religiō'', origin of the modern [[lexeme]] ''[[religion]]'' (via [[Old French]]/[[Middle Latin]]&lt;ref&gt;The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:75.&lt;/ref&gt;) is of ultimately obscure etymology. It is recorded beginning in the 1st century BC, i.e. in [[Classical Latin]] at the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]], notably by [[Cicero]], in the sense of "scrupulous or strict observance of the [[mos maiorum|traditional ''cultus'']]".

==Etymology==
The classical explanation of the word,  traced to [[Cicero]] himself, derives it from  ''re-'' (again) + ''lego'' in the sense of "choose", "go over again" or "consider carefully".
Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligo}}'' "bind, connect", probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re-'' (again) + ''ligare'' or "to reconnect," which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation of [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.'' Toronto. Thomas Allen, 2004. {{ISBN|0-88762-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Power of Myth]],'' with Bill Moyers, ed. Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem with these etymologies, regardless of whether one favours  ''lego'' or ''ligo'', is that the now-familiar prefix [[:wikt:re-|re-]] "again" is not attested prior to its occurrence in ''religio'' and is itself in need of an etymological explanation.

==Significance in Roman religion==
Within the system of what we would now call "[[ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]] (in the modern sense of the word), the term ''religio''   originally meant an obligation to the gods, something expected by them from human beings or a matter of particular care or concern as related to the gods,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Linderski]], "The Augural Law", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16 (1986), p. 2180, and in the same volume, G.J. Szemler, "Priesthoods and Priestly Careers in Ancient Rome," p. 2322.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p.33, 1889. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']; [[Max Müller]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA28&amp;id=aM0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=4 Introduction to the science of religion]''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, ''religio'' might be translated better as "religious scruple" than with the English word "religion".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition of ''religio'' offered by [[Cicero]] is ''cultus deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' 2.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Religio'' among the Romans was not based on "[[faith]]", but on knowledge, including and especially [[orthopraxy|correct practice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ando, ''The Matter of the Gods'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religio'' (plural ''religiones'') was the [[pietas|pious practice]] of Rome's traditional cults, and was a cornerstone of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p. 279: "Care for the gods, the very meaning of religio, had [therefore] to go through life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was "necessary". Religious behavior – ''pietas'' in Latin, ''eusebeia'' in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats."&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional social norms that regulated public, private, and military life. To the Romans, their success was self-evidently due to their practice of proper, respectful ''religio'', which gave the gods what was owed them and which was rewarded with social harmony, peace and prosperity.

Religious law maintained the proprieties of divine honours, sacrifice, and ritual. Impure sacrifice and incorrect ritual were ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitia]]'' (faults, hence "vice," the English derivative); excessive devotion, fearful grovelling to deities, and the improper use or seeking of divine knowledge were ''[[superstitio]]''; neglecting the ''religiones'' owed to the traditional gods was [[atheism]], a charge leveled during the Empire at Jews,&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Lightstone, "Roman Diaspora Judaism," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 360, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians, and Epicureans.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide D. Simpson, "Epicureans, Christians, Atheists in the Second Century," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 72 (1941) 372–381.&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these moral deviations could cause divine anger (''ira deorum'') and, therefore, harm the State.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard ''et al''., ''Literacy in the Roman world'', Ann Arbor, Mich.: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 1991, Vol. 1, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Religion in ancient Rome]].

''Religiosus'' was something pertaining to the gods or marked out by them as theirs, as distinct from ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'', which was something or someone given to them by humans. Hence, a graveyard was not primarily defined as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|sacer]]'' but a ''locus religiosus'', because those who lay within its boundaries were considered belonging to the [[di Manes]].&lt;ref&gt;F. De Visscher "Locus religiosus" ''Atti del Congresso internazionale di Diritto Romano'', 3, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Places struck by lightning were [[taboo]]&lt;ref&gt;Warde Fowler considers a possible origin for ''sacer'' in taboos applied to holy or accursed things or places, without direct reference to deities and their property. W. Warde Fowler "The Original Meaning of the Word Sacer" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', I, 1911, p.57-63&lt;/ref&gt; because they had been marked as ''religiosus'' by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- the Varro's presumably a fragment - no idea which one, so this needs checking --&gt;Varro. LL V, 150. See also Festus, 253 L: "A place was once considered to become ''religiosus'' which looked to have been dedicated to himself by a god": "''locus statim fieri putabatur religiosus, quod eum deus dicasse videbatur"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1885">The '''Religious Experience Research Centre''' was founded by the distinguished marine biologist Professor [[Alister Hardy]] FRS in 1969 as The Religious Experience Research Unit. He and his co-researchers began to gather a unique archive of accounts of [[religious experience]] and to publish research into the area. The maintenance of both the archives and the research and publications have continued. The Centre organises conferences and produces both books and a series of Occasional Papers on religious experience and spirituality.

Sir Alister was awarded the ''[[Templeton Prize]] for Progress In Religion'' in 1985 and the Centre has since received a grant from the Templeton Foundation for the computerisation of the archives. The Centre was located at [[Manchester College, Oxford]] from 1969-1989 and from 1989–1999 at [[Westminster College, Oxford]]. In 2000 the Centre moved to the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]]
(presently University of Wales, Trinity Saint David). 

The directors of the Centre are currently Greg Barker, Bettina Schmidt and Sally Wilkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113909/http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/lrc/librariesandcentres/alisterhardyreligiousexperienceresearchcentre/contacts/ |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''religious name''' is a type of [[given name]] bestowed for a religious purpose, and which is generally used in religious contexts.  Different types of religious names may be in use among  [[clergy]] of a religion, as well in some cases among the [[laity]].

==Christianity==

===Catholic Church===

====Baptism name====
In [[baptism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] are given a [[Christian name]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Thurston |first=Herbert |title=Christian Names |year=1911 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |publication-place=[[New York City|New York]] |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should not be "foreign to Christian sentiment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7K.HTM#$295 Code of Canon Law, canon 2156]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often the name of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=207 Catholic Activity: Baptismal Names]&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asia, in Africa and elsewhere, the baptismal name is distinct from the traditional-style given name.

====Confirmation name====
In some countries, it is common to adopt a [[Confirmation#Confirmation name|confirmation name]], in addition to the baptismal name.

====Monastic and papal name====
In some [[religious institute]]s, a new member takes a [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] name. In Italian, a religious figure is often referred to by their religious name and by their secular name or their ''[[:it:al secolo]]'' name. A [[Papal election|newly elected]] [[Pope]] also takes on a new name, called his [[regnal name]] or [[papal name]].

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
====Baptism name====
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] converts often take a new name at the time of their reception into the church, either by [[baptism]] or [[chrismation]]. A person's religious name is always the name of a [[saint]], who then becomes that person's [[patron saint]]. When deciding on a name for their child, Orthodox parents will often name the child after a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] falls on either the day of the child's birth or the day of its baptism. Traditionally, Orthodox Christians celebrate their "[[name day]]" (i.e., the feast day of their patron saint), rather than their birthday.

====Monastic name====
Orthodox [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s are often given a new monastic name at the time of their [[tonsure]] (i.e., when they take their [[monastic vows]]). A monastic name is usually the name of a [[prophet]] or a [[monastic]] saint. Sometimes, the monastic name will begin with the same initial as the individual's baptismal name.

==Judaism==
[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] take a [[Hebrew name]] upon conversion.  Born Jews generally have a [[patronymic]] Hebrew name which is used for religious purposes; this is frequently different from their [[legal name]], especially when the latter is of [[gentile]] or non-Hebrew origin.

==Buddhism==
Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects also practice this, with newly ordained [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] often given new names by their master. Lay Buddhists are also given [[Dharma name]]s during their [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge ceremony]].

==Others==

===Gaudiya Vaishnavism===
Members of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] and some other [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] organisations are given a "spiritual name" by their [[guru]] upon initiation. This name ends in "Das" or "Dasa" for men and "Dasi" for women (meaning "servant"), and generally begins with the same letter as the devotee's given name.

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], a [[craft name]] is often used.

===Parody religions===
It is usual for a [[Discordianism#Episkopos|Discordian Episkopos]] to adopt a faux-mystical and bizarre name for the duration of the Episkoposity; such names are not immutable and are frequently adapted over time. The same is true for the clergy of the related [[Church of the SubGenius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">'''Singleness of [[Heart (symbol)|heart]]''' (also called '''singleheartedness''') is the ideal of having sole devotion to a task or endeavour.  It is normally employed in a religious or spiritual context.  In antiquity it was thought of as a counteraction to the divisive effects of civilization on the soul.  It is especially associated with the practices of [[Christian monasticism]].

Referring to the desert landscape inhabited by the earliest Christian monks, [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], in ''A History of Private Life'', explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The bleak, asocial landscape of the desert was a distant image of Paradise -- the first, the true home of humankind, where Adam and Eve had dwelt in full majesty, before the subtle and overpowering onset of the doublehearted cares of human life in settled society, before marriage, physical greed, the labor of the earth, and the grinding cares of present human society robbed them of their original serenity.  Totally singlehearted, therefore joined with the angelic hosts in unfailing and undivided praise of God, the life of the monk mirrored on earth the life of the angels.  &lt;small&gt;(''Paul Veyne, editor. Harvard: 1987. Volume I, p. 289'')&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Søren Kierkegaard expressed a similar concept in his maxim "Purity of heart is to will one thing" and his sermon-form essay bearing that title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topics/purity-heart-will-one-thing&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sobo''' is a spirit or [[loa]] in the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. He is the spirit of thunder and is always depicted and served with his inseparable companion/brother [[Bade (loa)|Bade]], who is the spirit of wind.

{{Refimprove|date=October 2006}}

A '''tablet''', in a religious context, is a term used for certain [[religious text]]s.

==In the Hebrew Bible==
{{main|Tablets of Stone}}
Judaism and Christianity maintain that [[Moses]] brought the [[Ten Commandments]] down from [[Mount Sinai]] in the form of two tablets of stone. According to the [[Book of Exodus]], God delivered the tablets twice, the first set having been smashed by Moses in his anger at the idol-worship of the Israelites.

==In Islam==
The Preserved Tablet (''al-Lawhu 'l-Mahfuz''), the heavenly preserved record of all that has happened and will happen, contains ''[[Predestination in Islam|qadar]]''. ''Qadar'' ({{lang-ar|قدر}}, [[Hans Wehr transliteration|transliterated]] ''qadar'', meaning "fate", "divine fore-ordainment", "predestination")&lt;ref name="Wehr"&gt;J. M. Cowan (ed.) (1976). ''The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic''. Wiesbaden, Germany: Spoken Language Services. {{ISBN|0-87950-001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the concept of [[Divinity|divine]] [[destiny]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/Qadar.htm|title=Qadar|work=missionislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Bahá'í Faith==
The term "tablet" is part of the title of many shorter [[Bahá'í literature|works]] of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], and his son and successor [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]].&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 2005|article=Lawhḥ| first1 = Moojan | last1 = Momen | authorlink= Moojan Momen |  author2 = Lawson, B.T. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/lawh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ghost Club''' is a [[paranormal investigation]] and research organization, founded in London in 1862.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;Peter Underwood (1978) "Dictionary of the Supernatural", Harrap Ltd., London, {{ISBN|0-245-52784-2}}, Page 144&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed to be the oldest such organization in the world.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; Since 1862 it has primarily investigated [[ghost|ghosts and hauntings]].

==History==

The club has its roots in [[Cambridge]] in 1855, where [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] began to discuss [[ghost]]s and [[Parapsychology|psychic phenomena]]. Launched officially in London in 1862, it counted [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] among its members.&lt;ref name=brock440&gt;{{cite book | title=William Crookes (1832-1919) and the commercialization of science | series=Science, technology, and culture, 1700-1945 | author=William Hodson Brock | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=0-7546-6322-1 | page=440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the club's earliest [[Ghost hunting|investigations]] was of the [[Davenport brothers]] and their "spirit cabinet" [[hoax]], the club challenging the Davenports' claim of contacting the dead.

The group continued to undertake practical investigations of [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] phenomena, a topic then in vogue, meeting to discuss ghostly subjects. The Ghost Club dissolved in the 1870s following the death of Dickens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1882 revitalisation===

The club was revived on [[All Saints Day]] 1882 by the medium [[Stainton Moses]] and [[Alaric Alfred Watts]].&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt; initially claiming to be the original founders, without acknowledging its origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostclub.org.uk/history.html|title=The Ghost Club History|publisher="Ghost Club" |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), with whom there was an initial overlap, was founded at a similar time.&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}} "Moses became one of the first vice-presidents and council members of the SPR"&lt;/ref&gt;

While the SPR was a body devoted to scientific study, the Ghost Club remained a selective and secretive organization of [[Spiritualism|convinced believers]] for whom psychic phenomena were an established fact.&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt; Stainton Moses resigned from the vice presidency of the SPR in 1886 and thereafter devoted himself to the Ghost Club. Membership was small (82 members over 54 years{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) and women were not allowed but during this period it attracted some of the most original and controversial minds in psychical research. These included Sir [[William Crookes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The spiritualists: the story of Florence Cook and William Crookes | first=Trevor H. | last=Hall | publisher=Helix Press | year=1963 | page=97n }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Nandor Fodor]] and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

The archives{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} of the Club reveal that the names of members, both living and dead, were solemnly recited each November 2. Each individual, living or dead, was recognized a member of the Club. On more than one occasion deceased members were believed to have made their presence felt.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Also involved were the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] (joined 1911) and [[Frederick Bligh Bond]] (joined 1925), who became infamous with his investigations into spiritualism at [[Glastonbury]]. Bligh Bond later left the country and became active in the [[American Society for Psychical Research]]. He was ordained into the [[Old Catholic Church]] and rejoined the Ghost Club on his return to Britain in 1935.

The Principal of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], Arthur Grey fictionalized the Ghost Club in 1919 as "The Everlasting Club"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0605771h.html |title=Read "The Everlasting Club" |publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a ghost story that many still believe to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/atp134tediousbrieftales.htm |title="Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye" by Arthur Grey |publisher=Ash-Tree Press |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythosbooks.com/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=54807&amp;CLSN_23=1246353232238b39aa06f9d73fa1f62e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714145228/http://www.mythosbooks.com/?page=shop%2Fflypage&amp;product_id=54807&amp;CLSN_23=1246353232238b39aa06f9d73fa1f62e |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-14 |title="Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye" by Arthur Grey |publisher=Mythos Books |date= |accessdate= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===

The 20th century's move from [[séance]] room investigation to laboratory-based research meant the Ghost Club fell out of touch with contemporary psychic research. [[Harry Price]], famous for his investigation into [[Borley Rectory]], joined as a member in 1927 as did psychologist [[Nandor Fodor]] who represented the changing approach to psychical research taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003858/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With attendance falling, the club closed in 1936 after 485 meetings. The Ghost Club records were deposited in the [[British Museum]] under the proviso that they would remain closed until 1962 out of respect for confidentiality.&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt;

Within 18 months, Price relaunched the Ghost Club as a society dining event where psychic researchers and mediums delivered after-dinner talks. Price decided to admit women to the club, also specifying that it was not a spiritualist church or association but a group of [[Skepticism|skeptics]] that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. Members in this period included {{nowrap|[[C. E. M. Joad]]}}, Sir [[Julian Huxley]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], Sir [[Osbert Sitwell]] and [[Frederick Montague, 1st Baron Amwell|Lord Amwell]].

Following Price's death in 1948, the club was again relaunched by members of the committee, Philip Paul and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]]. From 1962 Underwood served as President; many accounts of club activities are found in his books.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Tom Perrott]] joined the club in 1967 and served as Chairman from 1971 to 1993.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1993, the club underwent a period of internal disruption, during which Underwood left to become Life President of another society he had revived called "The Ghost Club Society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleofspirits.com/ghostclub.html The Ghost Club Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216181942/http://www.castleofspirits.com/ghostclub.html |date=2014-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghost Club later expanded its remit to include the study of [[UFO]]s, [[dowsing]], [[cryptozoology]] and similar topics.

===Recent history===

In 1998, Perrott resigned as chairman (although he remained active in club affairs), and [[barrister]] Alan Murdie was elected as his successor. Murdie has written a number of ghost books including ''Haunted [[Brighton]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britishlocalhistory.co.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=8770&amp;ProductID=1114 |title=Haunted Brighton |publisher=British Local History |date= |ISBN=978-0-7524-3829-0 |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regularly writes for ''[[Fortean Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ghostwatch/1035/yorkshire_ghost_busters.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314220116/http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ghostwatch/1035/yorkshire_ghost_busters.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-14 |title="Fortean Times" article by Alan Murdie |publisher=Fortean Times |date=March 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he was succeeded by Kathy Gearing, the club's first female chairperson. Gearing announced her resignation in the club's Summer 2009 newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;The Ghost Club newsletter, Summer 2009, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The club continues to meet monthly at the Victory Services Club near [[Marble Arch]], in London. Several investigations are performed in England every year. In recent times, investigations have been organised in [[Scotland]] by the club's Scottish Area Investigation Coordinator.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:Boehme Portrait 1730.jpeg|thumb|right|An idealised portrait of Jakob Böhme]]

'''Theosophy''', also known as '''Christian theosophy''' and '''Boehmian theosophy''', refers to a range of positions within [[Christianity]] which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of [[divinity]] and the origin and purpose of the universe.
They have been characterized as [[mystical]] and [[occult]]ist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Forward, to the East: Mapthali Herz Imber's Perception of Kabbalah|last=Huss|first=Boaz|year=2013|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|volume=12|issue=3|page=398|doi=10.1080/14725886.2013.826464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy is considered part of [[Western esotericism]], which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and salvation.

The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher [[Jakob Böhme]].

In 1875, the term "theosophy" was adopted and revived by the [[Theosophical Society]], an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt; "Following a period of obscurity, it was then revived at the end of the nineteenth century by the Russian occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky" Partridge, C. (2013). Understanding the Dark Side. Chester: University of Chester. page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.

==Etymology and terminology==
Theosophy comes from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|theosophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|θεοσοφία}}), which combines ''{{lang|grc|theos}}'' (θεός), "God"&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott: ''Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{lang|grc|sophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|σοφία}}), "wisdom". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theosophy |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/theosophy |website=Encylopedia.com |publisher=Encylopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymological meaning is thus "wisdom of God."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}} 

The term ''theosophia'' appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early [[church fathers]], as a synonym for [[theology]]:{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name = "Lobel"&gt;{{harvnb|Lobel|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''theosophoi'' are "those knowing divine things".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "theosophos" (θεόσοφος) "wise in divine things" was applied by [[Iamblichus]] to the [[gymnosophists]] (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian [[yogi]]s or [[sadhu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]] (''De mysteriis'' 7.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of esotericism such as [[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin]] and [[Antoine Faivre|Faivre]] differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by [[Helena Blavatsky]] by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt;

Antoine Faivre suggested that it be called "Boehmian theosophy".{{sfn|Faivre|1998|p=116}}

==Historical development==
{{see also|Transcendent theosophy}}
===Antiquity and medieval ending c. 1450 CE===
The term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name = "Lobel" /&gt; The 13th century work ''[[Summa philosophiae]]'' attributed to [[Robert Grosseteste]] made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Origen]] were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
During the [[Renaissance]], use of the term diverged to refer to [[gnostic]] knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and [[Pietism]] arose in response to the orthodoxy of the [[Lutheran Reformation]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=87}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[I]n the first decades of the seventeenth century, the German cobbler Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) wrote an oeuvre of impressive depth and originality that has become foundational for one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism: Christian theosophy. In a heartfelt attempt to understand how a good God could have created a world so full of evil and suffering, Böhme developed a dramatic visionary cosmogony filled with alchemical and Paracelsian references, that described the 'birth of God' himself out of the unfathomable mysteries of the ''Ungrund''."|source=— Religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} }}

The work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic [[Jakob Boehme]] (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word "theosophy", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13, see also p.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Boehme gave the word "theosophy" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating [[nature]] with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehme's work has been described as being "foundational" for Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=10–11 Faivre's list of 17th century theosophers in North-Western Europe (including Germany) consists of roughly ten names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1618–1699), [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637), [[John Pordage]] (1608–1681), [[Jane Leade]] (1623–1704), [[Henry More]] (1614–1687), [[Pierre Poiret]] (1646–1719), and [[Antoinette Bourignon]] (1616–1680).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=10-11 Henry More is added to the list by Faivre with some reservations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying [[active imagination]] in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OED|1989|}} v. XVII, p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in [[ancient Egypt]], and to [[Neo-Platonism]], and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term "theosophy" was still "practically absent" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=47 (Diderot is the one exception Faivre mentions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Jakob Brucker]] (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work {{cite book|title=Historia critica philosophia}} (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word ''theosophy'' was often used in conjunction with {{clarify span|panosophy, i.e., a knowledge of divine things that is acquired by deciphering the supposed hieroglyphics of the concrete universe.|explain=panosophy vs. pansophy?|date=January 2015}} The term ''theosophy'' is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Robert Hindmarsh]], a printer with a Methodist background, formed a "Theosophical Society" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Hindmarsh, Robert, ''Rise and Progress of The New Jerusalem Church In England, America and Other Parts,'' Hoderson and Sons, London 1861; {{ISBN|1-4021-3146-1}}.

Groups such as the [[Martinist Order]] founded by [[Papus]] in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: "although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemeth IEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

Faivre stated that "Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=23}}

Theosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the "theosophic current" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought  (i.e., [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], Neo-Alexandrian [[hermetism|Hermeticism]], [[Christian Kabbalah]], Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the "prognostications" of [[Paracelsus]]), [[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|philosophia occulta]] and [[Rosicrucianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faivre noted that there are "obvious similarities" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier  theosophy "belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type", while that of modern Theosophy "reveals a more universal aspect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences "are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern theosophy retains its western Hermetic motive, logic and end.... The continuities are greater than the differences." Handbook of the Theosophical Current , Olav Hammer, Mikael Rothstein, BRILL, 2013 {{ISBN|9789004235977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. [[Antoine Faivre]] notes, "the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail."&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt; The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Faivre identified three characteristics of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.

''Theosophy'':
# Divine/Human/Nature Triangle: The inspired analysis which circles through these three angles. The intradivine within; the origin, death and placement of the human relating to Divinity and Nature; Nature as alive, the external, intellectual and material. All three complex correlations synthesize via the intellect and imaginative processes of Mind.  
# Primacy of the Mythic: The creative Imagination, an external world of symbols, glyphs, myths, synchronicities and the myriad, along with image, all as a universal reality for the interplay conjoined by creative mind.
# Access to Supreme Worlds: The awakening within, inherently possessing the faculty to directly connect to the Divine world(s). The existence of a special human ability to create this connection. The ability to connect and explore all levels of reality; co-penetrate the human with the divine; to bond to all reality and experience a unique inner awakening.

==Legacy and reception==

The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] described Christian theosophy as "one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} 

===Academic study===

Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=31, also xxx.(Preface)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] and Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=6}}
Scholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic ''Naturphilosophie'' and therefore creates an "ideal" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=11}}

{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}

In [[religion]], '''transcendence''' refers to the aspect of a [[deity]]'s nature and power that is wholly independent of the material [[universe]], beyond all known [[physical law]]s. This is contrasted [[immanence]], where a god is said to be fully present in the physical world and thus accessible to creatures in various ways. In [[religious experience]] transcendence is a state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and by some definitions has also become independent of it. This is typically manifested in  [[prayer]], [[séance]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s and [[paranormal]] "visions".

It is affirmed in various religious traditions' concept of the [[divinity|divine]], which contrasts with the notion of a [[god]] (or, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]) that exists exclusively in the physical order ([[immanence|immanentism]]), or indistinguishable from it ([[pantheism]]). Transcendence can be attributed to the divine not only in its being, but also in its knowledge. Thus, a god may transcend both the universe and knowledge (is beyond the grasp of the human mind).

Although transcendence is defined as the opposite of [[immanence]], the two are not necessarily [[mutually exclusive]]. Some [[theology|theologians]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] of various religious traditions affirm that a god is both within and beyond the universe ([[panentheism]]); in it, but not of it; simultaneously pervading it and surpassing it.

==View by religion==
===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] believe in a [[Monotheism|single]], imperishable [[god]], the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1988 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | location = Chicago | isbn = 0-85229-486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Bahá'í tradition, god is described as "a personal god, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA
 |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-9.html#gr26 | page= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose.  Bahá'ís believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] or sometimes ''divine educators''.&lt;ref name="eor"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Bahá'í teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, nor to create a complete and accurate image.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages =1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]] "transcendence", by definition, belongs to the mortal beings of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Formless Realm (Ārūpyadhātu)|formless realms]] of existence. However, although such beings are at 'the peak' of [[Samsara]], Buddhism considers the development of transcendence to be both temporary and a spiritual cul-de-sac, which therefore does not eventuate a permanent cessation of Samsara. This assertion was a primary differentiator from the other [[Sramana]] teachers during [[Gautama Buddha]]'s own training and development.&lt;ref&gt;Ariyapariyesana Sutta - "'This Dhamma (of Alara Kalama) leads not to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness (one of the four states of formlessness).'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, in the various forms of Buddhism—Theravada, Mahayana (especially Pure Land and Zen) and Vajrayana—the notion of transcendence sometimes includes a [[soteriological]] application. Except for Pure Land and Vajrayana, the role played by transcendent beings is minimal and at most a temporary expedient. However some Buddhists believe that [[Nirvana]] is an eternal, transcendental state beyond name and form, so for these Buddhists, Nirvana is the main concept of transcendence. The more usual interpretation of Nirvana in Buddhism is that it is a cessation—a permanent absence of something (namely suffering), and therefore it is not in any way a state which could be considered transcendent.

Primordial enlightenment and the dharma are sometimes portrayed as transcendent, since they can surpass all samsaric obstructions.

===Christianity===
{{Attributes of God}}
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
The Catholic Church, as do other Christian Churches, holds that God transcends all creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#35/z Catechism of the Catholic Church §§42, 212]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], "...concerning God, we cannot grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, Thomas. SCG I, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropomorphic depictions of God are largely metaphorical and reflect the challenge of "human modes of expression" in attempting to describe the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#35/z CCC §43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] observed "...[I]t is only by the use of such human expressions that Scripture can make its many kinds of readers whom it wants to help to feel, as it were, at home."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 15, 25&lt;/ref&gt; The "sense of transcendence" and therefore, an awareness of the "sacred", is an important component of the liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincolndiocese.org/op-ed/bcwriting/102-reflecting-on-transcendence-in-the-liturgy-the-new-translation-of-the-mass-and-what-will-it-mean-for-us Conley, James D., "Reflecting on Transcendence in the Liturgy", ''southern Nebraska Register'']&lt;/ref&gt; God is recognized as both transcendent and [[Immanence|immanent]].

===Hinduism===
Transcendence is described and viewed from a number of diverse perspectives in [[Hinduism]]. Some traditions, such as [[Advaita Vedanta]], view transcendence in the form of God as the [[Nirguna Brahman]] (God without attributes), transcendence being absolute. Other traditions, such as [[Bhakti yoga]], view transcendence as God with attributes ([[Saguna Brahman]]), the Absolute being a personal deity ([[Ishvara]]), such as [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]].

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] transcendence is described as a level of spiritual attainment, or state of being which is open to all spiritual aspirants (the goal of [[yoga]] practice), the state at which one is no longer under the control of animalistic, base desires and is aware of a higher spiritual reality.
{{quote|When the [[yogi|yogī]], by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in transcendence — devoid of all material desires — he is said to be well established in yoga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/6/18/en1 BG 6.18] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118000234/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/6/18/en1 |date=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exact nature of this transcendence is given as being "above the modes of material nature", which are known as ''[[gunas]]'' (ropes) which bind the living entity to the world of ''[[samsara]]'' (repeated rebirth) in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/14/22-25/en1 BG 14.22-25] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303001808/http://www.bhagavadgitaasitis.com/14/22-25/en1 |date=3 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Tawhid|Tanzih}}
''Tawhid'' is the act of believing and affirming that [[God]] (Arabic: [[Allah]]) is one and unique (''wāḥid''). The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the entire creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp.3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Say: He is God, the One and Only;  God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him." (Sura {{cite quran|112|1-4|style=nosup|expand=no}}, ''Yusuf Ali'') &lt;br&gt;Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were God's will, God could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom God will as your successors, even as God raised you up from the posterity of other people." (Sura {{cite quran|6|133|style=nosup|expand=no}}, ''Yusuf Ali'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Vincent J. Cornell, the Qur'an also provides a [[monism|monist]] image of God by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things:"God is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward; God is the Knower of everything (Sura {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}})"&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt; All Muslims have however vigorously criticized interpretations that would lead to a monist view of God for what they see as blurring the distinction between the creator and the creature, and its incompatibility with the radical monotheism of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Gottlie (2006), p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to explain the complexity of unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur'an uses 99 terms referred to as "Most Beautiful Names of Allah" (Sura 77:180)[12]. Aside from the supreme name "Allah" and the neologism al-Rahman (referring to the divine beneficence that constantly  (re)creates, maintains and destroys the universe), other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God's [[immanence]] rather than being a sign of one's divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God's transcendent nature.

Tawhid or Oneness of God constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;D. Gimaret, ''Tawhid'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Qur'an.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;Asma Barlas (2003-2007) Believing Women in Islam. University of Texas Press, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Ramadan (2005), p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
[[Jewish]] theologians, especially since the [[Middle Ages]], have described the transcendence of God in terms of [[divine simplicity]], explaining the traditional characteristics of God as [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]].  Interventions of divine transcendence occur in the form of events outside the realm of natural occurrence such as [[miracle]]s and the [[revelation]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] to [[Moses]] at [[Mt. Sinai]].

In Jewish [[Kabbalistic]] [[cosmology]], God is described as the "[[Ein Sof]]" (literally, without end) as reference to God's divine simplicity and essential unknowability. The emanation of creation from the Ein Sof is explained through a process of filtering. In the Kabbalistic [[creation myth]] referred to as the "breaking of the vessels," filtering was necessary because otherwise this intense, simple essence would have overwhelmed and made impossible the emergence of any distinct creations. Each filter, described as a vessel, captured the emanation of this creative force until it was overwhelmed and broken by the intensity of God's simple essence. Once broken, the vessel's shards, full of absorbed "divine sparks," fell into a vessel below. This process ultimately continued until the "light" of Godliness was sufficiently reduced to allow the world we inhabit to be sustained without breaking. The creation of this world, however, comes with the consequence that Godly transcendence is hidden, or "exiled" (from the immanent world). Only through the revelation of sparks hidden within the shards embedded in our material world can this transcendence be recognized again. In [[Hasidic]] thought, divine sparks are revealed through the performance of commandments or "[[mitzvot]]," (literally, the obligations and prohibitions described in the [[Torah]]). A Kabbalistic explanation for the existence of malevolence in the world is that such terrible things are possible with the divine sparks being hidden. Thus there is some urgency to performing mitzvot in order to liberate the hidden sparks and perform a "[[tikkun olam]]" (literally, healing of the world). Until then, the world is presided over by the immanent aspect of God, often referred to as the [[Shekhinah]] or divine spirit, and in feminine terms.

===Sikhism===
'''[[Waheguru]]''' ({{lang-pa|ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ}}, ''{{IAST|Vāhigurū}}'') is a term most often used in [[Sikhism]] to refer to [[God]], the [[Supreme Being]] or the creator of all. It means "Wonderful Teacher" in the Punjabi language, but in this case is used to refer to the Sikh God. ''Wahi'' means "wonderful" (a Middle Persian borrowing) and "[[Guru]]" ({{lang-sa|गुरु}}) is a term denoting "teacher". Waheguru is also described by some{{According to whom|date=August 2014}} as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions.

Cumulatively, the name implies wonder at the Divine Light eliminating spiritual darkness. It might also imply, "Hail the Lord whose name eliminates spiritual darkness." Earlier, [[Shaheed Bhai Mani Singh]], ''Sikhan di Bhagat Mala'', gave a similar explication, also on the authority of [[Guru Nanak]]. Considering the two constituents of "Vahiguru" ("vahi" + "guru") implying the state of wondrous ecstasy and offering of homage to the Lord, the first one was brought distinctly and prominently into the devotional system by Guru Nanak, who has made use of this interjection, as in [[Majh ki Var]] (stanza 24), and [[Suhi ki Var]], [[sloka meter|sloka]] to [[pauri]] 10.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Sikh doctrine identifies one panentheistic god (Ek Onkar) who is omnipresent and has infinite qualities, whose name is true (Satnam), can do anything (Karta purkh), has no fear (Nirb  hau), is not the enemy of anyone (Nirvair), is beyond time (Akaal), has no image (Murat), is beyond birth and death circulation (Ajunee), is self-existent (Sai Bhang) and possesses the grace of word guru (eternal light) we can meet him (Gurprasaad). Sikhs do not identify a gender for Ek Onkar, nor do they believe it takes a human form. In the Sikh tradition, all human beings are considered equal regardless of their religion, sex, or race. All are sons and daughters of Waheguru, the Almighty.&lt;ref name="Heartbeat"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ek-Onkar-Satnam-Heartbeat-Nanak/dp/1477214267/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384679886&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Ek+Onkar+Satnam%3A+The+Heartbeat+of+Nanak | title=Ek Onkar Satnam: The Heartbeat of Nanak | publisher=AuthorHouseUK | author=Taoshobuddha | date=22 Aug 2012 |page=438 | isbn=1-4772-1426-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "death of God" and the end of transcendence in secular culture==
{{See also|God is dead|Richard L. Rubenstein}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
In 1961, Christian theologian [[Gabriel Vahanian]]'s published ''The Death of God''. Vahanian argued that modern secular culture had lost all sense of the sacred, lacking any sacramental meaning, no transcendental purpose or sense of providence. He concluded that for the modern secular mind "God is dead", but he did not mean that God did not exist. In Vahanian's vision a transformed post-Christian and post-modern culture was needed to create a renewed experience of deity.

Paul Van Buren and William Hamilton both agreed that the concept of transcendence had lost any meaningful place in modern secular thought. According to the norms of contemporary modern secular thought, God is dead. In responding to this denial of transcendence Van Buren and Hamilton offered secular people the option of Jesus as the model human who acted in love. The encounter with the Christ of faith would be open in a church-community.

[[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] offered a radical theology of the death of God that drew upon [[William Blake]], Hegelian thought and Nietzschean ideas. He conceived of theology as a form of poetry in which the immanence (presence) of God could be encountered in faith communities. However, he no longer accepted the possibility of affirming his belief in a transcendent God. Altizer concluded that God had incarnated in Christ and imparted his immanent spirit which remained in the world even though Jesus was dead. It is important that such ideas are understood as socio-cultural developments and not as ontological realities. As Vahanian expressed it in his book, the issue of the denial of God lies in the mind of secular man, not in reality.

Critiquing the death of God theology, Joseph Papin, the founder of the Villanova Theology Institute, noted: "Rumbles of the new theology of the 'Requiem for God," (theologians of the death of God) proved to be a totally inadequate foundation for spanning a theological river with a bridge.  The school of the theology of the "Requiem of God," not even implementing a "Requiem for Satan," will constitute only a footnote to the history of theology. . . . 'The Grave of God,' was the death rattle for the continuancy of the aforementioned school without any noticeable echo." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Post-Conciliar Perspectives," The Dynamic in Christian Thought|last=Papin|first=Joseph|publisher=Villanova University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Piet Schoonenberg (Nijmegen, Netherlands) directly critiqued Altizer concluding: "Rightly understood the transcendence of God does not exclude His immanence, but includes it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Transcendence of God, Part I," Transcendence and Immanence, Reconstruction in the Light of Process Thinking, Festschrift in Honor of Joseph Papin, ed. Joseph Armenti|last=Schoonenberg|first=Piet|publisher=Abbey Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schoonenberg went on to say: "We must take God's transcendence seriously by not imposing any limits whatsoever, not even the limits that our images or concepts of transcendence evoke. This however occurs when God's transcendence is expressed as elevated over the world to the exclusion of his presence in this world; when his independence is expressed by excluding his real relation and reaction to the world; or when we insist upon his unchangeable eternity to the exclusion of his real partnership in human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="From Transcendence to Immanence, Part II," Wisdom and Knowledge, Essays in Honor of Joseph Papin, ed.

== Historical ==

The influential Massachusetts preacher [[Cotton Mather]] was the first known person to attempt [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with [[Edward Jenner]], the pioneer of smallpox [[vaccination]], and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to.&lt;ref name="Bazin2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Bazin|title=The eradication of smallpox: Edward Jenner and the first and only eradication of a human infectious disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bPuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=19 January 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-083475-4|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a tract on the subject in 1806,&lt;ref name="GlynnGlynn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Glynn|author2=Jenifer Glynn|title=The Life and Death of Smallpox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tL4W3YNMYLIC&amp;pg=PA112|date=30 August 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84542-7|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when many medical men refused to sanction it. Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. [[John C. Lettsom]], an eminent [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] physician of the day wrote to Rowland Hill commenting:

: "You have done more good than you imagine; and for everyone you may have saved by your actual operation, you have saved ten by your example; and perhaps, next to [[Edward Jenner|Jenner]], have been the means of saving more lives than any other individual."&lt;ref name="Rhodes2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rhodes|title=The End of Plagues: The Global Battle Against Infectious Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdRWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=24 September 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-38131-6|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Boston]] clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Mindell, The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007 [2006]), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Theological opposition to inoculation, vaccination, and the use of anæsthetics |title= A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |author= Andrew Dickson White |publisher=Appleton |year= 1896 |chapterurl=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Pétursson P |year=1983 |title= Church and Social Change: A Study of the Secularization Process in Iceland, 1830–1930 |series= Studies in religious experience and behaviour, nr. 4 |location= Helsingborg, Sweden |publisher= Plus Ultra |pages= 70, 79 |isbn=91-970355-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When vaccination was introduced into [[United Kingdom|UK]] public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;Durbach, Nadja. 2005. ''Bodily matters: the anti-vaccination movement in England, 1853–1907''. Radical perspectives. Durham: Duke University Press. pp 40–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-vaccinationists]] were most common in Protestant countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdelais, Patrice. 2006.'' Epidemics laid low: a history of what happened in rich countries.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press.  pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Boyd RW | title=The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline Among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774–1874 | year=1999 | publisher= University of Washington Press | location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97837-6 |chapter= A final disaster: the 1862 smallpox epidemic in coastal British Columbia |pages=172–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a number of [[Vaccination Acts]] were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when [[variolation|smallpox inoculation]] was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination  enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in [[Leicester]], a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898  Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the "[[conscientious objector]]" in English law. &lt;!-- see Talk and Hansard--&gt;A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] banned their members from receiving vaccinations from 1931 to 1952. They have since reversed their position. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to the individual Witness. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness6.htm About the Jehovah's Witnesses Christian denomination - Past opposition to vaccinations], religioustolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[fetal tissue in vaccines|fetal tissue in the development of vaccines]] has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to [[abortion]]. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the [[rubella]] vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/assets/files/pdfs/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |format=PDF |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems."&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year= 2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher= Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url= http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo/vacc/vacc&amp;lang=english |accessdate= 2008-12-03 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060507072740/http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo%2Fvacc%2Fvacc&amp;lang=english |archivedate= 2006-05-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."&lt;ref name=Vatican/&gt;

===Political opposition to vaccination by religious groups===

The majority of Orthodox Rabbis view vaccination as a religious obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/news/statement-vaccinations-ou-rabbinical-council-america/|title=Statement on Vaccinations from the OU and Rabbinical Council of America|publisher=Orthodox Union|date=2015-02-10|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A magazine called P.E.A.C.H. that presented an anti-immunization message to Orthodox Jews was distributed in Brooklyn, New York in early 2014. This is not a widespread phenomenon though. 96% of students at Yeshivas (who are essentially all Orthodox Jewish) in New York City were immunized according to information obtained in 2014, although this is a lower than average rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/205801/are-ultra-orthodox-turning-away-from-vaccination/?p=all|title=Are Ultra-Orthodox Turning Away From Vaccination?|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|work=Forward|date=2014-09-17|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 imams in northern [[Nigeria]] advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29781528/ns/health-infectious_diseases/t/muslim-clerics-finally-embrace-polio-campaign/#.VQC3WIF4qcY|title=Muslim Clerics Finally Embrace Polio Campaign|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries. The followers were also wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005.&lt;ref name=Clements&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Curr Drug Saf |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=117–19 |title=How vaccine safety can become political – the example of polio in Nigeria |vauthors=Clements CJ, Greenough P, Shull D |url=http://bentham.org/cds/samples/cds1-1/Clements.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-28 |doi=10.2174/157488606775252575 |pmid=18690921 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030913/http://bentham.org/cds/samples/cds1-1/Clements.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild poliovirus 2000–2008 |date=2008-02-05 |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Global Polio Eradication Initiative |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204139/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in [[Borno State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Hundreds' dead in measles outbreak |publisher=IRIN |date=2007-12-14 |url=http://irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75883 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, nine health workers administering polio vaccine were targeted and killed by gunmen on motorcycles in [[Kano]], but this was an isolated incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21381773|title=Polio vaccinators killed in Nigeria|date=8 February 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-33650543 | work=BBC News | title=Nigeria marks one year without recorded polio case | date=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local traditional and religious leaders and polio survivors worked to support the vaccination campaign,&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/23/us-health-polio-nigeria-idUSKCN0PX2RF20150723 | work=Reuters | title=Nigeria marks polio-free year, raising global eradication hopes | date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nigeria has not had a polio case since July 24, 2014; in 2017, if no new cases appear, Nigeria will be declared polio-free.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Exemptions ==

In the U.S., all states except Mississippi, California and West Virginia allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in [[Massachusetts]], the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/07363761111181464|title=Against medical advice: the anti-consumption of vaccines|date=|website=|publisher=The University of Auckland Business School, Auckland, New Zealand|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-19819928_x.htm |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |author= LeBlanc S |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |title= Parents use religion to avoid vaccines |work= USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Medical Association]] opposes such exemptions, saying that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf |author= American Medical Association |title= Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA House of Delegates |quote= H-440.970 Religious Exemptions from Immunizations |format=PDF |pages=460–61 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2016 Australia introduced legislation that removed eligibility for childcare and welfare benefits if parents refuse to vaccinate their children, removing religious exemptions at the same time as the only religion to apply for an exemption (Church of Christ Science) deemed their exemption to no longer be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/no-jab-no-pay-reforms-religious-exemptions-for-vaccination-dumped/news-story/5941541520ab64a115704f58633a1d68 | title=religious exemption removed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''''Wu''''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years.

==The word ''wu''==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' {{linktext|巫}} "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be of either sex. During the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' was used to specify "female shaman; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "male shaman; sorcerer" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include ''nanwu'' 男巫 for "male shaman; sorcerer; wizard"; and ''nüwu'' 女巫, ''wunü'' 巫女, ''wupo'' 巫婆, and ''wuyu'' 巫嫗 for "female shaman; sorceress; witch".

''Wu'' is used in compounds like ''[[Gu (poison)|wugu]]'' 巫蠱 "sorcery; cast harmful spells", ''wushen'' 巫神 or ''shenwu'' 神巫 (with [[Shen (Chinese religion)|''shen'']] "spirit; god") "wizard; sorcerer", and ''wuxian'' 巫仙 (with [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] "immortal; alchemist") "immortal shaman".

The word ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' 童乩 (lit. "youth diviner") "shaman; spirit-medium" is a near-synonym of ''wu''. Chinese uses phonetic [[transliteration into Chinese characters|transliteration]] to distinguish native ''wu'' from "[[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shaman]]": ''saman'' 薩滿 or ''saman'' 薩蠻. "Shaman" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of [[Shramana]] "wandering monk; ascetic": ''shamen'' 沙門, ''sangmen'' 桑門, or ''sangmen'' 喪門.

[[Joseph Needham]] (1954:134) suggests "shaman" was transliterated ''xianmen'' 羨門 in the name of [[Zou Yan]]'s disciple Xianmen Gao 羨門高 (or Zigao 子高). He quotes the ''[[Shiji]]'' that Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210 BCE), "wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "immortals", [''xianmen''], and the like." Needham (1954:134) compares two later Chinese terms for "shaman": ''shanman'' 珊蛮, which described the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Wanyan Xiyin]], and ''sizhu'' 司祝, which was used for imperial [[Manchu]] shamans during the [[Qing Dynasty]].

===Translations===
''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences."

===Pronunciations===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 巫 is ''wu'', which [[historical Chinese phonology|phonologically]] descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''wu'' 巫: ''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wo'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]), ''mjuo'' &lt; *''{{IPA|mjwaɣ}}'' (Zhou Fagao), *''mjag'' ([[Li Fanggui]]), ''mju'' &lt; *''ma'' (Axel Schuessler), and *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' ([[Victor H. Mair]]) . Linguists disagree whether ''wu'' had an Old Chinese [[velar]] final ''-g'' or ''-ɣ''. This 巫 is pronounced ''mouh'' in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], ''vu'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], ''mu'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], and ''fu'' or ''[[miko]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

===Characters===

The contemporary [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] for ''wu'' combines the graphic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] ''gong'' [[Wikt:工|工]] "work" and ''ren'' [[Wikt:人|人]] "person" doubled (cf. ''cong'' [[Wikt:从|从]]). This 巫 character developed from [[Seal script]] characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from [[Bronzeware script]] and [[Oracle bone script]] characters that resembled a [[cross potent]].

The first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''wu'' as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:祝|祝]] "sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest" (祝也 女能以舞降神者也 象从工 两人舞形, tr. Hopkins 1920:432) and analyzes the Seal graph, "An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing."  This Seal graph for ''wu'' is interpreted as showing "the 工 work of two dancing figures set to each other – a shamanistic dance" (Karlgren 1923:363) or "two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)" (Schafer 1951:153).

This dictionary also includes a variant [[Great Seal script]] (called a ''guwen'' "ancient script") that elaborates ''wu'' 巫.  Hopkins (1920:433) analyzes this ''guwen'' graph as ''gong'' 廾 "two hands held upward" at the bottom (like ''shi'' 筮's Seal graph) and two "mouths" with the "sleeves" on the sides; or (1920:424) "jade" because the ''Shuowen'' defines ''ling'' 靈 "spiritual; divine" as synonymous with ''wu'' and depicting (巫以玉事神, tr. Hopkins 1920:424), "an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade."

Schafer (1951:154) compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for ''wu'' and ''nong'' [[Wikt:弄|弄]] "play with; cause" (written with 玉 "jade" over 廾 "two hands") that shows "hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form 巫 may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph."

Tu Baikui 塗白奎 (quoted by Boileau 2002:354) believes the ''wu'' oracle character "was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination." Citing Li Xiaoding 李孝定 that ''gong'' 工 originally pictured a "carpenter's square", Allan (1991:77) argues that oracle inscriptions used ''wu'' 巫 interchangeably with ''fang'' [[Wikt:方|方]] "square; side; place" for sacrifices to the ''sifang'' 四方 "four directions".

This 巫 component is semantically significant in several characters:
*''wu'' [[Wikt:誣|誣]] (with the "speech radical" 言) "deceive; slander; falsely accuse"
*''shi'' [[Wikt:筮|筮]] (with the "bamboo radical" 竹) "[[Achillea millefolium]] (used for divination)"
*''xi'' [[Wikt:覡|覡]] (with the "vision radical" 見) "male shaman; male sorcerer"
*''ling'' [[Wikt:靈|靈]] (with the "cloud radical" 雨 and three 口 "mouths" or "raindrops") "spirit; divine; clever"
*''yi'' [[Wikt:毉|毉]] "doctor", which is an old "shaman" [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ''yi'' [[Wikt:醫|醫]] (with the "wine radical" 酉)

===Meanings===
The comprehensive ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' dictionary (1989 1:412) lists five meanings of ''wu'' 巫, translatable as:
#"[[Mediumship|spirit medium]]; [[shaman]]; [[Witchcraft|witch]]; [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]"
#"[[witch doctor]]; [[medicine man]]"
#"mountain name"
#"[[Toponym|place name]]"
#"[[Wu (surname)|surname]]"
The former two "shaman" and "doctor" ''wu'' meanings are discussed below in detail. The latter three "[[proper name]]" meanings of apply to mountains, places, and people. ''[[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan]]'' [[Wikt:|巫山]] "Wu Mountain" is located near [[Chongqing]] in [[Sichuan]] Province. In Chinese, it is known through the [[Chengyu|four-character idiom]] ''Wushanyunyu'' 巫山雲雨 (with "clouds and rain") "lovers' rendezvous; coitus" (for example, see ''[[Rain Clouds over Wushan]]''). In English, Wu Mountain is known as the archeological site where [[Wushan Man]] "taxon of ''[[Homo erectus]]''" was discovered. Two nearby place names are ''[[Wuxi County|Wuxi]]'' 巫溪 (Wu Stream) and ''[[Wu Gorge]]'' (Wuxia 巫峽), which is in the [[Yangtze River]]'s [[Three Gorges]] region. The [[Chinese surname]] ''Wu'' goes back to the Shang Dynasty (for example, legendary [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸), but is comparatively uncommon today (but does appear, for example, in the name of recording artist Wu Qixian 巫啟賢 "[[Eric Moo]]"). Wuma 巫馬 (lit. "shaman horse") is both a [[Chinese compound surname]] (for example, the Confucian disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Wuma Shi|Wuma Shi/Qi]] 巫馬施/期) and a name for "horse shaman; equine veterinarian" (for example, the ''Zhouli'' official).

===Etymologies===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] hypothetically connect the [[etymology]] of Chinese ''wu'' "spirit medium; shaman" not only with [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages, but also with [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language groups.

[[Berthold Laufer]] (1917:370) proposed a relation between [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''bügä'' "shaman", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bögü'' "shaman", "Chinese ''bu'', ''wu'' (shaman), ''buk'', ''puk'' (to divine), and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''aba'' (pronounced ''ba'', sorcerer)".

Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root **''{{IPA|mjaɣ}}'' "magician; sorcerer" for Chinese ''wu'' &lt; ''mju'' &lt; *''mjag'' 巫 "magician; shaman" and [[Tibetan script|Written Tibetan]]'' 'ba'-po'' "sorcerer" and'' 'ba'-mo'' "sorcereress" (of the [[Bön]] religion).

Schuessler (2007:516) notes Chinese ''xian'' &lt; ''sjän'' &lt; *''sen'' [[仙]] "transcendent; immortal; alchemist" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan ''gšen'' "shaman" and [[Thai language|Thai]] {{IPA-th|mɔɔ|}} &lt; Proto-Tai *''{{IPA|hmɔ}}'' "doctor; sorcerer". In addition, the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and Proto-Western-Austronesian  *''{{IPA|səmaŋ}}'' "shaman" may also be connected with ''wu''. Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies.

First, ''wu'' could be the same word as ''wu'' 誣 "to deceive" (Karlgren 1923:363). Schuessler notes a Written Tibetan semantic parallel between "magical power" and "deceive": ''sprul-ba'' "to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power" cognate with {{IPA-bo|pʰrul|}} "magical deception".

[[File:Tomb brick g.JPG|thumb|Han Dynasty tomb-tile showing "long-sleeved dancers" and attendants.]]
Second, ''wu'' could be cognate with ''wu'' [[Wikt:舞|舞]] "to dance". Based on analysis of ancient characters, Hopkins (1920, 1945) proposed that ''wu'' 巫 "shaman", ''wu'' [[Wikt:無|無]] "not have; without", and ''wu'' 舞 "dance", "can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the [[thaumaturgic]] powers of his inspired personality" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing "long-sleeved dancers" performing at funerals, who Erickson (1994:52-54) identifies as shamans, citing the ''Shuowen jiezi'' that early ''wu'' characters depicted a dancer's sleeves.

Third, ''wu'' could also be cognate with ''mu'' 母 "mother" since ''wu'', as opposed to ''xi'' 覡, were typically female. [[Edward H. Schafer|Edward Schafer]] associates ''wu'' shamanism with fertility rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Linguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word ''wu'' (*''myu'') "shamanka" and such words as "mother", "dance", "fertility", "egg", and "receptacle". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands – a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles. (1973:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jensen (1995:421) cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静's hypothesis that the mother of [[Confucius]] was a ''wu''.

[[Image:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|Cross potent]]
Fourth, ''wu'' could be a loanword from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] *''maguš'' "magi; magician" (cf. [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''mogu''), meaning an "able one; specialist in ritual". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese ''wu'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' 巫 "shaman; witch, wizard; magician" was a [[loanword]] from [[Old Persian]] *''maguš'' "magician; [[magi]]".

Mair connects the nearly identical Chinese Bronze script for ''wu'' 巫 (above) and Western [[heraldic]] [[cross potent]] '''☩''', an ancient symbol of a ''magi'' or ''magician'', for which both words were ultimately borrowed from the same Iranian word.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair, “The Earliest Identifiable Written Chinese Character”, ''Archaeology and Language: Indo-European Studies Presented to James P. Mallory'', eds. Martin E. Huld, Karlene Jones-Bley &amp; Dean Miller (Washington, D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man, 2012), 265–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early records of ''wu''==
The oldest written records of ''wu'' are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning the historical origin of the ''wu'', we may ask: were they a remnant of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two reasons: first, the most abundant data about the ''wu'' are to be found in Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of the Eastern Zhou ''wu'' are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there is no mention of the Shang character ''wu''. Moreover, because of the scarcity of information, many of the activities of the Zhou ''wu'' cannot be traced back to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. (2002:376) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Wu'' in Shang oracular inscriptions===
Shima's (1971:418) concordance of oracle inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character ''wu'': 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly 巫帝 "''wu'' spirit/sacrifice" and 氐巫 "bring the ''wu'') and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. Boileau (2002:354-5) differentiates four meanings of these oracular ''wu'':
#"a spirit, ''wu'' of the north or east, to which sacrifices are offered"
#"a sacrifice, possibly linked to controlling the wind or meteorology"
#"an equivalent for ''shi'' 筮, a form of divination using achilea"
#"a living human being, possibly the name of a person, tribe, place, or territory"
The inscriptions about this living ''wu'', which is later identified as "shaman", reveal six characteristics:&lt;blockquote&gt;
#whether the ''wu'' is a man or a woman is not known;
#it could be either the name for a function or the name of a people (or an individual) coming from a definite territory or nation;
#the wu seems to have been in charge of some divinations, (in one instance, divination is linked to a sacrifice of appeasement);
#the wu is seen as offering a sacrifice of appeasement but the inscription and the fact that this kind of sacrifice was offered by other persons (the king included) suggests that the ''wu'' was not the person of choice to conduct all the sacrifices of appeasement;
#there is only one inscription where a direct link between the king and the ''wu'' appears. Nevertheless, the nature of the link is not known, because the status of the ''wu'' does not appear clearly;
#he follows (being brought, presumably, to Shang territory or court) the orders of other people; he is perhaps offered to the Shang as a tribute. (Boileau 2002:355) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the ''Wu'' spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related.

===''Wu'' in Zhou received texts===
Chinese ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" occurs over 300 times in the [[Chinese classics]], which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of ''wu''-shamans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;men and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of spirits. (De Groot 1910 6:1212) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A single text can describe many roles for ''wu''-shamans. For instance, the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' idealizes their origins in a [[Golden Age]]. It contains a story about [[King Zhao of Chu|King Zhao]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the ''Shujing'' that the sage ruler [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] "commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth". He asks his minister to explain and is told.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of such powers were, if men, called ''xi'' (shamans), and, if women, ''wu'' (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their offerings. There were no natural calamities.
:In the degenerate time of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Shaohao]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (traditionally put at the twenty-sixth century B.C.), however, the Nine Li threw virtue into disorder. Men and spirits became intermingled, with each household indiscriminately performing for itself the religious observances which had hitherto been conducted by the shamans. As a consequence, men lost their reverence for the spirits, the spirits violated the rules of men, and natural calamities arose. Hence the successor of [Shaohao], &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Zhuanxu]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;..., charged &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Chong&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Governor of the South, to handle the affairs of heaven in order to determine the proper place of the spirits, and Li, Governor of Fire, to handle the affairs of Earth, in order to determine the proper place of men. And such is what is meant by cutting the communication between Heaven and Earth. (tr. Bodde 1961:390-391) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as healers====
The belief that [[demonic possession]] caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese medicine]] historically changed from ''wu'' 巫 "spirit-mediums; shamans" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to ''yi'' 毉 or 醫 "doctors; physicians" who used herbal medicine, [[moxibustion]], and [[acupuncture]].

As mentioned above, ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" was depicted in the ancient 毉 variant character for ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor". This archaic ''yi'' 毉, writes Carr (1992:117), "ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with (矢 'arrows' in) a 医 'quiver', a 殳 'hand holding a lance', and a ''wu'' 巫 'shaman'." Unschuld believes this 毉 character depicts the type of ''wu'' practitioner described in the ''Liji''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. (1985:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Replacing the exorcistical 巫 "shaman" in 毉 with medicinal 酒 "wine" in ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor" signified, writes Schiffeler (1976:27), "the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the ''wu'', but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the "priest-physicians," who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients."
[[File:iching-hexagram-32.svg|thumb|Hexagram 32, ''Heng'' 恆]]
''Wu'' and ''yi'' are compounded in the word ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors", translated "exorcising physician" (De Groot 1910), "sorcerer-physician" (Schiffeler 1976), or "physician-shaman" (Mainfort 2004). Confucius quotes a "Southern Saying" that a good ''wuyi'' must have ''heng'' [[Wikt:恆|恆]] "constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., ''Yijing'' [[I Ching hexagram 32#Hexagram 32|Hexagram 32]])". The (ca. 5th century BCE) ''[[Lunyu]]'' "Confucian Analects" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" give different versions of the Southern Saying.

First, the ''Lunyu'' quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; if you do not stabilize an act of ''te'' 德, you will get evil by it (instead of good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the omens. (13/22, tr. Waley 1938:77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Confucius refers to a ''Yijing'' line interpretation of the Heng "Duration" Hexagram (tr. Wilhelm 1967:127-9): "Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace." In Waley's earlier article about the ''Yijing'', he translated "If you do not stabilize your "virtue," Disgrace will overtake you", and quoted the ''Lunyu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes ''heng'' to make even a soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your virtue, disgrace will overtake you'." Confucius adds 不占而已矣, which has completely baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to get an omen,' one must also ''heng'' 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [''de''] in the moral sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! (1933:136-137)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the ''Liji'' quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that "A man without constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks." This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It is said in the ''Book of Poetry'' (II, v, ode 1, 3) "Our tortoise-shells are wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans." The Charge to [Yue] says ([''Shujing''], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), "Dignities should not be conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue." 'It is said in the [''Yijing''], "When one does not continuously maintain his virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a husband evil'." (55, tr. Legge 1885 2:363-364) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Liji'' version makes five changes from the ''Lunyu'' (Carr 1992:121-122). (1) It writes ''bushi'' 卜筮 "diviner" instead of ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor", compounding ''bu'' "divine by bone or shell, [[scapulimancy]] or [[plastromancy]]" and ''shi'' (also with "shaman") "divine by milfoil stalks, [[cleromancy]] or sortilege". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark "well said!"; he describes the southern proverb as "probably a saying handed down from antiquity" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The ''Liji'' correctly quotes the ''Shijing'' (195, tr. Karlgren 1950:142) criticizing royal diviners: "Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans." (4) It quotes the "Charge to Yue" 說命 (traditionally attributed to Shang king [[Wu Ding]]) differently from the fabricated ''Guwen'' "[[Old Texts]]" ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of History" chapter with this name.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. … Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (17, tr. Legge 1865:256-8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(5) It cites an additional ''Yijing'' Hexagram 32 line (tr. Wilhelm 1967:129) that gender determines the auspiciousness of ''heng''. "Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man."

The mytho-geography ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' "Classic of Mountains and Seas" associates ''wu''-shamans with medicinal herbs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;East of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off decay. (tr. Birrell 2000:141) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be found. (tr. Birrell 2000:174) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Shaman Whole" translates [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 below.

Boileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning healing, a comparison of the ''wu'' and the Siberian shaman shows a big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the ''wu'' does not seem to result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil spirit. (2002:361) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as rainmakers====
''Wu'' anciently served as intermediaries with [[nature spirit]]s believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a [[drought]], ''wu''-shamans would perform the ''yu'' [[Wikt:雩|雩]] "sacrificial [[rain dance]] ceremony". If that failed, both ''wu'' and ''wang'' [[Wikt:尪|尪]] "cripple; lame person; emaciated person" engaged in "ritual exposure" (Schafer 1951) [[rainmaking]] techniques based upon [[homeopathic]] or [[sympathetic magic]]. As Unschuld (1985:33-34) explains, "Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain." These ''wu'' and ''wang'' procedures were called ''pu'' [[Wikt:曝|曝]]/[[Wikt:暴|暴]] "expose to open air/sun", ''fen'' [[Wikt:焚|焚]] "burn; set on fire", and ''pulu'' [[Wikt:暴露|暴露]] "reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun".

For the year 639 BCE, the ''Chunqiu'' records, "In summer, there was a great drought" in [[State of Lu|Lu]], and the ''Zuozhuan'' notes a discussion about ''fen wu wang'' 焚巫尪:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The duke (Xi) wanted to burn a ''wu'' and a cripple at the stake. [[Zang Wenzhong]] 臧文仲 said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be ''wu'' and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at all? If they (the cripple and the ''wu'') could produce drought, burning them would augment very much (the disaster). (tr. Boileau 2002:363, cf. Legge 1872:180) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The duke followed this advice, and subsequently "scarcity was not very great".

The ''Liji'' uses the words ''puwang'' 暴尪 and ''puwu'' 暴巫 to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu 穆公 of Lu.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun a ''wu'' and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (tr. Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators interpret the ''wu'' as a female shaman and the ''wang'' as a male cripple.

De Groot connects the ''Zuozhuan'' and ''Liji'' stories about ritually burning ''wu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;These two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' ''wang'' were non-descript individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the ''wu''; perhaps they were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to possession. (1910 6:1194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as oneiromancers====
[[Oneiromancy]] or [[dream interpretation]] was one type of divination performed by ''wu'' 巫. The ''Zuozhuan'' records two stories about ''wu'' interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers.

First, in 581 BCE the lord of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], who had slain two officers from the [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] (趙) family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed ''wu'' "shaman" from Sangtian 桑田 and a ''yi'' "doctor" named Huan 緩 from [[Qin (state)|Qin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: "You have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to the High God in consequence." It then broke the great gate (of the palace), advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he had dreamt. "What will be the issue?" asked the duke. "You will not taste the new wheat," she replied. &lt;br&gt;
After this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two boys, who said, "That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?" Then one of them said: "If we take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?" When the physician arrived, he said, "Nothing can be done for this disease. Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be reached. Nothing can be done for it." The duke said, "He is a skilful physician", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin].&lt;br&gt;
In the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive with him. (tr. Legge 1872:374, note "witch" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators have attempted to explain why the ''wu'' merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. Boileau (2002:368) suggests the ''wu'' was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack.

Second, in 552 BCE a ''wu'' named Gao 皋 both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, when the duke struck him with a [''[[Dagger-axe|ge]]''] on his head, which fell down before him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had had the same dream, said to him: "Your death is to happen about this time; but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]". Xianzi accepted this interpretation. (tr. Legge 1872:478, note "wizard" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boileau questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;why wasn't the ''wu'' asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that the ''wu'' was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in a kind of deal, or is it simply that the ''wu'' was aware of two different matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to these two stories, ''wu'' were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a ''Zhuangzi'' story about the ''shenwu'' 神巫 "[[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirit/god]] shaman" Jixian 季咸 from [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. (tr. Watson 1968:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"As soothsayers." writes de Groot (1910 6:1195), "the ''wu'' in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance."

====Wu-shamans as officials====
Sinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of ''wu'' 巫 in ancient China. Some scholars (e.g., Eliade 1964 and Chang 1983) believe Chinese ''wu'' used "techniques of ecstasy" like shamans elsewhere; others (e.g., Keightley 1983) believe ''wu'' were "ritual bureaucrats" or "moral metaphysicians" who did not engage in shamanistic practices.

[[Chen Mengjia]] wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were ''wu''-shamans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that "the king made the prognostication that …," pertaining to weather, the border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (1936:535, tr. Chang 1983:46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by [[Kwang-chih Chang]] who cited the ''Guoyu'' story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above).
&lt;blockquote&gt;This myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of shamanism in ancient Chinese politics. Heaven is where all the wisdom of human affairs lies. … Access to that wisdom was, of course, requisite for political authority. In the past, ''everybody'' had had that access through the shamans. Since heaven had been severed from earth, only those who controlled that access had the wisdom – hence the authority – to rule. Shamans, therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. (1983:45) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some modern scholars disagree. For instance, Boileau (2002:350) calls Chen's hypothesis "somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history" and says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of the relationship between ''wu'' and ''wang'' [king], Chen Mengjia did not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the ''wu'' was not involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the ''wu'' was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head ''wu'' was influenced by [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s theories about the origin of political power: for Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. (2002:351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shujing'' "Classic of History" lists [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 and Wu Xian 巫賢 as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The [[Duke of Zhou]] tells Prince [[Shao]] 召 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have heard that of ancient time, when [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] had received the favoring decree, he had with him [[Yi Yin]], making his virtue like that of great Heaven. [[Tai Jia]], again, had Bao Heng. [[Tai Wu]] had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [巫咸] Wu Xian, who regulated the royal house; [[Zu Yi]] had [巫賢] Wu Xian. [[Wu Ding]] had Gan Pan. These ministers carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it extended over many years. (tr. Legge 1865:206, n.b., names standardized to pinyin) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Boileau,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the divination using  [''shi'' 筮] achilea. He was apparently made a high god in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] 秦 during the Warring States period. The Tang subcommentary interprets the character ''wu'' of Wu Xian father and son as being a [[cognomen]], the name of the clan from which the two Xian came. It is possible that in fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from the same eponymous territory ''wu''. Perhaps, later, the name (''wu'' 巫) of these two ministers has been confused with the character ''wu'' (巫) as employed in other received texts. (2002:358) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wu''-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of ''wugu'' 巫蠱 (with [[Gu (poison)|''gu'']] "venom-based poison") "sorcery; casting harmful spells". In 130 BCE, [[Empress Chen Jiao]] was convicted of using shamans from [[State of Yue|Yue]] to conduct ''wugu'' magic. She "was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed" (tr. Loewe 1970:169), their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince [[Liu Ju]] involved accusations of practicing ''wugu'', and subsequently "no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836).

Ever since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (de Groot 1910:1233-42, Waley 1955:11-12). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as [[sexism]]. Schafer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile to [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|women in government]], and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The "licentiousness" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken the "respectable" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the ''Chou li'', apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying the principle ''yin'', were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the element ''yang'', were naturally hostile to them. (1951:158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Accepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., ''wu'' 巫 "shamaness" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "shaman"), Kagan believes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the male Confucian orthodoxy to [[Women in ancient and imperial China|strip women of their public and sacred powers]] and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, prestige, and status. (1980:3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Unschuld (1980:125-128) refers to a "Confucian medicine" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons).

The ''Zhouli'' provides detailed information about the roles of ''wu''-shamans. It lists (Falkenhausen 1995:282), "Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (''Liguan'' 禮官, or Ministry of Spring, ''Chun guan'' 春官)." This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu 司巫 "Manager/Director of Shamans", Nanwu 男巫 "Male Shamans", and ''Nüwu'' 女巫 "Female Shamans".

The managerial Siwu, who was of [[Chinese nobility#Fengjian and Zongfa of the Zhou Dynasty|''Shi'']] 士 "Gentleman; Yeoman" feudal rank, yet was not a ''wu'', supervised "the many ''wu''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (''yu'' 雩). When the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (''wuheng'' 巫恆). At official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs]. In all official sacrificial services, they guard the place where the offerings are buried. In all funerary services, they are in charge of the rituals by which the Spirit Mediums make [the spirits] descend (''jiang'' 降). (tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:285, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189-1190) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Nanwu and Nüwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the ''si'' 祀 and ''yan'' 衍 Sacrifices to the Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] without a fixed direction and without counting the number. In the spring, they make proclamations and issue bans so as to remove sickness and disease. When the king offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede him. &lt;br&gt;
The Female Mediums are in charge of anointing and ablutions at the exorcisms that are held at regular times throughout the year. When there is a drought or scorching heat, they dance in the rain-making ritual (''yu''). When the queen offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede her. In all great calamities of the state, they pray, singing and wailing. (26, tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:290, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Falkenhausen concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and distress. In case of droughts and calamities, they directly address the supernatural powers of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, they are experts in dealing with frightful, dangerous ghosts (the ghosts of the defunct at the time of the funeral, the evil spirits at the exorcism, and the spirits of disease) and harmful substances (unburied dead bodies during visits of condolence and all manner of impure things at the lustration festival). (1995:293)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chu Ci''===
{{Main|Chu Ci}}
The poetry anthology ''Chu Ci'', especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]].(1985[2011]:''passim'') Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as ''[[Heavenly Questions|Tianwen]]'' (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (''Nine Songs'') as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from ''[[Li Sao]]'' through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by [[Liu An]], the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The [[List of Chu Ci contents|''Chu Ci'' contents]] have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-[[Han dynasty]] group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, "[[Bu Ju]]" and "[[Yu Fu]]") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be "functional, explicitly shamanistic": ''[[Jiu Ge]]'', ''Tian Wen'', and the two shamanic summons for the soul, "[[The Great Summons]]" and "[[Summons of the Soul]]".(1985[2011]:38) Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that "shamanism, if there is any" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey.

====Background====
The mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the [[oracle bone|shell and bone]] oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the [[Shang dynasty]] and with the literary works of the Western [[Zhou dynasty]], which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the [[Han dynasty]] under the title ''[[Chu Ci]]'', literally meaning something like "the literary material of Chu".(Hawkes:16-17 and 28-29) Despite the tendency of Confucian-oriented  government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of [[Qu Yuan]] and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity.(Hawkes:19-20) Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the ''Chu Ci'', and in Chinese mythology more generally.(Hawkes:42-47)

====''Li Sao'', ''Yuan You'', and ''Jiu Bian''====
{{Main|Li Sao|Yuan You|Jiu Bian}}
The signature poem of the ''Chu Ci'' is the poem ''[[Li Sao]]''. By China's "first poet", [[Qu Yuan]], a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. "[[Yuan You]]", literally "The Far-off Journey" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does ''[[Jiu Bian]]'', as part of its climactic ending. In the ''Li Sao'', two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen (靈氛) and Wu Xian (巫咸).(Hawkes:45, note 9) This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

====Questioning Heaven====
{{Main|Heavenly Questions}}
The ''[[Heavenly Questions]]'' (literally "Questioning Heaven") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history.

====''Jiu Ge''====
{{Main|Jiu Ge}}
The ''Jiu Ge'' may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the [[Yangzi River]] basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations.

====Summoning the soul====
{{Further|Hun and po}}
Summoning the soul (''hun'') of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 ''Chu Ci'' pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process.

====Individual wu shaman====
{{Main|List of wu shaman}} 
Various individual wu shaman are alluded to in the ''Chu Ci''. In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian,(Hawkes:70 and 84-86) which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as "Shaman Ancestors". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received ''Chu Ci'' text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''Zhao Hun''/''Summons for the Soul''. He also appears in ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' together with Wu Peng (巫彭): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231)

==Modern wu==
[[File:Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen, in July 1994 (Photo by Richard Noll).jpg|thumb|The [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] shaman Chuonnasuan in July 1994.]]
The ancient Chinese traditions of ''wu''-shamans continue in the contemporary cultures of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Popular practices include clairvoyance, fortune telling, exorcism, invocation, and prayer.

Scholars have studied many aspects of modern ''wu''. De Groot (1910 6:1243-1268) provided descriptions and pictures of hereditary shamans in [[Fujian]], called ''saigong'' (pinyin ''shigong'') 師公. Paper (1999) analyzed ''tongji'' mediumistic activities in the Taiwanese village of Bao'an 保安. Noll (2004) documented Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), the last shaman of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] in northeast China.

Jordan Paper summarizes the present-day shaman's religious significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediums, frequently associated with local temples … are ubiquitous aspects of popular Chinese religion. They are (or at least were into the mid-twentieth century) common from far north in Manchuria to the extreme south of Hainan and Guangtung, and from the eastern island of Taiwan to Tibet in China's far west. (1995:117-8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
