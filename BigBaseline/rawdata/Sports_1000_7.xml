Sport became increasingly popular in [[England]] and [[Ireland]] through the 17th century and there are several references to [[cricket]] and [[horse racing]], while [[bare-knuckle boxing]] was revived. The interest of gamblers in these sports gave rise to [[Professional sports|professionalism]]. The first known attempts to organise [[football]] took place in Ireland.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1681 — The ancient sport of [[Boxing|pugilism]] resurfaced in England during the late 17th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]], also known as [[prizefighting]]; the first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight was published in the ''London Protestant Mercury''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==[[Chess]]==
* Having been firmly established in Spain and Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries, chess became increasingly fashionable in France which, by the end of the 17th century, was the main centre of European chess.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Cotswold Games]]==
* [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]]'s [[Cotswold Games|Olimpick Games]] held in the [[Cotswolds]] from c.1604 to 1612.&lt;ref name=BOA&gt;{{citation |title=400 Years of Olimpick Passion |url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |publisher=Robert Dover's Games Society |accessdate=4 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606045814/http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=853 |archive-date=2010-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{citation |last=Williams |first=Jean |title=The Curious Mystery of the Cotswold 'Olimpick' Games: Did Shakespeare Know Dover ... and Does it Matter? |journal=Sport in History |doi=10.1080/17460260902872602 |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=150–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* c.1611 — the world's earliest known organised cricket match was played at [[Chevening, Kent]] between teams styled [[Weald and Upland cricket team|Weald and Upland]] and [[Chalkhill cricket team|Chalkhill]].&lt;ref name=DU4&gt;Underdown, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 1611 to 1660 — numerous court cases concerning cricket.&lt;ref name=LTL17C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |title=From Lads to Lord's – 17th century |last=Leach |first=John |publisher=Stumpsite |date=2007 |accessdate=17 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153250/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html |archivedate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 September 1624 — death of [[Jasper Vinall]] (born c. 1590), the first cricketer known to die as a result of an injury received when playing the game.&lt;ref name=TJM&gt;McCann, pp. xxxiii–xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Village cricket]] thrived in the middle period of the 17th century, but there is no evidence of teams of county strength being formed at this time.&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt;
* c.1660 — in the wake of the [[English Restoration]], the popularity of cricket as a gambling sport encouraged investment and patronage; the introduction of professional players and the formation of teams representative of multiple parishes, possibly whole counties, mark the beginning of an evolution from the level of village cricket towards a major standard.&lt;ref name=HSA23&gt;Altham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W10&gt;Webber, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LTL17C/&gt; 
* 1695 — Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] on the Act's expiry in 1696; it is from this time that matters concerning cricket and other sports could be reported in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/pp428-435 |title=Charles II, 1662: An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Bookes and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses |publisher=British History Online |work=Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5 |date=1628–80 |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 7 July 1697 — the ''Foreign Post'' reported a "A Great Match in Sussex" played for fifty guineas, the earliest known record of a top-class match.&lt;ref name=FL18C1&gt;Buckley, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TJM3&gt;McCann, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Curling]]==
'''Events'''

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* 1602 — [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] described the game of "hurling to goals" being played in eastern [[Cornwall]] in his "Survey of Cornwall". The game had the earliest described rules requiring equal numbers, no playing of the ball on the ground, and banning the forward pass, with similarities to the modern game of [[Rugby football]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
'''Ireland'''
* 17th century — football games grew in popularity and were widely played under the patronage of the gentry; games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants and attracting wagers with purses of up to 100 guineas.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1670 — the earliest record of a recognised precursor to modern football dates from a match in [[County Meath]] in which catching and kicking the ball were permitted.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1695 — "foot-ball" is banned by the severe ''Sunday Observance Act'', imposing a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports on the Sabbath but it proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Golf]]==
'''Events'''
* 1603 — [[James VI of Scotland]] appointed Edinburgh bowmaker William Mayne as royal club-maker for his lifetime.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''Events'''
* 1605 — [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] became known as the home of horse racing in England after its discovery by [[James I of England|James I]] while out [[falconry|hawking]] or riding; the region has a long association with horses going back to the time of [[Boadicea]] and the [[Iceni]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1634 — by this time, spring and autumn race meetings had been introduced at Newmarket and the first Gold Cup event was held in 1634.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1654 — all horse racing banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and many horses requisitioned by the state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1664 — following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], racing flourished and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] instituted the [[Newmarket Town Plate]], writing the rules himself:{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
::"Articles ordered by His Majestie to be observed by all persons that put in horses to ride for the Plate, the new round heat at Newmarket set out on the first day of October, 1664, in the 16th year of our Sovereign Lord King Charles II, which Plate is to be rid for yearly, the second Thursday in October for ever".

==[[Lacrosse]]==
'''Events'''
* 15th–19th century — [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] played lacrosse to resolve conflicts, heal the sick, give thanks to the Creator and train for war in modern-day Canada and the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* 1636 — [[Jean de Brébeuf]], a French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary]], watched a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] game of lacrosse in what is now [[Ontario]], and he noticed that the sticks resemble a [[bishop]]'s [[crosier]] or "la crosse" in [[French language|French]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The '''1972 Olympics Black Power Salute''' was a political protest by two US Olympic runners [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] and [[Wayne Collett]] during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] at the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]].  This event is sometimes referred to as "The Forgotten Protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2011/02/01/vince-matthews-and-wayne-collette-1972-the-forgotten-protest/|title=Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett 1972 – The Forgotten Protest?|author=Jimson Lee|work=SpeedEndurance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event came four years after the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/24/sport/olympics-norman-black-power/|title=The third man: The forgotten Black Power hero|author=James Montague, CNN|date=24 April 2012|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the games==
Matthews was a 1968 Olympian who had retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/vince-matthews-1.html|title=Vince Matthews|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was frustrated by problems that included having to pay his own travel to the US Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartmann | first=D. | title=Race, Culture, and the Revolt of the Black Athlete: The 1968 Olympic Protests and Their Aftermath | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-226-31855-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNvIe2JE0vIC&amp;pg=PA241 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protest==
Both runners refused to stand for the US National Anthem.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schiller | first=K. | last2=Young | first2=C. | title=The 1972 Munich Olympics and the Making of Modern Germany | publisher=University of California Press | series=Weimar and now | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxEQEqnXdRAC&amp;pg=PT134 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently stroked their beards, and twirled their medals as they left the stadium.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; The crowd booed both runners for their display.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/17/local/la-me-wayne-collett18-2010mar18|title=Wayne Collett dies at 60; UCLA sprinter won silver medal at '72 Olympics|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reaction==
The [[Associated Press]] noted that the casual behavior of Matthews and Collett during the playing of the anthem as "disrespectful," and described the conduct as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Collett, bare-footed, leaped from the No. 2 tier to the No. 1 stand beside his teammate.  They stood sideways to the flag, twirling their medals, with Matthews stroking his chin. Their shoulders slumped, neither stood erect nor looked at the flag. ... As whistles and catcalls continued, Collett raised a clenched fist to the crowd before entering the portal of the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milburn, Matthews Win Gold, But U.S. Trails|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gpwcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mWYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5359,2754393&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Markus reported in the Chicago Tribune on September 9, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/229/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Matthews] was angry at Coach Bill Bowerman-as most of the U.S. trackmen seem to be-because Bowerman had hinted he would like to remove him from the place he had earned in the 400-meter field. He was angry that he had been forced to train on his own in unsuitable facilities, had to travel 4 or 5 times from N.Y. to the west coast in order to get any kind of competition, and had been put down by some of the press as a drag on America's hopes for a 400-meter sweep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chicago Tribune further reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/227/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Matthews said his and Collett's actions were directed at the U.S. coaching staff, not the flag or the National Anthem. "We were just mad about a lot of things. We didn't think it would blow up like this. We were asked to apologize. I'm not really sorry for what I did. I'm sorry for the way people took it [hoots and whistles from the stands when the anthem finished]. What I tried to get across to the Olympic Committee was if it was pre-meditated I could have done something better than that. It was just something that happened. We didn't realize the implications to the people in the stands."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview after the medal ceremony with the [[American Broadcasting Company]], Collett said the [[national anthem]] meant nothing to him.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;{{cite news|author=Chuck Johnson|title=Matthews, Collett Barred for Conduct on Victory Stand|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cMAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7196,4127118&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He explained that he had felt unable to honor the anthem, because of the struggle faced by [[African American]]s at the time: "I couldn't stand there and sing the words because I don't believe they're true. I wish they were. I believe we have the potential to have a beautiful country, but I don't think we do." The pair were banned from future Olympic competition by the IOC; since [[John Smith (sprinter)|John Smith]] had pulled a hamstring 80 meters into the final while leading and had been ruled unfit to run, the USA were now unable to field a team in the [[4 × 400 metres relay|4 × 400 m relay]] and were forced to scratch from the event.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

===Athlete statements===
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't acting any differently than I usually do, but we were like goldfish in a fishbowl, in front of all those people. If they wanted me to stand at attention, I could've probably done that, but it wouldn't be me, and I was led to believe that the Olympics was for the athlete. We consider ourselves athletes, not politicians, or marching bands. Our athletic competition was over, and we were both happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/merron/030205.html|title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Violating the Olympic spirit|work=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After the games==
Matthews was banned from all future Olympic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+banned&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=njf4IVrOwi&amp;sig=JH18ql10zlU9ayOguLiIDL6LvMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xF8uVY3-KsuKyATe4YGACA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20banned&amp;f=false%7ctitle=Jet%7cwork=google.com|title=Jet|work=google.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both runners in fact received a lifelong ban from the IOC and the USOC.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; This banning likely cost the US medals in the 4x400.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; Both runners were eventually elected to the Black Olympian Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KdbR4eqgfEC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+Wayne+Collett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiCNVyOHE4&amp;sig=X8bd-DGcrE-KxhtW7acoiCA9AME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmIuVYuuEouoyQSArYHIAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20Wayne%20Collett&amp;f=false|title=Black Enterprise|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] stated the actions of Matthews and Collett made for  a "disgusting display."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/wayne-collett-athlete-who-staged-a-black-power-protest-at-the-1972-olympic-games-1956018.html|title=Wayne Collett: Athlete who staged a Black Power protest at the 1972 Olympic Games|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This display by the athletes would be overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Collett went on to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 2011, Matthews was elected to the USATF Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/halloffame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=249|title=USATF - Hall of Fame|work=usatf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From March to May 1998, a terror plot against the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France was uncovered by European law enforcement.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=European Police Raids Target World Cup Terrorist Threat|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/27/sports/sp-53951|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=27 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Europe Overview|journal=Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1998|url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_98/europe.htm|publisher=[[Bureau of Counterterrorism|Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism]] (United States Department of State)|date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 people were arrested in seven countries as a result of the plot.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|authorlink=Simon Kuper|title=Is football facing a new age of stadium terrorism after Paris attacks?|url=http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/74/blog/post/2715900/paris-attacks-and-a-new-age-of-stadium-terrorism|work=ESPN FC|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by the Algerian [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) and backed by [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]], the plot is thought to have targeted the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Group G#England vs Tunisia|England–Tunisia match]] on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the [[Stade Vélodrome]] in [[Marseille]] in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in [[Paris]] hosting the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]], and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Poitiers]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

==Raids and arrests==
The original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian [[Farid Melouk]], who had previously been sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the [[1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=World News Briefs; Belgians Arrest Suspect In Paris Bombings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/world/world-news-briefs-belgians-arrest-suspect-in-paris-bombings.html|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bruxelles : échec au réseau du GIA|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/1998/03/06/186734-bruxelles-echec-au-reseau-du-gia.html|work=La Dépêche du Midi|date=6 March 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anschläge bei Fußball-WM?|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7838193.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=16 March 1998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Silhouette|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/1998-11-10/Silhouette-_NP_-1998-11-10-462539|work=La Croix|date=10 November 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Le repaire belge du terrorisme|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/le-repaire-belge-du-terrorisme-51b874c6e4b0de6db9a638e6|work=La Libre Belgique|date=14 September 2001|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into [[Belgium]], where he was found to be in contact with [[Ahmed Zaoui]] and a GIA-linked [[Brussels]] mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, fifty police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti-terrorism raids in Belgium.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"/&gt; Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov rifle]], several handguns and thousands worth of [[United States dollar|US dollars]] in cash.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Brynjar|last1=Lia|authorlink1=Brynjar Lia|first2=Åshild|last2=Kjøk|date=8 August 2001|title=Islamist Insurgencies, Diasporic Support Networks, and their Host States: The Case of the Algerian GIA in Europe 1993–2000|url=https://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/01-03789.pdf|publisher=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] (FFI)|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

The March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt; Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chronology: The Plots|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/front/special/cron.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 May, nearly 100 people were detained in coordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander [[Hassan Hattab]] were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, [[Lyon]] and [[Corsica]]; around 25 were arrested and charged or deported.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; French Interior Minister [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]] said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; According to counter-terrorism magistrate [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

==Plot and aftermath==
The plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England-Tunisia match on 15 June.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters [[David Beckham]] and [[Michael Owen]]), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Harris|title=England terrorist plot revealed|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/683732/england-football-team-escaped-terrorist-attack-at-1998-world-cup|work=ESPN FC|date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Laurent|last=Dubois|year=2010|title=Soccer Empire: The World Cup and the Future of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tyBmBcbZIMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PT181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=University of California Press|page=181|isbn=9780520259287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; The attacks would be followed by another group of terrorists who would hijack an aircraft and crash it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a [[nuclear meltdown]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

The details or even existence of the plot was kept secret from managers, players and the media, but was known to security including [[The Football Association|FA]] staff.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; In 2009, England manager in 1998 [[Glenn Hoddle]] revealed that he had only been informed of the plot "years later", while FA Director of Communications during 1998 [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by FA Head of Security Brian Hayes.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseilles, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt;

Although organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-first1=Nicholas John|editor-last1=Cull|editor-first2=David Holbrook|editor-last2=Culbert|editor-first3=David|editor-last3=Welch|first=Nicholas J.|last=Cull|year=2003|title=Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present|chapter=Osama bin Laden|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byzv7rf6gL8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=9781576078204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to bin Laden biographer [[Yossef Bodansky]], the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for "dormant terrorist networks" responsible for the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] being "reactivated". The attacks killed over 200 and wounded more than 4,000.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The World's Game Is Not Just A Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/magazine/the-world-s-game-is-not-just-a-game.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=26 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A terror plot against the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] was discovered after Dutch intelligence intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Gun guard on French soccer stars|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/euro2000/news/20000620frathreat.html|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=20 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt; One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served 6 years after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt;

The night before the first ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the [[Stade de France]]. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=International Football: Seventeen held as Algerian fans invade pitch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3014255/International-Football-Seventeen-held-as-Algerian-fans-invade-pitch.html|work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match itself became marred with controversy, and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes left playing after Algerian fans stormed the field.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

The '''2009 Malmö Davis Cup riots''' were anti-[[Israel]] riots in the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] against a [[Davis Cup]] tennis match [[2009 Davis Cup World Group#Sweden vs. Israel|between Sweden and Israel]] on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Israel protest staged at Sweden tennis match|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-davis-protests-idUSTRE5261R220090307|publisher=Reuters|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-Israel protest turns violent|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2009/03/200937141836935467.html|work=Al Jazeera|date=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In February, the tennis match had been decided by Malmö's [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|red-green]] city coalition to be closed to the public, a decision that was heavily criticised by the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF).&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweden-Israel Davis Cup to go ahead without public|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/sports/24iht-tennisdavis24.20403874.html|work=The New York Times|date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Owen|last=Gibson|title=Fans banned from Israel's Davis cup tie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/28/tennis-israel-gaza-davis-cup|work=The Guardian|date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayor of Malmö, [[Ilmar Reepalu]] personally said he thought the game should not be played at all, and the decision was thus considered to be more politically motivated than out of security concerns.&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Davis Cup Double Fault: Israel-Sweden Fan Lockout Stirs Controversy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/davis-cup-double-fault-israel-sweden-fan-lockout-stirs-controversy-a-611738.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==
In anticipation of protests around 1,000 police officers sanctioned off a large area around the Baltic Hall tennis stadium to keep protesters and rioters away.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; A reported 170 truck loads of pavement stones were transported out of the area before the protests, and three schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ole|last=Rothenborg|title=Stenhögar kan stoppa polisinsatsen|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/stenhogar-kan-stoppa-polisinsatsen/|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=4 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for the first time in history, riot vehicles were brought in from [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jacob|last=Lund|title=Frykter sammenstøt i Sverige|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/sverige/frykter-sammenstoet-i-sverige/a/551211/|work=Verdens Gang|date=7 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest and riots led to accusations of [[antisemitism]] in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sverige anklagas för antisemitism|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/malmo/sverige-anklagas-for-antisemitism/|publisher=Sydsvenskan/TT|date=9 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Anna|last=Ekström|title="Politiker måste agera mot antisemitism"|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/opinion/aktuella-fragor/politiker-maste-agera-mot-antisemitism/|publisher=Sydsvenskan|date=14 March 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish history professor [[Kristian Gerner]] described the situation as "the worst crisis for Jews in Sweden since the Second World War."&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

===Sports management educational programmes===
AISTS provides sports management graduate programs by the Master of Advanced Studies in Sport Administration and Technology (MAS)

====Master of Advanced Studies in Sport Administration and Technology (MAS) ====
The AISTS MAS (Master of Advanced Studies) in Sports Administration and Technology is a sports management graduate program in sports management.  Training is offered in Sports Management &amp; Economics, Technology, Law, Sociology, and sports Medicine.  A multidisciplinary master's degree co-signed by the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne]], the University of Geneva and the [[University of Lausanne]]. Every year, it attracts graduate students and professionals from all continents (85% of the students are not Swiss). '''MAS - [http://aists.org Master of Advanced Studies in Sports Administration and Technology]'''

===Sports management program seminars===

====Sustainable Sport and Event Open Module ====
Over two days, the Sustainable Sport &amp; Events Learning Module provides an understanding of the current challenges and opportunities of sustainability in sport. This understanding will be reinforced through a number of case studies, which offer concrete examples of what leading sports organisations, such as FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Automobile Federation are achieving in this area. Participants will also gain insight into the best practices adopted by the American major leagues such as the NFL, NBA and MLB. Throughout both days, group work and discussions will challenge the existing ideas of sustainability in sport, with a particular focus on the business case for sustainability while simultaneously addressing the demands of multiple stakeholders.

====SEMOS (Sport Event Management and Organisation Seminar)====
The AISTS SEMOS module offers an overview of the key tasks that sports managers need to successfully plan, communicate and operate when organising sport events, providing a 360° view and behind the scenes look at the mechanics of sport events.  Bringing together leaders of International Sport Federations and other experts of the AISTS network, including the International Olympic Committee and sport event organisers, AISTS SEMOS is both pertinent and practical, and recognises the increased expectations of spectators, media and sponsors at major events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33475">The '''age requirements in gymnastics''' are established by the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG) and regulate the age at which athletes are allowed to participate in senior-level competitions.

In the latter half of the 20th century, a series of controversies arose with regard to gymnast ages, some of them leading to sanctions by FIG, and paving the way for the age requirements to be raised from 14 to 15 in 1981, and then to 16 in 1997.

==History of age requirements in artistic gymnastics==
{{See also|Gymnastics all-around champions by age}}

Prior to [[1981 in sports|1981]], the minimum required age to compete in senior events sanctioned by the FIG (including the [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]) was 14.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1980 |title=Within the International Federations |journal=Olympic Review |issue=155 |pages=520 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |accessdate=2006-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524213018/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied [[ballet]] for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast [[Ágnes Keleti]] won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. [[Larisa Latynina]], the first great [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 [[World Gymnastics Championships|World Champion]] while pregnant with her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061027054302/http://www.intlgymnast.com/legends/latynina.html "Legends: Larissa Latynina"] ''International Gymnast,'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] gymnast [[Věra Čáslavská]], who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="heroine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=16525|title=Vera Čáslavská: The heroine of Mexico|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2008-07-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080703043503/http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?par_i_id=16525| archivedate= 3 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s — [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]] was sixteen at her first Olympics in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] — they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased.

By the late 1970s, Federations occasionally requested permission to allow slightly underage athletes to compete as seniors. One such example is that of Canadian gymnast [[Karen Kelsall]], who legally competed in the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] at the age of 13. At the time, gymnasts had to turn 14 by the start of the Games to be eligible. Kelsall, with her December 1962 birthday, was five months shy of the requirement but was turning 14 within the Olympic year, and was granted a special exemption by the FIG to compete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/kelsall.shtml Gymnastics Canada biography of Karen Kelsall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603193852/http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/kelsall.shtml |date=2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exemptions were not automatic, however: American gymnast [[Tracee Talavera]], who was named to the [[United States]] team for the 1979 World Championships, was deemed ineligible to compete due to her age of 12½ years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/bios/women/talavera.html List of competitive results and bio at Gymn-Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rift&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/NYT-Ages.html "Rift Over Underage Gymnasts"] Neil Amdur, ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the changing demands of the sport, at the 58th Congress of the FIG, held in July 1980 just before the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics]], the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15. Under this rule, which went into effect in 1981, gymnasts were required to turn at least 15 years of age in the calendar year to compete in senior-level events.&lt;ref name=congress /&gt; This age requirement remained in place until 1997, when it was raised one more year, from 15 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/03mar/nb_gym.htm "Female gymnasts: older—and healthier?"] ''The Physician and Sports Medicine,'' Vol. 23 No. 3, March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fake&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1964264.stm "Romanian gymnasts faked age to compete"] BBC News/Europe, May 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for age restrictions==
Age restrictions were supposedly designed not so much to level the playing field in terms of skill and physical advantages, as to protect child athletes from injury. However, critics dispute the science behind the policy and argue that the answer is to prohibit junior gymnasts from competing in senior competitions.

==Current regulations==
Currently, per the 1997 regulation, gymnasts must be at least 16 years of age, or turning 16 within the calendar year, to compete in senior-level events. For the current Olympic cycle, in order to compete in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympics]], a gymnast must have a birth date before January 1, 2001. There is no maximum age restriction, and some gymnasts compete well into their 20s. The oldest female gymnast currently competing in senior international events is Uzbekistan's [[Oksana Chusovitina]],&lt;ref name="ageless"&gt;{{cite web

===Terminology===
The term '''senior''', in gymnastics, refers to any world-class gymnast who is age-eligible under F.I.G. rules. The term '''junior''' is used to describe any gymnast who competes at a world-class level, but does not meet the F.I.G.'s age minimum. Juniors are judged under the same '''Code of Points''' as the seniors, and often exhibit the same level of difficulty in their routines.

===Legal exceptions===
The one exception to the F.I.G.'s age restrictions until recently applied to the year before the Olympics, when gymnasts who were one year below the required age, but would be the required age in the Olympic year, were allowed to compete as seniors at the World Championships and other FIG meets. For instance, gymnasts born in 1977 were allowed to compete at senior events in 1991, when they were 14 or turning 14 within the calendar year. Within the last Olympic cycle, gymnasts born in 1992 were permitted to compete as seniors in 2007. This was permitted to allow nations to qualify to the Olympics with their best teams, and to give emerging gymnasts some experience in major competition before the Olympics. However, the FIG eliminated this exception as of the 2012 Olympic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2007-12/04/content_6297534.htm "Age limits for gymnasts may be set after 2008"] Xinhua News Service, December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the age requirement technically only applies to meets which are sanctioned and regulated directly by the FIG: the Olympics, the World Championships and the World Cup circuit. Many other meets, such as the European Championships, have separate divisions for juniors. Additionally, some competitions, such as the [[Pan-American Games|Pan Am Games]], the Pacific Rim Championships and the [[All-Africa Games]], have different rules which permit seniors and juniors to compete together. There are also numerous international competitions specifically limited to junior gymnasts, such as the Japan Junior International, Moscow World Stars, the Junior Pan American Championships, and the Youth Olympic Games.

===Verification procedures===
According to official statements from the FIG, "the accepted proof of a gymnast’s eligibility for competition is a valid passport issued by the country of residence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gymnast Age Limitations |url=http://209.20.80.25/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0,10869,5195-191062-208285-45462-288055-news-item,00.html |publisher=NIS FIG Office |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821201538/http://209.20.80.25/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0%2C10869%2C5195-191062-208285-45462-288055-news-item%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This verification process has been criticized by some in the gymnastics community, with the argument that countries can manufacture and submit falsified documents for underage athletes.&lt;ref name=apaug2&gt;{{cite news |first=Nancy |last=Armour |title=More questions about Chinese gymnasts' ages|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i0x9UJBzQoVxo1MCC90C2ihzkH8QD92ARRC84 |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2008-08-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080817032305/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i0x9UJBzQoVxo1MCC90C2ihzkH8QD92ARRC84| archivedate= 17 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/tweddle-the-loser-as-age-doubts-mar-hes-triumph-901736.html|title=Tweddle the loser as age doubts mar He's triumph|publisher=''The Independent''|author=Harris, Nick|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2008-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080819122617/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/tweddle-the-loser-as-age-doubts-mar-hes-triumph-901736.html| archivedate= 19 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, gymnasts involved in age falsification have verified that they did in fact compete under forged passports provided to them by their federations.&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;''The Secrets of a Gymnast.''

Since 2009, gymnasts competing in FIG-sanctioned events at both the senior and junior level have been required to have licenses issued by the Federation. These licenses reportedly verify the competitors' ages based on their passports. However, the licensing does not include any independent verification of submitted passport information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-olygymchina10-2008aug10,0,3941558.story |title=More age monitoring for women's gymnastics |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |author=Pucin, Diane |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815004923/http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-olygymchina10-2008aug10%2C0%2C3941558.story |archivedate=15 August 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from coaches and federations===
The age limit is arguably one of the most contentious rules in gymnastics, and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts and members of the media. While some members of the sport, such as former [[USA Gymnastics]] president Bob Colarossi, have expressed support for the age limit of 16, others, such as coach [[Béla Károlyi]], have heavily criticized it.&lt;ref name=old&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000914/ai_n9976865 "Gymnasts are Old-lympians/Golden Girls going for gold in Sydney"] Paula Parrish, ''Colorado Springs Gazette,'' September 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the age restrictions have pointed out that it has encouraged older gymnasts to remain in the sport. The average age of an international gymnast was 18.10 years in 2005. In contrast, in 1994, before the new age requirements, it was 16.49, and in 1989, gymnasts who had reached the age of 17 were already often considered to be of retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aipsmedia.com/index.php?page=news&amp;cod=830&amp;tp=n "Gymnasts too young? FIG says the rumor is false"] International Sports Press Association, February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/01/opinion/topics-of-the-times-gymnastic-girls-not-women.html "Gymnastic Girls, Not Women"] ''The New York Times'', August 1, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the rule have countered that by barring younger gymnasts from top level meets, they are denying them valuable competitive experience.&lt;ref name=old /&gt; They have also argued that junior gymnasts perform and are scored under the same ''Code of Points'' as the seniors, perform the same skills, and are thus not avoiding the physical impact of training and performing high-level skills. It is also argued that the current ''Code of Points'', with its increased requirements for difficult skills, is more suited to younger and lighter athletes, and puts older athletes at greater risk of injury.&lt;ref name=nytnew&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Issues of Age Seem to Follow Chinese Gymnasts"] Jere Longman, Juliet Macur. ''The New York Times,'' July 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age falsification==&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Age falsification in gymnastics]]" --&gt;
Age falsification is the practice of [[age fabrication|advancing gymnasts' ages]] to make them age-eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top-level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts.&lt;ref name=fake /&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt; Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves have come forward and publicly confirmed and verified the falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Silivas, Alexandra Marinescu, Yang Yun, Lavinia Agache, Olga Mostepanova&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Gogean&lt;/ref&gt; Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led to the discovery of age falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Gwang Suk, Lavinia Agache, Olga Bicherova&lt;/ref&gt;

Gymnasts who have had their ages falsified, and have spoken about their experiences, have indicated that they were not given a choice in the matter.&lt;ref name=secrets /&gt; In a 2002 interview, Romanian gymnast [[Daniela Silivaş]], whose age was advanced two years in the 1980s, noted: "One of the officials of the Federation told me 'Look at the passport, from today you're not 13 years old anymore but 15.' Nobody asked me if I agreed to this, I was just a child. They needed gold medals and everybody who was involved in gymnastics knew about these practices."&lt;ref name=prosport /&gt;

While age falsification has been denied among many gymnastics officials, in recent years some have publicly admitted that the practice has occurred. In reference to the falsifications of the early 1990s and 1980s, the head of the [[Romania]]n Gymnastics Federation, Nicolae Vieru, was quoted in 2002: "Changing the ages was a worldwide practice...we copied this from others."&lt;ref name=fake /&gt; The FIG has publicly stated that they view age falsification as an unacceptable practice. However, there have only been three cases, those of [[Kim Gwang Suk]] in 1993 and [[Dong Fangxiao]] and [[Hong Su Jong]] in 2010, where the FIG has elected to take any action against a gymnastics federation for age falsification.&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name=fangxiao /&gt;

===Reasons for age falsification===
According to many scientific and medical studies, as well as reports from ex-gymnasts, younger gymnasts may have psychological or physical advantages in elite gymnastics competition.

Psychologically, younger gymnasts may be more fearless, and have less visceral appreciation for the potential for injury. They are therefore more likely to perform more dangerous, and more highly scored, routines with confidence and steadiness.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Stefano |title=China gymnast underage, AP alleges |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_583045.html |publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823113905/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_583045.html |archivedate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Psychologically, I think they worry less,” former Olympic medallist [[Nellie Kim]] told ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=NYTjuly27-08&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeré and Juliet Macur |last=Longman |title=Records Say Chinese Gymnasts May Be Under Age |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210163814/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html| archivedate=December 10, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniela Silivaş, in her interview, commented, "You should know that I competed better at the age of 13 than at 17. I felt much better, physical ''(sic)'' and mentally."&lt;ref name=prosport /&gt;

Physically, younger gymnasts, particularly those who have not yet gone through [[puberty]], tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbbc&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Row over ages of winning gymnasts |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7570000/newsid_7576600/7576667.stm |publisher=BBC/CBBC Newsround |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081005084514/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7570000/newsid_7576600/7576667.stm| archivedate= 5 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] after the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lgipb&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Joan | title = Little Girls in Pretty Boxes | publisher = Doubleday | location = Garden City | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-385-47790-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more likely to be able to work through pain while injured.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt;&lt;ref name=lgipb /&gt;

===Major verified cases of age falsification===
'''[[Kim Gwang Suk]]''' ([[North Korea]]): Kim, the 1991 World Champion on the [[uneven bars]], was active on the international circuit between 1987 and 1993. During this time, several observers claimed she was too young for senior competition.  The North Korean Gymnastics Federation submitted inconsistent dates of birth for Kim at various competitions, claiming that she was 15 for three consecutive years. As punishment, the F.I.G. barred the North Korean women's team from the World Championships in 1993.  She competed in the [[1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1989 World Championships]] at the estimated age of 11 or 12.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/04/19/gym.t.php "Gold Medalist and His Team May Be Barred From Olympic Games : Last Chance for a North Korean Athlete"] Christopher Clarey, ''International Herald Times,'' Friday, April 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  However, she may have been younger than that.  At the 1992 Olympics, she claimed she was 17.  However, her front teeth were missing, leading [[Béla Károlyi]] to speculate that she may have been as young as 10 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;NBC coverage of the 1992 Olympics team compulsories&lt;/ref&gt;

The F.I.G. responded in October 2010 by provisionally banning North Korea from competition for one month, which effectively barred them from the 2010 World Championships.&lt;ref name=hongsujong&gt;[http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1996:fig-rejects-appeal-no-worlds-for-north-korea&amp;catid=2:news&amp;Itemid=53 "FIG Rejects Appeal; No Worlds for North Korea  "] Amanda Turner, ''International Gymnast'', October 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, the F.I.G. extended the ban until October 5, 2012, fined the North Korean Federation $20,800, and banned Hong from competing even in national competition within North Korea.&lt;ref name=hongsujong2&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jacp4SjgEco9xGVjAiHSmA73HAhw?docId=ff673b0d85a244f99dd9db55aa7a00f9 "North Korea banned 2 years for age falsification"] Associated Press, November 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ballerina skirt''' is a full [[skirt]] that reaches to mid-calf or just above the [[ankle]]s, worn as a costume in a ballet performance. It is often made up of multiple layers of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Cumming, C. W. Cunnington, P. E. Cunnington, ''The Dictionary of Fashion History'', Berg, 2010, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; It was a popular casual skirt style during the 1950s.

Ballerina skirts have been a consistently popular length for formal dresses, especially for young [[women]].The most persistent image of a ballerina skirt is that worn by the most famous ballerina [[Anna Pavlova]]. Early ballerina skirts were heavy, bulky and unwieldy, severely restricting the dancer's movements. By the early twentieth century, skirts were raised to the knees to showcase pointe work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion|url=http://angelasancartier.net/ballet-costume|website=Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion RSS|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ballerina skirt is typically made up of five to 12 layers of tulle fabric. A ballerina skirt typically allows the wearer to seem more beautiful, feminine and elegant, as well as being associated with the traditional costume for  classical ballet performances.

Different types of the ballerina skirts are used in ballet performance including the romantic, classic, pancake, balanchine and platter skirts.

'''Boardsports''' are sports that are played with some sort of board as the primary equipment. These sports take place on a variety of terrain, from paved flat-ground and snow-covered hills to water and air. Most boardsports are considered action sports or [[extreme sports]], and thus often appeal to youth. A large proportion of youth partaking in these sports, together with aesthetic damage to property from sports like skateboarding, has led to many board sports being marginalized by the greater world of sports in the past. However, many board sports are ever-more frequently gaining mainstream recognition, and with this recognition have enjoyed wider broadcast, sponsorship and inclusion in institutional sporting events, including the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716183518/http://www.tackyworld.com/skateboard/article/?id=107551 It's Official: Skateboarding Joins the Olympics - Article - Tackyworld.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surfing]] was the first boardsport, originating from [[Polynesian culture]]. [[Skateboarding]] was then invented by surfers looking to "surf" on land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/skateboard.html Inventor of the Week: Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to estimate when most boardsports were "invented" because people have been making homemade versions throughout history. For example, it is not hard to conceive of a person, who is familiar with the concept of [[skiing]] or [[sledding]], standing sideways on a plank of wood and riding down a snow-covered slope. M.J. "Jack" Burchett is credited with first doing this in 1929, using horse reins and clothesline to secure his feet on the plank of wood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowboardinghistory.com/ Snowboarding History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116084703/http://www.snowboardinghistory.com/ |date=January 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most boardsports have similar, equally unknown origins.

Using data collected in the past decade, it is estimated there are 18-50 million skateboarders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/skateboarding.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204013828/http://hickoksports.com/history/skateboarding.shtml#hist1 |archive-date=2010-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4021/is_2002_Oct_1/ai_92087410/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-25 million surfers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfline.com/community/whoknows/whoknows.cfm?id=1012 Number Of Surfers In The World | Surfline.Com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 10-20 million [[snowboarder]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuropeans.com/topic/sports/powderhausen/history/ Neuropeans - Arts, Sports, MKP2001, Neurope Tower, Europanto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=587281&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; in the world.

==Classifications== 
There are a variety of board sports, which are characterized by terrain: Surf, Snow, Wake, Skate are the primary.

===Water===

;[[Surfing]]: The grandfather of all board sports, is a surface water sport that involves the participant being carried by a breaking wave.
;[[Stand Up Paddle Surfing|Stand Up Paddle Surfing (SUP)]]:A variant of surfing where one always a stands up on the board and propels oneself by a one-bladed paddle, without lying down on the board. Although originally the goal was to catch and surf the waves, a racing modality has emerged with similarities to kayaking.
;[[Skimboarding]] (1930s) :A discipline of surfing involving riding a board on wet sand or shallow water. A predominantly recreational activity that has evolved into a highly competitive water sport.
;[[Windsurfing]] (1970) : Also known as ''sailboarding''. A water sport involving travel over water on a small 2-4.7 metre board powered by wind acting on a single sail. The sail is connected to the board by a flexible joint
;[[Bodyboarding]] (1971) : Wave riding consisting of a small, roughly rectangular piece of foam, shaped to a hydrodynamic form. The bodyboard is ridden predominantly lying down, (or 'prone'). It can also be ridden in a half-standing stance (known as 'dropknee') or can even be ridden standing up.
;[[Kneeboarding]] (1973) :A discipline of surfing where the rider paddles on his belly into a wave on a kneeboard, then rides the wave face typically on both knees.
;[[Riverboarding]] (1978) : A boardsport in which the participant is prone on the board with fins on his/her feet for propulsion and steering.
;[[Wakeboarding]] (1983) : A surface watersport created from a combination of water skiing, snow boarding and surfing techniques. As in water skiing, the rider is towed behind a boat, or a [[cable skiing]] setup.
;[[Skurfing]] (1984) :Another fast growing boardsport is [[skurfing]] a mix of surfing and more conventional water sports in which the participant is towed behind the boat.
;[[Flowriding]] (1991) : Similar to surfing but done on a man-made artificial sheet wave.
;[[Wakeskating]] (1990s) :A rider is pulled behind a boat on a wakeskate which is smaller than a wakeboard and has no bindings with a foam or griptape surface.
;[[Kitesurfing]] (1996) : Also known as ''kiteboarding''. Boards similar to those known from windsurfing or wakeboarding are propelled by an inflatable or foil power kite, allowing for high speeds and high jumps. Other variations are to use a wheeled board or buggy on land, or skis or a snowboard on snow.
; [[Wakesurfing]] (1997) : A rider is pulled behind a boat on a mini surfboard and can ride the boat's wake with no rope.

===Land===
====Paved surface====

;[[Skateboarding]] (1950) : Uses a board mounted on wheels, and often ridden on a half-pipe, in urban settings, or emptied specially built swimming pools. 
;[[Longboarding]] (1970s) : Similar to freeboarding but with long skateboards that come in different shapes and sizes, longboarding is mostly a racing sport but there are many other styles as well.
;[[Snakeboard]] (1989) : Similar to skateboarding, but also influenced heavily by snowboarding. 
;[[Freestyle scootering]] (1996) : an action sport which involves using scooters to perform freestyle tricks, in a manner similar to skateboarding and BMX freestyle.
; [[Carveboarding]] : A board that has wheels similar to a car except smaller, it turns better than most boards on four wheels, its main purpose is to cruise and carve, it can turn 65 degrees, and has spring-loaded trucks that are almost as unique as a flowboards trucks.
;[[Freeboard (skateboard)|Freeboarding]]: Often said to be the board whose feel is the most similar to snowboarding. There are two extra castor wheels in the middle of the base that are somewhat lower than the other four. This allows the rider to distribute his weight to only one "edge", as in snowboarding. This gives the rider the ability to slide, an ability no other land board has besides the longboard.
;[[Caster board]] : Two narrow platforms known as "decks" are adjoined by a rubber or aluminium coated metal beam that houses a strong spring. Each truck has one wheel that is connected to the board in such a way that each wheel can rotate independently. Both wheels are mounted on slants that measure around 30� in angle, facing away from the front of the board. Similar to [[Vigorboard]] (2003) : Constructed from two platforms, each supported by a single caster with a single wheel giving the board a total of two wheels. the two platforms are connected by heavy metal torsion bar that enables the board to twist in the centre.
; [[Skurfing#Street Skurfing|Street Skurfing]] : Similar to Caster board, but the rider can move both feet independently.
; [[Freeline skates]] (2000's) : A pair of skates designed to give the feeling of skateboarding, snowboarding, surfing, and inline skates all in one. Freeline Skates are extremely portable, making them the smallest and lightest form of transportation. See also [[Skurfing#Street Skurfing|Street Skurfing]].
; [[Street surfing]] : A split deck board connected by a spring rod to allow each half of the board to twist independently from the other, each side only having 1 caster wheel, allowing for tight maneuvers and self propulsion.
; [[On-shore boards]] : A type of board that has four inline wheels and four in the back(two on each side) and is deeply concave in the front.
;[[T-board]]ing :A skateboard deck with two wheels that can spin 360 degrees.

====Off-paved surface====

;[[Land windsurfing]]: A sport similar to traditional windsurfing that is performed on land rather than water. A four-wheeled deck, similar to a mountain board or skateboard deck, is commonly used in conjunction with a mast and sail in order to project the board across land.
;[[Mountainboarding]] (1992) : Similar to snowboarding, but on snowless peaks (in between winter seasons). The board is wider and sturdier. [[Mountainboarding]] is similar to skateboarding in the way that mountainbiking is similar to regular biking.
;[[Kite landboarding]]: Similar to Kite Surfing but the kite is used to pull the rider along flat ground (often a hard packed sandy beach) on a mountainboard.

====Snow====

;[[Snowboarding]] (1977) :A cross between skateboarding and skiing, the board medium is snow, although the condition of the snow can have a major impact on snowboarding style and technique. The four subcategories are freeride, freestyle, alpine and powder.
;[[Snowskating]] (1998) :This is similar to snowboarding but there are no bindings used. Instead the snow skate has a foam grip similar to griptape, enabling you to do skateboard style tricks. There are four main types of snowskates: Single deck (a skateboard-deck-like platform made out of either wood and/or plastic)
; Bilevel (similar to a skate board but, instead of trucks and wheels, a small ski with metal edges called a subdeck is used with special trucks to be used on a ski hill);4x4 (a skateboard but the wheels are replaced by very small skis); Powderskate (can either be like a Bilevel snowskate or a single deck snowskate but longer and wider).
;[[Snowkiting]]: This is when a kite is used to pull a snowboarder along.

====Sand====

;[[Sandboarding]]: A recreational activity similar to snowboarding that takes place on sand dunes rather than snow-covered hills.

===Air===

;[[Skysurfing]]: A kind of skydiving in which the skydiver wears a board attached to their feet and performs surfing-style aerobatics during freefall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">The '''''Canadian Football Act''''' (1974), also known in its long title as '''''An Act respecting Canadian Professional Football''''', was a proposed [[Act of Parliament|Act]] by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in April 1974 designed to give a government-protected [[monopoly]] over [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[Canadian football|football]] in Canada to the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). Although it was never signed into law, the move by the government eventually compelled the [[World Football League]]'s [[Toronto Northmen]] to move to the [[United States]] as the [[Memphis Southmen]]. The spectre of the Act was again raised when [[John F. Bassett]], the owner of the Northmen/Southmen franchise, proposed a [[United States Football League]] franchise for [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1983.

In 2007, there was speculation that a similar act would develop if the [[National Football League]] attempted to [[National Football League in Toronto|expand to Toronto]] and thus threaten the Canadian league's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/64892 NFL's New Hot Market Is North of the Border - October 19, 2007 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an act would likely still allow for an NFL team to play in Canada in an NFL preseason game and the CFL's off season; thus allowing for a Canadian city to host the Super Bowl if the NFL decided to host their premier event in a stadium far from an NFL city.{{citation needed|date = December 2018}}

It is also unlikely that any future act will be passed to affect American college football, such as the [[NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], who have or have had teams based in Canada  ([[Simon Fraser University]] being the lone NCAA member in Canada) and bowl games hosted in Canadian cities, with no opposition, in part because the CFL draws some of its players from American college teams (and, in the case of bowl games, because their December and January scheduling is well after [[U Sports football|Canadian university football]] ends its season).

==Details==
* Designated C-22.
* Introduced by the [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]], [[Marc Lalonde]].
* Claimed it would protect the Canadian Football League, would allow the CFL to grow and develop its own distinct character
* Of the mayors of the nine CFL cities at the time, only three were against the ''Canadian Football Act''. They were the mayors of [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[List of mayors of Montreal|Montreal]] and [[List of Toronto mayors|Toronto]], also the biggest cities of Canada then and now, with two of them hosting teams from leagues that played a different code of football. Montreal played host to one of the [[World League of American Football]] teams, the [[Montréal Machine]], in the early 1990s after their CFL team folded in the late 1980s. Toronto were hosts to an [[Arena Football League]] team for two seasons, the [[Toronto Phantoms]].
* After the bill passed second reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], it was given to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs, where it effectively died after the Northmen moved to Memphis.
* Clause 6 in the ''Act'' stated that no person that owns, operates, or manages a team in a league foreign from the CFL shall play in Canada. Subsection 2 stated that no player or member of the said team shall play in Canada, therefore if the bill passed and became law, it would effectively kill teams like the Northmen.

These facts were gathered from the actual debates held in the House of Commons from April 10 to April 28, 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79482">In [[sport]]s, the terms '''Cinderella''', '''"Cinderella story"''', and '''Cinderella team''' are used to refer to situations in which competitors achieve far greater success than would reasonably have been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=list/cinderellastories|title=ESPN.com: Page 2 : Who are the greatest Cinderella stories?|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/2004/March/26/sports2.asp |title=Cinderella stories: Battling from the bottom up |last1=Kim |first1=Suzie |date=26 March 2004 |publisher=The Gazette |accessdate=28 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716232231/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/2004/March/26/sports2.asp |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinderella stories tend to gain much media and fan attention as they move closer to the championship game at the end of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/march-madness5.htm |title=How March Madness Works |last1=Bonsor |first1=Kevin |website=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from ''[[Cinderella]]'', a well-known European folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression/triumphant reward. The title character is a woman living in unfortunate circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. In a sporting context the term has been used at least since 1939, but came into widespread usage in 1950, when [[Cinderella (1950 film)|the Disney movie]] came out that year, and in reference to [[City College of New York]], the unexpected winners of the NCAA Men's Basketball championship also that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g42TyP-V5C8C&amp;pg=PR41&amp;lpg=PR41&amp;dq=Pat+Forde+College+Basketball+Encyclopedia+Cinderella&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cYNEeKNejy&amp;sig=d42TdANaMvqbHSmDyPJj3dbr_qU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wfKXTd2mDoi3tgfstb3qCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game|author=ESPN|location=New York|publisher=ESPN Books|year=2009|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was used by [[Bill Murray]] in the 1980 hit movie ''[[Caddyshack]]'' where he pretends as the announcer to his own golf fantasy: "Cinderella story. Outta nowhere. A former greenskeeper, now, about to become the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] champion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soundclip of Bill Murray in Caddyshack|url=http://www.moviesoundscentral.com/sounds/caddyshack/cinderellastory.wav |work=MovieSoundsCentral |accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring somewhat inaccurately to the plot details of the classic ''Cinderella'' story, the media will debate whether the given "Cinderella" team or player will "turn into a pumpkin", i.e. fail to win the prize and then return to its former obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Sports/2013/0322/March-Madness-2013-Is-Harvard-the-next-Cinderella "...hopeful that Cinderella's magical carriage won't turn into a pumpkin just yet."&lt;/ref&gt; In the fairy tale, it was the carriage that turned into a pumpkin at midnight, not Cinderella herself. Another popular term is "strike midnight", when a Cinderella team does finally get beaten.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://www.wric.com/story/4714251/clock-strikes-midnight-for-cinderella-team-george-mason |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212181504/http://www.wric.com/story/4714251/clock-strikes-midnight-for-cinderella-team-george-mason |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }} "Clock Strikes Midnight For Cinderella Team George Mason"&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the widespread use of "Cinderella" in this way, the more common term for unexpected and dramatic success was "Miracle", as in the "Miracle [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]]" of [[1914 Boston Braves season|1914]], the "[[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Miracle of Coogan's Bluff]]" in 1951, the "[[1969 World Series|Miracle Mets]]" of 1969, and the "[[Miracle on Ice]]" in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twicetoldarchive.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/miracle-on-ice/|title="Miracle on Ice"|first=Elisabeth|last=Gruner|date=4 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinderella teams are also referred to as a '''surprise package''' or '''surprise packet''', and their success would be termed a '''fairy-tale run'''.&lt;ref name="Fairy-Tale"/&gt; A related concept is the '''giant-killer''', which refers to a lesser competitor who defeats a favorite, reflecting the story of [[David and Goliath]].
&lt;!--The following is ONLY AN EXAMPLE LIST. Every case of a cinderella team does not need to be listed. Please discuss a new example/player on the talk page before adding it.--&gt;

==Examples of "Cinderellas"==
Many teams are considered "Cinderella teams" when they seemingly overachieve. For example, the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and the [[Arizona Cardinals]] went all the way to their respective leagues' championships in 2008 only to "turn into a pumpkin" at the end. This list is largely confined to "Cinderella teams" that won championships.

*[[1999 St. Louis Rams season|1999 St. Louis Rams]] – After losing starting [[quarterback]] Trent Green in the pre-season, many suspected the Rams' season was over. However, Green's undrafted backup and eventual NFL MVP [[Kurt Warner]] led the Rams to a 13-3 record, their first winning record in 10 seasons. After defeating the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the NFC playoffs, the Rams captured their first and only Super Bowl by defeating the [[Tennessee Titans]] 23-16 at [[Super Bowl XXXIV]].&lt;ref name="NFLcom_Cinderella_Stories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turfshowtimes.com/2014/11/5/7159301/austin-davis-hero-or-zero |title=Rams Mid-Season Report Card: Quarterback |last1=Martel |first1=Charles |date=5 November 2014 |website=turfshowtimes.com |publisher=SB Nation |accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2001 New England Patriots season|2001 New England Patriots]] - The Patriots began the season 1-3, and lost their starting quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] in the second game of the season.  Tom Brady took over as quarterback and lead the team to an 11-5 finish, winning the AFC East title.  The season ended with a 20-17 upset over the St. Louis Rams in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].  The team had been in a period of decline for several years previously, and had finished 5-11 the previous season.  This season marked the beginning of the Patriots' dynasty.
*[[2007 New York Giants season|2007 New York Giants]]&lt;ref name="NFLcom_Cinderella_Stories" /&gt; – In 2007, the 5th seeded Giants, who went 10-6 in the regular season, won four playoff games on the road, including wins over the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Green Bay Packers]], and culminating in a win over the 18-0 [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]]. 3 of the 4 Giants' playoff victories were against teams they had lost to in the regular season (Cowboys twice).&lt;ref name="NFLcom_Cinderella_Stories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History derailed: Giants ruin Patriots' quest for perfection with 17-14 stunner|date=February 4, 2008|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=Boston Globe|page=A1|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, their 10-6 regular season record was tied for the worst record among teams to win the Super Bowl. Today, the only Super Bowl-winning team to have a worse regular season record is the [[2011 New York Giants season|2011 New York Giants]], who, after a 9-7 regular season, again defeated the Patriots in [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.axs.com/news/the-axs-six-pack-worst-records-to-win-the-super-bowl-73043 |title=The AXS Six-pack: Worst records to win the Super Bowl |date=28 December 2015 |website=AXS.com |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2017 Philadelphia Eagles season|2017 Philadelphia Eagles]] - The Eagles came into the season surrounded by doubts involving second-year quarterback [[Carson Wentz]] and head coach [[Doug Pederson]]. While the team started off the season strong by going 11-2, injuries caught up to them as Carson Wentz was ruled out for the season following a torn ACL in Week 14. Franchise left-tackle [[Jason Peters]] and linebacker [[Jordan Hicks]] missed extended periods of time. Backup quarterback [[Nick Foles]] took the reins from Wentz and led Philadelphia to an upset victory over the New England Patriots in [[Super Bowl LII]], where he was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/02/05/super-bow-52-philadelphia-eagles-doug-pederson-nick-foles-malcolm-butler|title=‘A Team Makes a Miracle’: How the Underdog Eagles Became the Unlikeliest Super Bowl Champs|date=5 February 2018 |website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[2006 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest Demon Deacons]] (2006) – Wake Forest won the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] title after being picked by the media to finish last in their division, and after losing their [[Ben Mauk|starting quarterback]], starting running back, and starting left offensive tackle to injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collegesports.net/acc/2013/12/06/acc-flashback-friday-2006-wake-forest-demon-deacons/ |title=ACC Flashback Friday: 2006 Wake Forest Demon Deacons |last1=Ferguson |first1=Mike |date=6 December 2013 |website=collegesports.net |accessdate=28 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304110039/http://collegesports.net/acc/2013/12/06/acc-flashback-friday-2006-wake-forest-demon-deacons/ |archivedate=4 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team and star linebacker [[Jon Abbate]] became the subject of a 2011 feature film, ''[[The 5th Quarter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wakeforestsports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101107aaa.html |title=The Jon Abbate Story to Become Motion Picture |website=WakeForestSports.com |publisher=Wake Forest Football |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wake Forest was invited to the Orange Bowl, but lost to Louisville 24-13.

*[[2018 Washington Valor season|Washington Valor]] (2018) –(This one doesn’t really count because the AFL has only 4 teams.) The Valor finished the regular season with a 2–10 record, leaving themselves in last place among the four teams competing that season, who all advanced to the league's playoffs. The team defeated the [[Albany Empire (AFL)|Albany Empire]] 103–97 in a [[two-legged tie|two-game total points series]] before facing the [[Baltimore Brigade]] in [[ArenaBowl XXXI]]. With the Valor's 69–55 victory over the Brigade in the championship game, they became the first team with a regular season winning percentage lower than .250 to win a championship in the history of the [[Arena Football League|AFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fominykh |first1=Katherine |title=Valor outrun, outsmart Brigade to claim first ArenaBowl title, 69-55 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/baltimore-brigade/bs-sp-baltimore-brigade-arenabowl-recap-20180728-story.html |accessdate=July 29, 2018 |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zielonka|first=Adam|title=Why Arena Football League fans still support the game|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/29/why-arena-football-league-fans-still-support-game/|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=July 29, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] ([[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]]) – Denmark won Euro 92 after originally failing to qualify. They qualified for the tournament as a replacement team after [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], who had initially won the group, was the subject of [[United Nations]] sporting [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|sanctions]] following its [[Yugoslav Wars|civil war]]. They advanced from the group stage after winning their last match against [[France national football team|France]] and then through goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] saving a penalty in the semi-final [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] from [[Marco van Basten]] of defending European champions, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].

*[[Greece national football team|Greece]]  ([[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]) – Greece were the second-least favorite in the competition to win, with Latvia being the least favorite. Greece was also considered as outsiders and underdogs and was given odds of 150-1 of winning before the tournament. They were drawn in Group A, ending up with Portugal, Spain, and Russia, a "group of death"; Portugal, hosts and favourites to win, Spain, former European champions, and Russia, who won the first-ever Euro as the Soviet Union. Very few people expected Greece to proceed to the quarter-finals, let alone win the tournament. Greece won the final 1–0, defying odds of 80–1 from the beginning of the tournament, with [[Angelos Charisteas]] scoring the winning goal in the 57th minute. While the dedication of the side and the victory were celebrated by their nation, Greece were dubbed by [[Barry Glendenning]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the only underdogs in history that everyone wants to see get beaten", due to Greece's rough defensive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portugal 0–1 Greece |first=Barry |last=Glendenning |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jul/04/minutebyminute.sport |work=The Guardian |date=5 July 2004 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Boston Red Sox]] ([[2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004]]) – The 2004 Red Sox ended an [[Curse of the Bambino|86-year World Series drought]] by winning eight straight games to come back from a 3-0 [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] deficit against their rival [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]]. While most Cinderella teams come from relative obscurity to win a championship, the 2004 Red Sox won 98 regular season games and were a dominant team throughout the 2004 regular season. They did however beat a NY Yankees team which won 101 games, along with sweeping the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] who won a league best 105 regular season games. However, their Cinderella status was established after becoming the first Major League Baseball team to overcome a 3-0 deficit in a 7-game series and only the third team in Major American professional sports to achieve such a feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greatest best-of-7 comeback ever |url=http://www.whowins.com/features/comeback.html |work=whowins.com |publisher=WhoWins |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shaughnessy |first=Dan |date=6 April 2006 |title=Reversing the Curse: Inside the 2004 Boston Red Sox |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kl5zRIAsiKkC&amp;dq=2004+boston+red+sox+cinderella |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=9780547346939 |accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===

====NBA====
*[[Boston Celtics]] (1969) – The Boston Celtics were coming off a championship against [[Jerry West]], [[Elgin Baylor]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and superstar Center [[Bill Russell]] was heading into what would be his final year. The aging Celtics had won 10 of the previous 12 NBA Championships, but with offensive powerhouse [[Wilt Chamberlain]] joining the already powerful Lakers, it appeared as if the Celtics, who were practically limping into the Finals, would easily be taken care of the old squad. The Celtics fell into a quick 3-2 deficit but came back to force a Game 7 in Los Angeles, with Bill Russell calmly stating "One thing the Lakers cannot do, is beat us". With the Lakers preparing balloons and confetti for "when, not if, they win", the Celtics took inspiration from their arrogance and went on to win it with a key circus basket by [[Don Nelson]] that bounced high from the back of the rim before sailing through the net. The win sent Russell and fellow hall of famer [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]] to retirement as champions, with Russell winning his 11th championship and Jones his tenth.&lt;ref name="NESN Top 10 Cinderellas" /&gt;

The Wildcat squad remains the only eighth-seed and the lowest overall seed in tournament history to win the championship. 

===Canadian football===
*[[1989 CFL season|1989 Saskatchewan Roughriders]] – The Roughriders finished the season with a 9-9 record and made an improbable run to the [[77th Grey Cup]]. The team went into the playoffs on a three-game losing streak, but upset the 10-8 [[Calgary Stampeders]] 33-26 in the West Division Semi-Final before upsetting the heavily favoured [[Edmonton Eskimos]] (who finished the season with a 16-2 record) in the West Division Final, 32-21. This victory set up the Grey Cup game against the 12-6 [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]].

====NHL====
*[[Chicago Black Hawks]] ([[1937–38 Chicago Black Hawks season|1938]])&amp;nbsp;– The Black Hawks would struggle with a 14-25-9 record. However, they earned a playoff spot, and in the first series, took on the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. Although they lost the first game of the series, the Hawks would win the next two games including a shocker 3–2 OT victory at Montreal. Then, they faced the [[New York Americans]]. Like the first series, the Hawks would drop the opening game, before winning the next two games. In the [[1938 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], they took on the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. The Black Hawks won the first game before dropping the second game. Then the Hawks won the next two games to take home their second Stanley Cup. They are considered the biggest Cinderella story in NHL history and they became the first pro sports team to win a championship with a losing record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatesthockeylegends.com/2008/04/1930s-hawks-had-american-dreams.html|title=1930s Hawks Had American Dreams|first=Joe|last=Pelletier|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Washington Capitals]] ([[2017–18 Washington Capitals season|2018]]) – After years of playoff failure under the leadership of captain [[Alexander Ovechkin]], many expected the Capitals to miss the [[2018 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. During the offseason, they lost a great amount of talent, including mainstays [[Karl Alzner]], [[Justin Williams]], [[Marcus Johansson (ice hockey, born 1990)|Marcus Johansson]], [[Kevin Shattenkirk]], [[Nate Schmidt]], and many others. After a slow 11-10-1 start, rumors that head coach [[Barry Trotz]] would be fired began to circulate. The Capitals rebounded to win the Metropolitan division with 105 points, but they continued to fly under the radar as Stanley Cup contenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Svrluga |first1=Barry |last2=Khurshudyan |first2=Isabelle |title=The Capitals’ season — from bitter disappointment to a Stanley Cup |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/the-capitals-season--from-bitter-disappointment-to-a-stanley-cup/2018/06/09/6ba5a534-6c05-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html?utm_term=.7c4ac5141c34 |website=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=3 July 2018 |date=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Capitals endured substantial hardships in the playoffs to reach their first Stanley Cup Finals in 20 years, defying anticipations that they would not survive past the second round like in prior seasons.  Through 19 games, they struggled through a fateful 2-0 series deficit against the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in round one, a limited roster against the defending back-to-back champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in round two, and the perils of [[Choke (sports)|choking]] to the heavily favored, conference-leading [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in the Conference Final, to reach the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Vegas Golden Knights]], which they had yet to beat in a game.  After dropping the first game of the Finals, the Capitals finally ended their misery with four consecutive wins to defeat the Knights and clinch the franchise's first-ever [[Stanley Cup]].  By season's end, Ovechkin had won the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as the [[most valuable player]] of the playoffs, scoring 15 goals in 24 playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Steinberg |first1=Dan |last2=Hume |first2=Mike |title=For the Capitals, it’s about time: The series of events that left Washington on the precipice of its first Stanley Cup. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2018/05/28/feature/the-washington-capitals-path-to-the-2018-stanley-cup-finals/?utm_term=.cda28a5c90d6 |website=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=3 July 2018 |date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Pyeongchang Olympics, the German team would eventually make it to the gold medal match, defeating powerhouses [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]] on the way, only to settle for silver after the [[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]] scored the game-winning goal in overtime for a 4-3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-iceh-m-oar-ger-miracle/ice-hockey-silver-is-miracle-enough-for-germany-idUSKCN1G90AF|title=Ice hockey: Silver is miracle enough for Germany|last=Keating|first=Steve|date=2018-02-25|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[2004 NRL season|2004]], the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] reached the finals for the first time in their 10-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-09-20/latham-backs-cinderella-story-cowboys/555462|title=Latham backs 'Cinderella-story' Cowboys|date=20 September 2004|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finishing seventh at the end of the regular season, the Cowboys were drawn against the second-placed [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] in the first week of the finals and pulled off a major upset by winning 30–22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/12/1094789744787.html|title=Fearless Cowboys round up the Dogs - League - www.smh.com.au|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They followed this up with a 10–0 defeat of the [[Brisbane Broncos]] on their [[Willows Sports Complex|home ground]]; this marked the first time the Cowboys had defeated the Broncos in their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/18/1095394063224.html?from=storylhs|title=Cowboys shut out Broncos in NRL semi - League - www.smh.com.au|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However their run would be ended with a close 19–16 defeat by the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the preliminary final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/26/1096137106010.html|title=Ready Roosters end Cows' dream run - League - www.smh.com.au|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[2005 NRL season|2005]], the [[Wests Tigers]], in just their sixth season of existence, won the premiership. They had never previously made the finals in five seasons and had been as low as 12th on the NRL ladder by the middle of the season. However, they were able to find some good form in the second half of the season to eventually finish the regular season 4th on the ladder. In their first ever finals match, the Tigers scored a big 50–6 victory over the previous year's Cinderella story, the [[North Queensland Cowboys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefanatics.com/sports.news.view.php?id=218231|title=Fanatics|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with a 34–6 victory over the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in the second week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/league/tiger-cubs-savage-broncos/2005/09/18/1126981945308.html|title=Tiger cubs savage Broncos - League - Sport - theage.com.au|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; before going on to upset the premiership favourites [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St. George Illawarra]] 20–12 in the preliminary final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/dragons-dream-over-as-tigers-roll-on/2005/09/24/1126982272190.html|title=Dragons dream over as Tigers roll on - League - Sport - smh.com.au|publisher=|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advanced the Wests Tigers to their first ever [[2005 NRL Grand Final|Grand Final]], which was dubbed the "Battle of the Cinderellas", as their opponents were the North Queensland Cowboys who fell one game short of the decider in 2004 but went one better in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">The '''Czechoslovak Hockey Riots''' were a short lived series of protests, mildly violent on occasion (several people were injured), that took place in response to the [[1969 World Ice Hockey Championships]].

After the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion into Czechoslovakia]] the political ideals of the [[Prague Spring]] were slowly but steadily replaced by politics of accommodation to the demands of the [[Soviet Union]]. People in Czechoslovakia, unable to find other ways to express their opinion, reacted with few very visible but ultimately ineffective manifestations of disagreement.

On March 21 and 28, 1969, the [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team]] beat the [[USSR national ice hockey team|Soviet team]] in the [[1969 World Ice Hockey Championships]] in [[Stockholm]]. Throughout [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], possibly 500,000 fans crowded the streets of their cities to celebrate the wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Williams|first = Kieran|year = 1997|title = The Prague spring and its aftermath : Czechoslovak politics, 1968-1970|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, England|isbn = 0-521-58803-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, particularly [[Prague]], the celebrations turned to protests against the [[Soviet military]] who continued to occupy the country after the [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion the previous August. While the majority of these demonstrations were peaceful, some turned violent as protesters attacked Soviet military units. In Prague, protesters ransacked the Soviet [[Aeroflot]] office, though some have suggested they were encouraged by [[State Security (Czechoslovakia)|State Security]] agents.

The protests were suppressed by the Czechoslovak military and police, now under full control of the hardliners from the Communist Party. The events were used as a pretext to oust the remaining leaders of the Prague Spring. Among them, [[Alexander Dubček]] was forced to resign as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], to be replaced by [[Gustáv Husák]] who started the politics of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalisation]]".

No active protests against the presence of Soviet troops occurred thereafter. During the years of normalization, citizens of Czechoslovakia saw hockey games against Soviet Union as a quiet, symbolic way to protest. Police forces were regularly set on alert but never used.

A '''dispersal draft''' is a process in professional sports for assigning players to a new team when their current team ceases to exist or is merged with another team.  Since most [[Draft (sports)|sports draft]]s are held in [[North America]], this is where most dispersal drafts are conducted as well.

Since no [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports]] team has folded or merged since 1978, dispersal drafts are more commonly seen in emerging sports (such as [[soccer]] or women's [[basketball]] in the [[United States]]) or alternative leagues where initial support for a team failed to remain consistent and the team was unable to survive financially.

==Examples of dispersal drafts==
*The [[National Football League]] held a [[1950 AAFC Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] on June 2, 1950, to allocate players from the four remaining teams in the [[All-America Football Conference]] who would not be joining the NFL.
*The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] had two dispersal drafts in the 1950&amp;ndash;51 season: In October 1950, a dispersal draft for the [[Chicago Stags]] franchise was conducted, and in January 1951, the [[Washington Capitols]] demise led to a second dispersal draft.
*The [[American Basketball Association]] in 1975 had two drafts within a month of each other in October and November 1975 as two teams folded during what turned out to be the final season of the ABA.
*On August 8, 1976, as part of the ABA-NBA merger agreement, a dispersal draft was conducted to assign teams for the players on the two ABA franchises which had folded.
*In June 1978, the NHL allowed the financially struggling Cleveland Barons and Minnesota North Stars to merge under the North Stars banner. The North Stars were allowed to keep some of the players from each team, and the remaining players went into the [[1978 NHL Dispersal Draft]]. 
*In 1991, the [[National Hockey League]] conducted a [[1991 NHL Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] in order to split a new team, the [[San Jose Sharks]], from the [[Minnesota North Stars]] as a compromise after the North Stars owners requested permission to move the financially struggling franchise to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], effectively undoing the 1978 merger.
*In 1996, the [[Canadian Football League]] conducted a dispersal draft which consisted of players from the rosters of the [[Birmingham Barracudas]], [[Memphis Mad Dogs]], [[San Antonio Texans]] and [[Shreveport Pirates]] in order to return the CFL to a nine-team format with all franchises based in Canadian cities. The CFL conducted another dispersal draft the following year, when the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] ceased operations; those players under contract by the team were dispersed amongst the eight remaining teams.
*In 1996 and 1997, the [[Australian Football League]] held an [[expansion draft|expansion and dispersal]] draft as part of the [[1996 AFL Draft|1996 National draft and the 1997 Pre-season draft]] as Port Adelaide would enter the AFL for the 1997 season, and the Brisbane Bears had taken over Fitzroy's playing operations after Fitzroy had folded at the end of Round 22. The Bears were allowed to recruit eight of the 19 Fitzroy players that nominated for the draft as part of the agreement to take the Lions nickname and Fitzroy's remaining AFL property, while three Fitzroy players were taken by Port Adelaide, and the remaining eight players were drafted by other teams. 
*In 2002, [[Major League Soccer]] held a [[2002 MLS Dispersal Draft|dispersal draft]] after shutting down the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and [[Miami Fusion]] teams.
*The [[WNBA]] has had five such drafts: For the 2003 season, after Miami and Portland folded; 2004 season, after Cleveland folded; the 2007 season, after Charlotte folded; the 2008 season, after Houston folded; and the 2010 season, after Sacramento folded.  In each draft, all remaining WNBA teams were allowed a draft pick in reverse order of their regular-season record for the preceding season.
*The [[Major Indoor Soccer League (2001 – 2008)|Major Indoor Soccer League]] shut down the [[San Diego Sockers (2001-2004)|San Diego Sockers]] and [[Monterrey Fury]] in December 2004 as a result of various issues, including unpaid debts and insolvency. Players in those teams were then distributed to the remaining teams in a dispersal draft, and the order of player selection was in reverse order of the winning percentage of the remaining teams (excluding games against San Diego and Monterrey and the playoffs) from the 2003-04 seasons and the 2004-2005 season up to that point.
*On April 9, 2006, the [[Ottawa Renegades]] had their team operations suspended by the [[Canadian Football League]]. On April 12, 2006, the former players still under contract and those that the Renegades had the rights to, were [[CFL Dispersal Draft|distributed]] amongst the remaining eight teams. [[Quarterback]] [[Kerry Joseph]] was selected #1 overall by the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] after they traded with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] for the rights to the #1 pick.
*On January 5, 2007, the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] conducted a one-round seven team dispersal draft after the SPHL terminated the Florida Seals franchise midway through the season; the seven players who were drafted went to their new teams, while the remaining players became free agents.
*The [[United Football League (2009&amp;ndash;)|United Football League]] conducted a dispersal draft prior to the [[2011 UFL season|2011 season]] to accommodate the shutdown of the [[Hartford Colonials]]. Five rounds were held among the UFL's four remaining teams, the twenty players who were drafted went to their new teams, and the remaining players became free agents.
*On September 6, 2013, the [[Arena Football League]] held a dispersal draft to distribute the players of the dormant [[Chicago Rush]] and [[Utah Blaze]] franchises. They referred to the dispersal draft as the "Offseason Assignment Process".
* On November 19, 2014, [[Major League Soccer]] held the [[2014 MLS Dispersal Draft]] to distribute the players of [[Chivas USA]].

'''Exercise intensity''' refers to how much energy is expended when [[exercise|exercising]]. Perceived intensity varies with each person. It has been found that intensity has an effect on what [[fuel]] the body uses and what kind of adaptations the body makes after exercise. Intensity is the amount of physical power (expressed as a percentage of the [[maximal oxygen consumption]]) that the body uses when performing an activity. For example, exercise intensity defines how hard the body has to work to walk a mile in 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports - Publications. (n.d.). President's Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition . Retrieved April 5, 2011, from http://www.fitness.gov/fitness.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures of Intensity==
[[Heart Rate]] is typically used as a measure of exercise intensity.&lt;ref&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max: what do we know, and what do we still need to know Levine, B.D. Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, TX 75231. The Journal of Physiology, 2008 Jan 1;586(1):25-34. Epub 2007 Nov 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Heart rate can be an indicator of the challenge to the [[cardiovascular system]] that the exercise represents.

The most precise measure of intensity is oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the overall metabolic challenge that an exercise imposes. There is a direct linear relationship between intensity of aerobic exercise and VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Our maximum intensity is a reflection of our maximal oxygen consumption ([[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]]). Such a measurement represents a cardiovascular fitness level.&lt;ref&gt;Vehrs, P., Ph.D. (2011). Physical activity guidelines. In Physiology of exercise: An incremental approach (pp. 351-393). Provo, UT: BYU Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is measured in METs (mL/kg/min). One MET, which is equal to 3.5 ml/kg per minute, is considered to be the average resting energy expenditure of a typical human being. Intensity of exercise can be expressed as multiples of resting energy expenditure. An intensity of exercise equivalent to 6 METs means that the energy expenditure of the exercise is six times the resting energy expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Vehrs, P., Ph.D. (2011). Physical activity guidelines. In Physiology of exercise: An
incremental approach (pp. 351-393). Provo, UT: BYU Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Intensity of exercise can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. For example, two individuals with different measures of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max, running at 7&amp;nbsp;mph are running at the same absolute intensity (miles/hour) but a different relative intensity (% of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max expended). The individual with the higher VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max is running at a lower intensity at this pace than the individual with the lower VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max is.&lt;ref&gt;Vehrs, P., Ph.D. (2011). Physical activity guidelines. In Physiology of exercise: An
incremental approach (pp. 351-393). Provo, UT: BYU Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies measure exercise intensity by having subjects perform exercise trials to determine [[peak power output]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Donato|first1=Danielle|last2=West|first2=Daniel|last3=Churchward-Venne|first3=Tyler|last4=Breen|first4=Leigh|last5=Baker|first5=Steven|last6=Phillips|first6=Stuart|title=Influence of aerobic exercise intensity on myofibrillar and mitochondrial protein synthesis in young men during early and late postexercise recovery|journal=American Journal of Physiology. Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=2014|volume=306|issue=9|pages=E1025-E1032|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00487.2013|url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/306/9/E1025|accessdate=14 June 2015|pmc=4010655}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be measured in [[watt]]s, heart rate, or (on a cycle) average [[cadence (cycling)]]. This approach attempts to gauge overall workload.

==Intensity Levels==
[[Exercise]] is categorized into three different intensity levels. These levels include low, moderate, and vigorous and are measured by the [[metabolic equivalent]] of task (aka metabolic equivalent or METs).
The effects of exercise are different at each intensity level (i.e. [[training effect]]). Recommendations to lead a healthy lifestyle vary for individuals based on age, weight, and existing activity levels. “Published guidelines for healthy adults state that 20-60 minutes of medium intensity continuous or intermittent aerobic activity 3-5 times per week is needed for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, and muscular strength.”&lt;ref&gt;Elmahgoub, S. S., Calders, P., Lambers, S., Stegen, S. M., Van Laethem, C., &amp; Cambier, D. C. (2011). The effect of combined exercise training in adolescents who are overweight or obese with intellectual disability: The role of training frequency .

==Fuel Used==
The body uses different amounts of energy substrates ([[carbohydrates]] or [[fat]]s) depending on the intensity of the exercise and the [[heart rate (exercise)|heart rate]] of the exerciser. [[Protein]] is a third energy substrate, but it contributes minimally and is therefore discounted in the percent contribution graphs reflecting different intensities of exercise. The fuel provided by the body dictates an individual's capacity to increase the intensity level of a given activity. In other words, the intensity level of an activity determines the order of fuel recruitment. Specifically, exercise physiology dictates that low intensity, long duration exercise provides a larger percentage of fat contribution in the calories burned because the body does not need to quickly and efficiently produce energy (i.e., [[adenosine triphosphate]]) to maintain the activity. On the other hand, high intensity activity utilizes a larger percentage of carbohydrates in the calories expended because its quick production of energy makes it the preferred energy substrate for high intensity exercise. High intensity activity also yields a higher total caloric expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Vehrs, P., Ph.D. (2011). Physical activity guidelines. In Physiology of exercise: An incremental approach (pp. 351-393). Provo, UT: BYU Academic Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

These estimates are valid only when glycogen reserves are able to cover the energy needs. If a person depletes glycogen reserves after a long workout (a phenomenon known as "[[hitting the wall]]") or during a low carbohydrate diet, the body will shift into [[ketosis]] and use mostly fat and muscle for energy. [[Intermittent fasting]] can be used to train the body to shift easily into ketosis.

'''Floor-barre''' is a technique in ballet training that "takes the basic [[ballet barre]] training from the standing position to the floor, "taking the effort of standing out of the equation."

[[Zena Rommett]](R) originated Floor Barre in the 1960s in New York City one day in class, when she found herself telling the students at the ballet barre to "just lie down on the floor and start all over again." Zena Rommett spent her lifetime further refining and passing on her technique until her death at 89 in New York City. 
Floor-Barre(R), a registered trademark for the exclusive use of Zena Rommett and her legally certified Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) teachers,  strengthens the body, lengthens the muscles, and enhance the working of [[ballet]] dancers.  The name of the technique as first used in English by Zena Rommett states its essence, which takes the basic [[ballet barre]] training from the standing position to the floor, "taking the effort of standing out of the equation".
Since 1998 Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) Foundation holds August Certification/Renewal conferences at City Center of New York City, where teachers of Zena Rommett Floor-Barre(R) are certified and re-certified so that the technique will continue to progress instead of fossilizing. Summer conferences in Italy 
According to Rommett, the technique allows the trainees to enhance their precision and posture, making fixes that remain in their [[muscle memory]] and become evident as they go back to train in standing position. Rommett also claims that by training in this technique certain typical dancer injuries can be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Magazine |last= |first= |title=Dance Magazine |trans-title=|date=March 2008 |publisher=DanceMedia, LLC |location= |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com |format= |accessdate=2013-09-08 |archiveurl=http://www.floor-barre.org/Floor-Barre/PRESS.html |archivedate=2013-09-08 |deadurl= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
The benefits of floor barre are limitless. Primarily, there will be less strain on the hip joints.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciandmed.com/mppa/journalviewer.aspx?issue=1116&amp;article=1217&amp;action=1|title=Medical Problems of Performing Artists - Medical Problems of Performing Artists|website=www.sciandmed.com|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, when a dancer is standing at the barre, their [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]] is forced beyond the individual’s range of motion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.performingartspt.com/downloads/ballet_dancer_student_article.pdf|title=The Ballet Dancer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This means that the dancers are using gravity and their weight to forcibly turn their legs out in an attempt to reach that ‘ideal’ 180 degree turnout. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is not natural and can be quite dangerous for the joints. Floor barre emphasizes the importance in utilizing natural turnout by allowing movement that is both gravity resisted and assisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Floor barre is also recommended for dancers recovering from injury because it enforces [[neutral spine]], which corrects improper posture, and is not too strenuous for the recovering body. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bronner|first=Shaw|last2=Ojofeitimi|first2=Sheyi|last3=Rose|first3=Donald|date=June 2008|title=Repair and Rehabilitation of Extensor Hallucis Longus and Brevis Tendon Lacerations in a Professional Dancer|url=https://www.jospt.org/doi/pdf/10.2519/jospt.2008.2749|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy|language=en|volume=38|issue=6|pages=362–370|doi=10.2519/jospt.2008.2749|issn=0190-6011}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a dance specific rehabilitation, it rebuilds strength and natural mobility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/11119c34345f6cf1a3ddaa6f8e29a5c2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=30487|title=Dance-specific, Graded Rehabilitation: Advice, Principles, and Schedule for the General Practitioner - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercises in floor barre can specifically target certain parts of the body such as the [[Psoas muscle|psoas muscles]], hamstrings, or pelvis while still allowing the dancer to focus on increasing center awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearns|first=Lauren W.|date=June 2010|title=Somatics in Action: How “I Feel Three-Dimensional and Real” Improves Dance Education and Training|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15290824.2010.10387158?needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Dance Education|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=35–40|doi=10.1080/15290824.2010.10387158|issn=1529-0824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dancers who over-rotate while utilizing their turnout can experience an overuse based syndrome known as [[Plantar fasciitis|Plantar Fasciitis.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/jmrp/1089313x/v4n2/s5.pdf?expires=1538143247&amp;id=0000&amp;titleid=41000018&amp;checksum=D73C99E89B1AF9AB33D727E5059C4F61|title=Dance Physical Therapy for the Leg and Foot:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7226">'''Functional training''' is a classification of [[exercise]] which involves training the body for the activities performed in [[Everyday life|daily life]].

==Origins==
Functional training has its origins in [[therapy|rehabilitation]].  [[Physical therapy|Physical]] and [[Occupational therapy|occupational]] therapists and [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]] often use this approach to retrain patients with movement disorders. Interventions are designed to incorporate task and context specific practice in areas meaningful to each patient, with an overall goal of functional independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Susan B.|title=Physical Therapy 5th Edition|year=2007|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|location=glossary|isbn=0-8036-1247-8|pages=1335}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, exercises that mimic what patients did at home or work may be included in treatment in order to help them return to their lives or jobs after an injury or surgery.  Thus if a patient's job required repeatedly heavy lifting, rehabilitation would be targeted towards heavy lifting, if the patient were a parent of young children, it would be targeted towards moderate lifting and endurance, and if the patient were a [[marathon]] runner, training would be targeted towards re-building endurance. However, treatments are designed after careful consideration of the patient’s condition, what he or she would like to achieve, and ensuring goals of treatment are realistic and achievable.

Functional training attempts to adapt or develop exercises which allow individuals to perform the activities of daily life more easily and without injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jessec4.htm | title = Functional training | accessdate = 2007-08-26 | last = Cannone | first = Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of body building, functional training involves mainly [[weight bearing]] activities targeted at core [[muscle]]s of the [[Human abdomen#Muscles of the abdominal wall|abdomen]] and lower [[back]]. Fabio Martella wrote that most fitness facilities have a variety of [[Weight machine|weight training machines]] which target and isolate specific muscles.  As a result, the movements do not necessarily bear any relationship to the movements people make in their regular activities or sports.

In rehabilitation, training does not necessarily have to involve weight bearing activities, but can target any task or a combination of tasks that a patient is having difficulty with. [[Balance (ability)|Balance]] training, for example, is often incorporated into a patient’s treatment plan if it has been impaired after injury or disease.

== Evidence ==
[[Physical therapy|Rehabilitation]] after [[stroke]] has evolved over the past 15 years from conventional treatment techniques to task specific training techniques which involve training of basic functions, skills and endurance (muscular and cardiovascular).&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Timmermans, A. A |author2=Spooren, A. I. F. |author3=Kingma, H. |author4=Seleen, H. A.

(2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blennerhassett &amp; Dite. (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blennerhassett, J. |author2= Dite, W. |last-author-amp=yes | year=2004| title=Additional task-related practice improves mobility and upper limb function early after stroke: A randomised controlled trial| journal=Australian journal of physiotherapy| volume=50 | pages=858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASA&gt;[http://www.ebrsr.com/reviews_details.php?Upper-Extremity-Interventions-31 "Upper extremity interventions"], Evidence-based review of stroke rehabilitation&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that task specific training yields long-lasting cortical reorganization which is specific to the areas of the brain being used with each task.&lt;ref name=ASA/&gt; Studies have also shown that patients make larger gains in functional tasks used in their rehabilitation and since they are more likely to continue practicing these tasks in everyday living, better results during follow-up are obtained.&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blennerhassett &amp; Dite. (2004)"/&gt;

== Equipment ==

Some options include:
{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* Clubbells
* Macebells
* [[Cable machine]]s
* [[Barbell]]s
* [[Dumbbell]]s
* [[Medicine ball]]s
* [[Kettlebell]]s
* Bodyweight training
* Physioballs (also called Swiss balls or exercise balls)
* Resistance tubes
* Rocker and wobble boards
* Whole Body Vibration equipment (also called WBV or Acceleration Training)
* Balance disks
* Sandbags
* Suspension system
* Slideboard
* Redcord

}}

In [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] however, equipment is mainly chosen by its relevance to the patient. In many cases equipment needs are minimal and include things that are familiar and useful to the patient.

===Cable machines===
[[Cable machine]]s, also known as pulley machines, are large upright machines, either with a single pulley, or else a pulley attached to both sides.  They allow an athlete to recruit all major muscle groups while moving in multiple planes.  Cable machines also provide a smooth, continuous action which reduces the need for momentum to start repetitions, provide a constant tension on the muscle, peak-contraction is possible at the top of each rep, a safe means of performing [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|negative repetitions]], and a variety of attachments that allow great flexibility in the exercises performed and body parts targeted.

== Components of a functional exercise program ==
To be effective, a functional exercise program should include a number of different elements which can be adapted to an individual's needs or goals:&lt;ref name="Timmermans et al. (2010)"/&gt;
* Based on functional tasks directed toward everyday life activities. 
* Individualized – a training program should be tailored to each individual. Any program must be specific to the goals of an individual, focusing on meaningful tasks. It must also be specific to the individual state of health, including presence or history of injury. An assessment should be performed to help guide exercise selection and training load.
* Integrated – It should include a variety of exercises that work on flexibility, [[core (anatomy)|core]], balance, strength and power, focusing on multiple movement planes.
* Progressive – Progressive training steadily increases the difficulty of the task.
* Periodized – mainly by training with distributed practice and varying the tasks.
* Repeated frequently.
* Use of real life object manipulation.
* Performed in context-specific environments.
* Feedback should be incorporated following performance (self-feedback of success is used as well as trainer/therapist feedback).

'''Georges Hébert''' (27 April 1875 – 2 August 1957) was a pioneering [[physical education|physical educator]] in the [[France|French]] military who developed a system of physical education and training known as "la méthode naturelle" ("Natural Method"), which combined the training of a wide variety of physical capacities with the training of courage and morality.

==Early life==
[[File:Saint-Pierre (Martinique) avec Montage Pelée.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Saint-Pierre, Island of Martinique, with [[Mount Pelée]] in the background]]

[[File:Pelee 1902 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The remains of St Pierre after the 1902 eruption]]

Hébert was born in [[Paris]]. While an officer in the French Navy prior to the [[First World War]], Hébert was stationed in the town of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St. Pierre]], on the island of [[Martinique]] in the Caribbean Sea.  In 1902 the town fell victim to a catastrophic volcanic eruption.

Hébert coordinated the escape and rescue of some seven hundred people from this disaster. This experience had a profound effect on him, and reinforced his belief that [[athletic skill]] must be combined with courage and [[altruism]]. He eventually developed this ethos into his personal motto, "Être fort pour être utile" ("Being strong to be useful").

Hébert had travelled extensively throughout the world and was impressed by the physical development and movement skills of indigenous peoples in [[Africa]] and elsewhere:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, resistant and yet they had no other tutor in gymnastics but their lives in nature.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of his system==
Upon his return to [[France]], Hébert became a physical instructor for the French marines in [[Lorient]], where he began to define the principles of his own system of physical education and to create apparatus and exercises to teach his "Natural Method".

Beyond his observations of the natural movements of indigenous people,  Hébert's method is a synthesis of various influences,&lt;ref&gt; Angel 2016, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; including but not limited to:

*The work of his predecessor [[Francisco Amorós y Ondeano|Francisco Amorós]], who published in 1847 ''Nouveau Manuel Complet d'Education Physique, Gymnastique et Morale'' and which encompasses already the full range of practical movement aptitudes
*The work of German Prussian gymnastics educator [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] (August 11, 1778 – October 15, 1852), which has also probably influenced the early physical training of the [[United States Marine Corps]]
*The classical representations of the human body in Graeco-Roman statuary and by the ideals of the ancient Greek gymnasia
*The [[naturist]] (although strictly rejecting complete nudism) lifestyle principles of his friend Dr. Paul Carton (1875–1947)
*The influence of [[Georges Demenÿ]] (1850–1917), a French inventor, chronophotographer, filmmaker, and gymnast who emphasized the progressiveness and the scalability of the training

Hebert's system rejected [[remedial gymnastics]] and the popular [[Swedish Method]] of [[physical culture]], which seemed to him unable to develop the human body harmoniously and especially unable to prepare his students with the practical and moral demands of life.

[[File:Eakins history of a jump 1885.jpg|thumb|Photo: "history of a jump" 1885]]

In the same way, Hébert believed, by concentrating on competition and performance, competitive sport diverted physical education both from its physiological ends and its ability to foster sound moral values.

For Georges Hébert, influenced by the teachings of philosopher and educationalist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], only the observation of nature could lead people to the true methods of physical development. He wrote:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The final goal of physical education is to make strong beings. In the purely physical sense, the Natural Method promotes the qualities of organic resistance, muscularity and speed, towards being able to walk, run, jump, move on all fours, to climb, to keep balance, to throw, lift, defend yourself and to swim.&lt;br /&gt;
In the "virile" or energetic sense, the system consists in having sufficient energy, willpower, courage, coolness, and firmness.&lt;br /&gt;
In the moral sense, education, by elevating the emotions, directs or maintains the moral drive in a useful and beneficial way.&lt;br /&gt;
The true Natural Method, in its broadest sense, must be considered as the result of these three particular forces; it is a physical, virile and moral synthesis. It resides not only in the muscles and the breath, but above all in the "energy" which is used, the will which directs it and the feeling which guides it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hébert defined the guiding principles and fundamental rules of the Natural Method as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With regard to the development of virile qualities, this is obtained by the execution of certain difficult or dangerous exercises requiring the development of these various qualities, for example while seeking to control the fear of falling, of jumping, of rising, of plunging, of walking on an unstable surface, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Legacy and influence==

[[File:1-10-13, Reims, collège d'athlètes, Bouin lieutenant Hébert.jpg|thumb|(1913) Reims, France; Collège d'athlètes. Hébert is standing to the left. The man to the right is [[Jean Bouin]], the French mid-distance Olympic runner, who died at age 25 while fighting in the French army during the opening weeks of World War 1, in the year 1914.]]
[[File:Collège d'athlètes et agrès.jpg|thumb|Collège d'athlètes ("Athletes' College") was a physical education training center opened in the city of Reims, in north-east France, in 1913.  The center was designed according to the principles of Georges Hébert. The training center was destroyed during World War 1.&lt;ref&gt;Angel 2016, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Jean Bouin 1913 - Collège d'athlètes.jpg|thumb| (1913) Reims, France; Collège d'athlètes. The swimming pool, located to the side of the large indoor training facility.]]

Georges Hébert's teaching continued to expand between and during the two wars, becoming the standard system of French military physical education.

He was also an early advocate of the benefits of exercise for women. In his work "Muscle and Plastic Beauty", which appeared in 1921, Hébert criticized not only the fashion of [[corsetry]] but also the physical inactivity imposed upon women by contemporary European society. By following the natural method of synthesized physical, energetic and moral development, he wrote, women could develop self-confidence, will-power and athletic ability just as well as their male counterparts.

Hébert wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A (Natural Method) session is composed of exercises belonging to the ten fundamental groups: walking, running, jumping, quadrupedal movement, climbing, equilibrium (balancing), throwing, lifting, defending and swimming.&lt;br /&gt;
A training session consists, then, of exercises in an outdoor environment, perhaps a few hundred meters to several kilometers, during which, one walks, one runs, one jumps, one progresses quadrupedally, one climbs, one walks in unstable balance, one raises and one carries, one throws, one fights and one swims.

This course can be carried out in two ways:
#the natural or spontaneous way; i.e., on an unspecified route through the countryside.
#within an especially designed environment.

All of the exercises can be carried out while progressing through this environment. A session can last from 20 to 60 minutes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Hébert was among the earliest proponents of ''le parcours'', or [[obstacle course]], form of [[physical training]], which is now standard in the military and has led to the development of civilian [[fitness trail]]s and [[confidence courses]]. In fact, woodland challenge courses comprising balance beams, ladders, rope swings and so-on are often still described as "Hebertism" or "Hebertisme" courses both in Europe and in North America. It may even be possible to trace modern [[adventure playground equipment]] back to Hébert's original designs in the early 1900s.

As a former [[sailor]], Hébert may have patterned some of his "stations" on the obstacles that are found on the deck of a ship; he was also a strong proponent of "natural" or spontaneous training in non-designed environments.

The year 1955 marked the 50th birthday of the Natural Method, and Hébert was named Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] by the French government in recognition of his many services to his country. In 1957, George Hébert, by then suffering from general [[paralysis]], cultivated the admiration of his entourage by relearning how to walk, speak and write. He died on August 2 of that year in [[Tourgéville]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], France.

There are still schools and gymnasia throughout Europe that are promoting the Natural Method of physical training, some maintaining their own elaborate "parcours" in natural surroundings.

Most recently, Hébert's teachings have been an important influence on the emergence of [[Parkour]] as a training discipline in its own right. Also, in the first decade of the 21st century, the French American physical education instructor [[Erwan Le Corre]] took inspiration from Hébert's "méthode naturelle" ("natural method") and has expanded on the training to form a system of natural movement which he has named "MovNat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1896516/workout-time-forgot |title=The Workout Time Forgot |publisher=Outside Online |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel 2016, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Running-shorts-black.png|thumb|right|A pair of black [[running shorts]]]]
'''Gym shorts''' are an article of clothing typically worn by people when [[exercising]]. They are typically made out of fabrics that allow for maximum comfort and ease, such as nylon. Brands such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Under Armour]], [[Adidas]], and [[Reebok]] all make gym shorts. Cotton gym shorts were made popular by a cheerleading brand called [[Soffe]]. Gym shorts or [[sweatpants]] are required for many junior high and high school [[physical education]] courses.

While gym shorts were traditionally worn by men, from the late 1970s and onward, women began wearing them for better comfort at the gym as well as a modern [[fashion]] trend.

== Changes from short to baggy ==
[[File:MARIANA DE MELO.JPG|thumb|left|Gym shorts worn outdoor]]
Up until the late 1980s, men's gym shorts were very short. Knee-length shorts were rarely seen outside  of [[safari park]]s.

The first time today's "baggy" or "bermuda" look was publicized was when [[Michael Jordan]] wore baggy shorts in the [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] commercial with [[Spike Lee]] in 1988. Another basketball team who emphasized today's men modern style, who were inspired by Michael Jordan, was the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab 5 Wolverines]], who included [[Juwan Howard]], [[Chris Webber]], and [[Jalen Rose]]. After that, the look spread into other [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and other sports. The look quickly expanded into mainstream American culture, and baggy shorts soon replaced upper-thigh shorts outside the sportsworld.

Even as the short shorts became scarce in the NBA, [[John Stockton]] of the [[Utah Jazz]] continued to wear them until his retirement in 2003. Also, during a hardwood classics night on December 31, 2007, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] wore the short shorts against their 1980s rival, the [[Boston Celtics]].

==Today==

Nowadays, gym shorts are worn by adolescents on a daily basis in the spring and summer months.  While some boys prefer shorts that reach the calf, most wear shorts that stop at the knee or just above, propagating the style as fashion.  The appeal of these knee length shorts as warm weather wear is diminishing as most adults find the added length of cloth restrictive and counterproductive in truly active or competitive sports. A modern example of this departure was evident during the 2012 Olympics when the USA men's volleyball team opted for the more athletic-friendly thigh length. The international volleyball federation ([http://www.fivb.org/ FIVB]) now requires men's shorts to have an inseam of at most 10 centimeters (3.9 inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fivb.org/en/volleyball/Documents/FIVB_Volleyball_Sports_Material_Team_Equipment_and_Advertising_Guidelines_20110301.pdf |title=Volleyball Sports Material, Team Equipment and Advertising Guidelines |date=2011-03-01 |publisher=Fédération internationale de volleyball |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter cut gym shorts appear to be slowly returning to popularity for those that favor function over fashion.

Many gym shorts have an inlay made of a comfortable fabric such as [[cotton]], similar to [[swim shorts]]. These are designed to be worn without underwear. The pre-1990s short shorts remain the standard for men in [[running]] activities. Originally, gym shorts were worn by boys and men along with a [[jockstrap]] only underneath.  Schools across the country required boys to wear a ''jock'', also known as an athletic supporter, for all PE/gym activities.  This provided protection from [[testicle torsion]], from squishing them between the thighs, and for modesty purposes. Nowadays, many boys and men wear boxers, boxer briefs, compression shorts, [[swim briefs]] or other standard underwear, although jockstraps are now making a comeback.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A '''hand sack''' is any sack or similar object, typically made of [[cloth]] and filled with sand or a similar material, that is tossed on the back of the hand in a variety of games.

==Origin==
Hand sack originates from the lighter game, a game often played on college campuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Lighter game founded in the greater Burlington Vermont area in the early 90's which spread to the music festival scene and on to college campuses nationwide.

The '''history of [[baseball]]''' can be broken down into various aspects: by era, by locale, by organizational-type, game evolution, well as by political and cultural influence. Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]].

References to baseball date back to the 1700s, and in 1871 the first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], was founded. Five years later, the [[National League]] was created; it was followed by the [[American League]] in 1901. The first [[World Series]] between the champions of the two major leagues was held in 1903, and by 1905 it became an annual event. Baseball early in the 20th century was characterized by low-scoring games, but the [[dead-ball era]] ended in the early 1920s with rule changes and the rise of power hitter [[Babe Ruth]]. The major leagues had a color barrier that lasted until 1947, when [[Jackie Robinson]] made his debut. The major leagues began the process of expansion in 1961 and attendance increase from the mid-1970s to 1994, when a work stoppage led to the cancellation of the World Series.

Professional baseball leagues featured teams from Canada as early as 1877, and the sport spread to numerous countries in the 1800s and 1900s. It was played in the Olympics as a [[Olympic sport|medal sport]] from 1992 to 2008. Other competitions between national teams include the [[Baseball World Cup]] and the [[World Baseball Classic]], which was first held in 2006.

== Origins ==
{{Further|Origins of baseball}}

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. A [[Medieval French literature|French]] manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly ''[[la soule]]'', with similarities to baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Other old French games such as ''thèque'', ''la balle au bâton'', and ''la balle empoisonnée'' also appear to be related.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 71–72, 75, 89, 147–149, 150, 160, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game [[rounders]], popular in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. ''[[Baseball Before We Knew It]]: A Search for the Roots of the Game'' (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of [[stoolball]] and "tut-ball".&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 86, 87, 111–113, 118–121, 135–138, 144, 160; Rader (2008), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; It has long been believed that [[cricket]] also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mason, Chris|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7919429.stm|title=Cricket 'Was Invented in Belgium'|date=2009-03-02|accessdate=2009-03-03|publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302235755/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7919429.stm|archivedate=March 2, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', by [[John Newbery]]. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" and a [[woodcut]] that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 139, 140, 151, 164, 178, 179, et seq.; {{cite web|author=Hellier, Cathy|url=http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume2/june04/pocketbook.cfm|title=Mr. Newbery's Little Pretty Pocket-Book|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=Colonial Williamsburg Foundation}} See [[s:A Little Pretty Pocket-book/Base-Ball|Wikisource edition of ''A Little Pretty Pocket-Book'']].&lt;/ref&gt; Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in [[Surrey]], and featured the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why isn't baseball more popular in the UK?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23425907|accessdate=26 July 2013|work=BBC News|date=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on [[Easter Monday]] 1755 in [[Guildford]], Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/baseball/2799671/Major-League-Baseball-told-Your-sport-is-British-not-American.html|title=Major League Baseball Told: Your Sport Is British, Not American|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=2009-02-03|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was also brought to the United States by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town's new meeting house.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 58, 160, 300, 307, 310; {{cite web|author=Miller, Doug|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050802&amp;content_id=1154441&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Pittsfield: Small City, Big Baseball Town|date=August 2, 2005|accessdate=2009-02-03|publisher=Major League Baseball|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321043321/http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050802&amp;content_id=1154441&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|archivedate=March 21, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1796, a version of the game was well-known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, "''englische Base-ball''" involved a contest between two teams, in which "the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate." Only one out was required to retire a side.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 67–75, 181; Gutsmuths quoted: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as "[[town ball]]", though other names such as "round-ball" and "base-ball" were also used.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. 4–5, 11–15, 25, 33, 59–61, et. seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to ''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' magazine—took place in [[South-West Oxford#Communities|Beachville, Ontario]], in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or ''byes''); first bye just {{convert|18|ft|m|}} from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doubleday myth|once widely accepted story]] that [[Abner Doubleday]] invented baseball in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), pp. xiv–xix, 15–18, 32–38, 42–47, et seq.; Rader (2008), pp. 7, 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Cartwright, photograph by J. J. Williams (PP-69-3-005).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Alexander Cartwright, father of modern baseball]]

In 1845, [[Alexander Cartwright]], a member of New York City's [[Knickerbocker Club]], produced a code of baseball rules now called the [[Knickerbocker Rules]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of "soaking" or "plugging"—effecting a [[putout]] by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Block (2005), p. 84; Koppett (2004), p. 2; Rader (2008), p. 8; Sullivan (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are reports that the [[New York Knickerbockers]] played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]: the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 32, 80, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (2000), pp. 8–14; Rader (2008), pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional leagues develop ===
In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the [[New York metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national game."&lt;ref&gt;Tygiel (2000), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing body, the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. In 1863, the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a [[fair ball]] on the first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by [[African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 27; Sullivan (1997), pp. 68, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 43, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The first professional league, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute [[National Association as a major league|its status as a major league]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 83–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more formally structured [[National League]] was founded in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes referred to as the "senior circuit."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 83, 130, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other major leagues formed and failed.

A modicum of peace was eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's [[minor league baseball|minor professional leagues]].&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 110; Zimbalist (2006), p. 22. See {{cite web|title=National Agreement for the Government of Professional Base Ball Clubs|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|publisher=roadsidephotos.sabr.org|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Series]], pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]] of the American League defeated the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] of the National League.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], under [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), pp. 141–150; Sullivan (1998), pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues' annual championship event.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As professional baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted [[strike action|strikes]], which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the [[reserve clause]], which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check.&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 56, 100, 102, 103, 113, 143, 147, 170, et seq.; Powers (2003), pp. 17–21, 27, 83, 121, 122, 160–164, 177; Rader (2008), pp. 60–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner [[Charles Comiskey]] and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] conspired to [[match fixing|throw]] the [[1919 World Series]]. The [[Black Sox Scandal]] led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 39, 47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Commissioner of Baseball|major league baseball commissioner]], [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the [[Negro National League (1920–1931)|Negro National League]]; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the [[Eastern Colored League]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), pp. 117, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise of Ruth and racial integration ===
[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Babe Ruth]] in 1920, the year he joined the [[New York Yankees]]]]
Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers, including stars [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Christy Mathewson]], were more dominant. The "[[Inside Baseball (strategy)|inside game]]", which demanded that players "scratch for runs", was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent [[Ty Cobb]] epitomized this style.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (1997), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[dead-ball era]] ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the [[spitball]] and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, followed the death of [[Ray Chapman]] after a pitch struck him in the head in August 1920. Coupled with superior materials available after World War I, this resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of reducing the distance to the outfield fences, making [[home run]]s more common.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the legendary player [[Babe Ruth]], the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the [[New York Yankees]], built a reputation as the majors' premier team.&lt;ref&gt;Zoss (2004), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] invested in several [[minor league baseball|minor league clubs]] and developed the first modern "[[farm team|farm system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Burk (2001), pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Negro National League (1933–1948)|Negro National League]] was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the [[Negro American League]]. The [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first elections]] to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] took place in 1936. In 1939 [[Little League Baseball]] was founded in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for [[Amateur baseball in the United States|children's baseball leagues]] across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp|title=History of Little League|accessdate=2007-06-26|publisher=Little League|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514082459/http://www.littleleague.org/about/history.asp|archivedate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With America's entry into World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. [[Chicago Cubs]] owner [[Philip K. Wrigley]] led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye – the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] existed from 1943 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/pages/league/12/league-history|title=League History|author=Lesko, Jeneane|year=2005|publisher=All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724213445/http://aagpbl.org/index.cfm/pages/league/12/league-history|archivedate=July 24, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-01-29|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural [[College World Series]] was held in 1947, and the [[Babe Ruth League]] youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: [[Jackie Robinson]] was signed by the National League's [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league [[Montreal Royals|team in Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; [[Larry Doby]] debuted with the American League's [[Cleveland Indians]] later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), pp. 180, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born [[Chico Carrasquel]] and black Cuban-born [[Minnie Miñoso]], became the first Hispanic [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Stars]].&lt;ref name="P111"&gt;Powers (2003), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3DD113FF935A15753C1A9639C8B63|title=Baseball: White Sox and Fans Speak Same Language, with a Spanish Accent|date=October 26, 2005|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing competition as varied as television and [[American football|football]], baseball attendance at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), p. 3; Bjarkman (2005), p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simm"&gt;Simmons, Rob, "The Demand for Spectator Sports", in ''Handbook on the Economics of Sport'', ed. Wladimir Andreff and Stefan Szymanski (Edward Elgar, 2006), pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racial integration|Integration]] proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.&lt;ref name="P111" /&gt; That year, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] was founded. It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective for years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; No major league team had been located west of [[St. Louis]] until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Burgos (2007), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The majors' final all-white bastion, the [[Boston Red Sox]], added a black player in 1959.&lt;ref name="P111"/&gt; With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the last Negro league folded the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Heaphy (2003), pp. 121, 218–224.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the American League reached the West Coast with the [[Los Angeles Angels]] [[expansion team]], and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally helped [[Roger Maris]] break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), pp. 307, 308; Sullivan (2002), pp. 163, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams.&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2012), pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attendance records and the age of steroids ===
[[File:D7K 4969 Roy Halladay.jpg|thumb|In May 2010, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' [[Roy Halladay]] pitched the 20th major league [[perfect game]]. That October, he pitched only the second [[no-hitter]] in MLB postseason history.]]

The players' union became bolder under the leadership of former [[United Steelworkers]] chief economist and negotiator [[Marvin Miller]], who was elected executive director in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 170, 172–175.&lt;/ref&gt; On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, the [[strike zone]] was reduced and the height of the [[pitcher's mound]] was lowered from 15 to 10 inches (38.1 - 25.4&amp;nbsp;cm). In 1969, both the National and American Leagues added two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted. Also that same year, [[Curt Flood]] of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major leagues' [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|first general players' strike]] took place in 1972, delaying the season's start for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 156–168, 175, 176.&lt;/ref&gt; In another effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the [[designated hitter]] rule the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (2002), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was [[Seitz decision|effectively struck down]], leading to the [[free agent|free agency system]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 178, 180, 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages occurred again in [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|1981]] and [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994]], the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 184–187, 191, 192, 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.&lt;ref name="Simm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), pp. 376, 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 1994 season.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 249, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season [[interleague play]] was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set.&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, [[Mark McGwire]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|both surpassed]] Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).&lt;ref&gt;Koppett (2004), p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Barry Bonds]] established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by [[Banned substances in baseball|the abuse of illegal steroids]] (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271; Zimbalist (2007), pp. 195, 196; {{cite news|author=Verducci, Tom|title=To Cheat or Not to Cheat|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/magazine/05/29/baseball.steroids/index.html?|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=May 29, 2012|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing [[Hank Aaron]], as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.&lt;ref name="MajorAtRec"&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Regular-Season Attendance Just Shy of Last Year's Record|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/124427|work=Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Daily|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MinorAtRec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minor League Baseball History|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|publisher=Minor League Baseball|accessdate=2009-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120173052/http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/history/|archivedate=January 20, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher [[Roger Clemens]]—have been implicated in the [[steroid era|steroid abuse scandal]], their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (2003), pp. 292–293; Rader (2008), pp. 254, 271, 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hilgers, Laura|title=Youth Sports Drawing More than Ever|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/07/03/rise.kids.sports/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the "Year of the Pitcher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Drellich, Evan|title=Year of the Pitcher Extends to Postseason|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101006&amp;content_id=15461864&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=Major League Baseball|date=October 6, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031041829/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20101006&amp;content_id=15461864&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|archivedate=31 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}} {{cite news|author=Gregory, Sean|title=Giants Win World Series: Year of the Pitcher Ends with a Fitting Duel|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/11/02/giants-win-world-series-year-of-the-pitcher-ends-with-a-fitting-duel/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 2, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107215049/http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/11/02/giants-win-world-series-year-of-the-pitcher-ends-with-a-fitting-duel/|archivedate=7 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Speier, Alex|title=Year of the Pitcher, or Year of the Umpire?|url=http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/alex-speier/2010/10/08/year-pitcher-or-year-umpire|publisher=WEEI|date=October 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017135536/http://www.weei.com/sports/boston/baseball/red-sox/alex-speier/2010/10/08/year-pitcher-or-year-umpire|archivedate=October 17, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball, widely known as America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players|International Association]], featured teams from both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), p. 73; Burk (2001), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada: Baseball participation, popularity rising across the nation|publisher=World Baseball Softball Confederation|date=October 12, 2016|url=http://www.wbsc.org/canada-baseball-participation-popularity-rising-across-the-nation/|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Flaherty, David H.|editor2=Manning, Frank E.|title=The Beaver Bites Back?: American Popular Culture in Canada|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1993|pages=157–158|isbn=9780773511200}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the [[Montreal Expos]] joined the National League as an expansion team.

In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at [[Parque Los Berros]] in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]].

In Asia, [[South Korea]] (1982), [[Taiwan]] (1990) and [[China]] (2003) all have professional leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. 362, 368; Gmelch (2006), pp. 100, 75, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, other than the [[Honkbal Hoofdklasse|Dutch league]], being the [[Serie A1 (baseball)|Italian league]] founded in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Bjarkman (2004), pp. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the [[2004 Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. The [[Israel Baseball League]], launched in 2007, folded after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mayo, Jonathan|title=Perspective: Baseball in the Holy Land|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090127&amp;content_id=501366&amp;vkey=news_milb&amp;fext=.jsp|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=January 28, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131063101/http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090127&amp;content_id=501366&amp;vkey=news_milb&amp;fext=.jsp|archivedate=January 31, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads.

After being admitted to the Olympics as a [[Olympic sport|medal sport]] beginning with the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Games]], baseball was dropped from the [[2012 Summer Olympic Games]] at the 2005 [[International Olympic Committee]] [[117th IOC Session|meeting]]. It remained part of the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games|2008 Games]]. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fewer Sports for London Olympics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4658925.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=July 8, 2005|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the [[National Hockey League]] now does during the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

Due to the longevity of the [[Indianapolis 500]], numerous traditions surrounding the race have developed over the years. Traditions include procedures for the running of the race, scheduling, and pre-race and post-race festivities. For many fans, these traditions are an important aspect of the race, and they have often reacted quite negatively when the traditions are changed or broken.

As part of the [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend, the pre-race ceremonies of the Indianapolis 500 feature several patriotic songs. Like most other sporting events, the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] is performed before the race by a notable vocalist. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the annual singing of "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]," and the victory lane bottle of [[milk]].

== Month of May ==
The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as "the month of May [at Indianapolis]". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. The policy was typically to make the track available for practice no later than May 1, although in most years, few if any competitors would be on the grounds yet. In some years, the track would be available for practice and testing as early as April. For instance, in 1932, cars began to arrive on April 6, and in 1969, the first day of practice was April 28. In very early years, it was not uncommon for the track to be closed on Sunday during practice, or be open for only competitors with the gates were closed to the public. In 1974, due to the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis]], the schedule was reduced, and the track opened instead three weeks before race day. The change was well-received, and the new schedule was made permanent, with various tweaks over the years.

In [[2014 IndyCar Series season|2014]], a [[IndyCar Grand Prix|second race at Indianapolis]] was introduced to the IndyCar Series schedule, conducted on the track's road course. The new event is held two weeks before the 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavin|first=Curt|title=IndyCar officials provide details for revised 2.434-mile IMS road course|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20131001/SPORTS0107/310010048/IndyCar-officials-provide-details-revised-2-434-mile-IMS-road-course|work=Indianapolis Star|publisher=Gannett Company|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though not part of the month of May, since the mid-2010s, '''Founders Day''' has been recognized and celebrated at the Speedway each year on March 20. That coincides with the date in 1909 in which the Speedway was incorporated. Since 2017, Founders Day is the date in which inductees to the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]] are announced.

===Memorial Day===
The race has always been scheduled in conjunction with [[Memorial Day]]. Through 1970, the race was held on Memorial Day proper (May 30), regardless of the day of the week, unless it fell on Sunday. In those cases it was scheduled for Monday May 31. After the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]] took effect in 1971, the race was scheduled as part of the [[Long weekend|three-day]] Memorial Day weekend - either the Saturday, the Sunday, or the Monday of the holiday weekend. Since 1974, the race has been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and has been held on a Sunday with only two exceptions due to rain delays.

Sundays were [[Blue laws in the United States|avoided]] for scheduling race activity dating all the way back to pre-500 races in 1909 and 1910. In early decades, Sundays were occasionally used for practice and/or qualifying, but were used sparingly in pre-World War II years. In some early years, practice may have been permitted on Sundays, but the gates might not be open to the public. When [[Tony Hulman]] bought the Speedway after World War II, Speedway management continued to refuse to schedule the race on a Sunday, a policy that stayed in place through 1973. Qualifying and practice, however, were regularly held on Sundays during those years, with no days closed to spectators.
*From 1911 to 1970, the race was scheduled for May 30, regardless of the day of the week. If May 30 fell on a Sunday, the race was scheduled for Monday May 31.
**For the first 500 in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]], May 30 fell on a Tuesday.
**In [[1915 Indianapolis 500|1915]], May 30 fell on a Sunday, and the race was initially scheduled for Saturday May 29. Heavy rains fell in the days leading up to the race flooding the grounds and made some roads leading to the track impassible. A few days before the race was to be held, officials decided to postpone the race until Monday May 31 in order to allow time for the grounds to dry out.
**The final race under that scheduling format (1970) happened to fall on a Saturday.
*In 1971 and 1972, the race was scheduled for the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. 
*In 1973, the race was scheduled for Memorial Day Monday. However, rain delayed it until Wednesday.
*Since 1974, the race has been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.
*In case of a rainout on Sunday, the race will be rescheduled for the following day, Monday - the Memorial Day federal holiday. Monday is the prioritized make-up date, however, if it rains again on Monday, the race will be shifted to the next available day. 
*The [[1986 Indianapolis 500|1986 race]] was scheduled for Sunday May 25, but was it rained out on both Sunday, and Monday. It was postponed to the following weekend, and held on Saturday May 31.
*The [[1997 Indianapolis 500|1997 race]] was scheduled for Sunday May 25, but rain washed out the day. The race began the next day, on Memorial Day (Monday May 26), but rain showers moved back into the area. The race was halted after 15 laps, and could not be restarted. Short of the 101 laps needed for an official race, track officials elected to resume the race on the following day (Tuesday May 27). The race was run to completion, as laps 16–200 were completed on Tuesday.

[[Armed Forces Day#United States|Armed Forces Day]] also falls during the month of May, and usually coincides with one of the weekends of time trials. Since 1978 at the Speedway, that weekend is often filled with activities honoring the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]], including an [[United States Armed Forces oath of enlistment|oath of enlistment ceremony]].

===Practice and qualifying===
[[Image:Castroneves Pole 20070512.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hélio Castroneves]] makes his pole-winning qualification run in [[2007 Indianapolis 500|2007]] during "Happy Hour". Note the shadows cast on the racing surface.]]

* '''Opening Day:''' The first day of practice is traditionally referred to as "Opening Day." From 1911 to 1973, Opening day was traditionally May 1st, although oftentimes the track was made available for practice much earlier than that date. Since 1974, the "Opening Day" practice session has been scheduled either three weeks or two weeks prior to race day. The day is usually marked with festivities and for many years was popularly attended. The battle to be the ''First Driver on the Track'' for the month was a spectacle of Opening Day for many years. Teams and drivers would battle to get their cars prepped and cranked up as soon as officials opened the track, hoping to be the first car to leave the pits, and likewise the first car to complete a lap for the month. The effort usually attracted the attention of the smaller teams, as it was seen as a way to draw headlines for the day. The race to be first on the track was usually friendly, although in some years it became heated, drawing the ire of the officials. For a time, it became a tradition that the cars of the Bryant Heating &amp; Cooling Team, and later [[Dick Simon Racing]], were usually the first cars on the track. In recent years, Opening Day might include separate sessions for Rookie Orientation and Refresher tests, proceeding or following a full-field, veteran driver practice session. One of the long-standing traditions of Opening Day is the ceremonial handing over of the keys to the [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]] from the manufacturer to the track officials.

*'''Rookie Orientation Program:''' Starting in [[1936 Indianapolis 500|1936]] all rookies were required to take a rookie test prior to being allowed to compete. The test traditionally consists of multiple phases, each increasing in speed, under the close observation of officials, driver coaches, and both current and former IndyCar Series drivers. Rookie drivers are required to exhibit adequate car control and proper driving lines, among other requirements. After several decades of conducting the tests during normal session of practice (usually early in the month), officials decided to organize the sessions. Since [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981]], the Rookie Orientation Program (ROP) has been held in April or early May. The program allows newcomers the opportunity to take their first laps at the Speedway and acclimate themselves to the circuit in a relaxed environment. It would be held without the pressure of veteran drivers crowding the track, without the distraction of spectators, and with minimal media coverage. Currently, drivers can complete all phases of their rookie tests during ROP if conditions allow. The ROP has traditionally been held prior to opening day, however, in some years it served as opening day. Drivers with exceptional driving experience at high levels of motorsports can occasionally receive waivers for participation in ROP, but must still pass their rookie test at a later date before they can practice during normal sessions. 

*'''Refresher Tests:''' In addition to Rookie Orientation Program, veteran Indy 500 drivers who have not been behind the wheel of a race car for a considerable amount of time, as determined by the officials, may be required to complete a refresher test prior to competing. The "Refresher Test" typically consists of the latter two phases of the rookie test, and is used to re-acclimate drivers to Indy car racing and the Speedway. Refresher test participants usually are drivers that have not driven in an Indy car, particularly on a superspeedway, since the previous year's Indy 500 (or longer). This usually applies to part-time drivers and drivers who have been away from the sport for an extended period of time. Full-time drivers in the IndyCar Series (that are not rookies) are almost universally exempt from taking refresher tests. Track time for refresher tests is usually offered during the Rookie Orientation Program, but they can also be completed on regular practice days.  Currently, the final two phases of the rookie tests are required for the Refresher test.

*'''Practice:''' Since the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911, the track has been opened for practice early in the month for competitors. Through 1973, it was a tradition that the track was made available for practice beginning on May 1. In some years the track opened as early as mid-April. In 1974, the schedule was cut back to three weeks prior to race day. Since 2010, the track typically opens for practice about two weeks before race day. In the early years, practice began each day as early as 9:00 a.m., but in modern times, the track typically opens at 11 a.m. or 12 p.m. Traditionally, the track closes at 6:00 p.m. 

* '''Happy Hour:''' The final hour of practice and qualifying each day is referred to as "[[Happy Hour]]". Due to the large double-deck grandstands on the frontstretch, large shadows are cast over a good portion of the track, cooling the asphalt surface. A lower ambient air temperature, along with a lower track surface temperature, usually translates into faster speeds. Since Indiana began observing [[Daylight Saving Time]] in 2006, this phenomenon has been somewhat diminished.

* '''Fast Friday:''' The final practice session before pole day qualifying is nicknamed "Fast Friday". The fastest speeds of the month are commonly observed on Fast Friday, as teams and drivers make their final preparations and look for final "bragging rights" before the run for the pole position. Since the current engine formula was adopted in 2012, elevated [[turbocharger]] "[[Turbocharger#Pressure increase / boost|boost]]" levels have been permitted on Fast Friday, reflecting the increased level allowed during time trials. Drivers who have been "[[Sandbagging (racing)|sandbagging]]" during the week may chose to reveal their speed, in an effort to distance themselves from the competition. Sometimes the speeds turned in on Fast Friday are overachieved by the respective drivers' due to [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|a tow]]. Though "Fast Friday" has been a fixture since the 1950s–1960s, the nickname was not coined until about 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url =http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=5296&amp;FS=INDYCAR| title =Indianapolis practice notes 96–05–10| publisher =Motorsport.com| date = 1996-05-10| accessdate = 2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Track records set on Fast Friday (as well as other practice sessions) are considered unofficial. The sanctioning body only recognizes speeds set during the officially competitive sessions of qualifying and the race.

* '''Pole Day:''' The first day of time trials traditionally was referred to as "[[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters|Pole Day]]." The fastest qualifier on pole day wins the highly coveted [[pole position]]. Over the years, the "race for the pole" was often regarded as a race in itself, a speed contest, and was ''advertised as'' the second-largest single day sporting event (second only to race day itself). Though crowds have diminished for pole day as of late, and rules changes have curtailed speeds, the nickname "The Fastest Day in Motorsports" is still sometimes used. Since 2014, a special two-day format has been utilized for time trials, and the pole position is actually not determined until the conclusion of the second day. The term "pole day" is still widely used, however, it is now being used to reference the second day in particular. 

* '''Bump Day:''' The final day of qualifying, when the final starting field is set, was traditionally known as "Bump Day" (or "Bubble Day"). Drivers who are removed from the starting grid of 33 by being out-qualified by faster cars are said to have been "bumped." The driver with the slowest speed in the field of 33, the first in line to be bumped, is said to be "on the bubble."&lt;ref name="Evolved"&gt;Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=3569 Indianapolis 500 Qualifying Has Evolved Over The Years], Indy500.com, September 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Unqualified drivers attempt to bump their way into the field and "burst the slower driver's bubble." Prior to World War II, the term typically used for drivers being knocked out of the field was "crowded out." Since the early 2000s, smaller entry lists have led to fewer cars, or even zero cars, being bumped from the starting grid. With the adoption of the special two-day qualifying format in 2014, the bumping procedure, if it occurs, actually would occur on the first day (Saturday) of time trials. As such, the term "Bump Day" disappeared from use for a few years. In 2018, the term "Bump Day" was brought back, and widely used as the nickname for the first day of time trials. 

*'''Post-qualifying practice''': Beginning in 2014, an additional practice session has been scheduled on the Monday after qualifying. After schedule overhauls, as well as a substantial format changes for qualifying, this 3{{frac|1|2}} hour session is utilized specifically for race practice, particularly multi-car "group" practice. Previously teams would utilize weekdays, and very often, loosely utilize the down times of the final day of time trials for such practice. Due to the format changes of time trials, adequate time is no longer available to practice during down times on the last day of time trials due to the lengthy post-qualifying technical inspection, and the general lateness of the day that the starting grid is finalized. This extra practice period is also sometimes used by teams to reach maximum mileage for engines, as they install a fresh engine for Carb Day and race day.  Under current INDYCAR rules, an engine must reach 2,550 miles (or 4,100 km) during the season in order to be eligible for a fresh engine.

*'''Indy Lights''': * The [[Indy Lights]] series began holding a support race, the [[Freedom 100]], during the month of May in 2003. For the first two years, it was held on the second weekend of time trials. In 2005, it was moved to Carb Day. The first practice, since 2014 changes, is held on the Monday of post-qualifying practice shortly after the finish of the 3 1/2 hour session for the IndyCar Series.  The second practice and time trials are held on Thursday, the day before Carb Day. IndyCar teams are not permitted to practice on Tuesday through Thursday, however, they may conduct pit stop practice. In addition, the time is spent setting up their respective pit areas.

* '''Carb Day:''' The final practice session before the race, currently held on the Friday before race day, is called "Carburetion Day" (shortened to "Carb Day" since 2000). The name originally came from the fact that it was the final session where teams could tune their [[carburetors]] in conditions similar to those that might be encountered on race day. The name has remained despite the fact that no qualified car has used a carburetor since 1963.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; The day is now similar to most motorsport weekends, as the final practice is accompanied by the a [[Pit Stop Challenge|pit stop contest]], a [[Card (sports)|support race]], and a concert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indy500.com/schedule/ Indianapolis 500 Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144337/http://www.indy500.com/schedule/ |date=2008-10-13 }}, Indy500.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pit Stop Challenge]] debuted in 1977, the [[Indy Lights]] [[Freedom 100]] moved to Carb Day in 2005, and the concerts have been held since 1998. In 1969–1972, Carb Day was held the Wednesday before the race. From 1973 to 2004, Carb Day was held the Thursday before the race. It was moved to Friday before the race beginning in 2005, at which time the Indy Lights race was moved to that day. Prior to 1969, Carb Day was not on a fixed day of the week, instead it was simply scheduled for a nondescript day midway between the final day of time trials and race day, and was sometimes closed to the public.

===Radio===
The longtime flagship of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]] is [[WFNI]] AM 1070 (formerly [[WIBC (FM)|1070 WIBC]]). The network dates back to 1952, and was initially launched using WIBC talent. Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, the station has featured extensive daily coverage of practice, qualifications, as well as pre-race and post-race coverage on race day.

Since 1971, the most popular and most traditional daily show during the month of May has been Donald Davidson's ''[[Donald Davidson (historian)#The Talk of Gasoline Alley|The Talk of Gasoline Alley]]''.&lt;ref name="One on One"&gt;{{cite episode|title=May 10, 2009 |series=One on One With Mark Montieth |url=http://www.1070thefan.com/oneonone/ |network=[[WFNI]] |airdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717160855/http://www.1070thefan.com/oneonone/ |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerts===
[[File:Jasonaldean.jpg|thumb|[[Jason Aldean]]]]
Since 1998, a concert featuring a top act(s) have been held the weekend of the race. Numerous other local bands, [[Indie rock|indie bands]], [[Garage rock|garage bands]], and smaller musical acts perform at other times during the month on days featuring track activity. Since 1998, a headlining concert has been held on Carb Day. Starting in 2014, a second headlining concert has been held on Legends Day. The Carb Day concert has typically featured [[Rock music|rock groups]], while Legends Day typically stars [[country music]] artists.

===Last Row Party===
[[File:FelipeGiaffone2005Indy500.jpg|thumb|Driver [[Felipe Giaffone]] wearing his "Last Row Party" jacket at the [[2005 Indianapolis 500|2005 race]].]]
A few days before the race, the "Last Row Party" has been held for charity since 1972. It is a scholarship benefit organized by the Indianapolis Press Club Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indypressfoundation.org/last-row-party|title=Indianapolis Press Club Foundation|website=Indianapolis Press Club Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually held the Thursday evening or Friday evening before the race. Currently it is held at one of the suites in the Pagoda, and previously it was held at the Speedway Motel. The event is conducted as a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] and [[cocktail party]] for the final three qualifiers in the 500, who will be starting on the eleventh and final row (positions 31, 32, and 33). Due to the complex [[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters#Qualifying procedure|qualifying procedure]] for the race, these three drivers are usually, but not always, the slowest three cars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-ims-details-on-the-33rd-annual-last-row-party/|title='Last Row Part' Celebrates 33 Years of 11th-Row Merriment on May 27|publisher=Motorsport.com|work=IMS Press Release|first=Eric|last=Powell|date=April 22, 2005|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Mr. Irrelevant]], often some of these drivers are obscure, and several have been race rookies. Some are noted for a dramatic last-minute qualifying effort to secure a spot in the lineup, while others may have survived a Bump day scare, or an otherwise tumultuous month of May, to hold on to make the field. Nine former or eventual race winners have participated in the honor at some time during their career ([[Johnny Rutherford|Rutherford]], [[Gordon Johncock|Johncock]], [[Tom Sneva|Sneva]], [[Eddie Cheever|Cheever]], [[Buddy Lazier|Lazier]], [[Ryan Hunter-Reay|Hunter-Reay]], [[Tony Kanaan|Kanaan]], [[Takuma Sato|Sato]], [[Alexander Rossi|Rossi]]).

In addition to being on the receiving end of numerous good-natured jokes and jabs, the three drivers are presented with a special jacket, various gifts, and checks for 31[[Penny (United States coin)|¢]], 32¢, and 33¢, respectively. The group becomes known as the "11th Row Society", an enjoys a [[buffet]] dinner, [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]], [[cocktail]]s, and [[hors d'oeuvre]] with attendees. Later they may sign autographs and pose for pictures, in what is generally a fun and laid-back environment. The emcee for the event is usually a media figure, and past hosts include [[Bob Jenkins]], [[Robin Miller (journalist)|Robin Miller]], [[Jack Arute]], [[Dave Wilson (radio personality)|Dave Wilson]], and Laura Steele. The 2015 and 2016 co-emcees were Curt Cavin (''[[Indianapolis Star]]'') and Chris Hagen ([[WXIN]]). [[Lindy Thackston]] hosted the event for 2017 and 2018. The 2013 reception was not held but a brief ceremony was held on Carb Day to recognize the honorees.

Recent honorees include:
*2014: [[Sage Karam]], [[Sebastián Saavedra]], [[Buddy Lazier]]
*2015: [[Bryan Clauson]], [[Ryan Briscoe]], [[James Davison]]&lt;ref name="2015LastRow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/maymadness/last-row-party-best-insults/ |title=The Last Row Party’s Best Insults|publisher=Indianapolis Monthly|first=Hannah|last=Hall|date=May 22, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public drivers' meeting and Legends Day===

[[File:2012Indy500LegendsDay.jpg|thumb|150px|Legends Day in [[2012 Indianapolis 500|2012]]]]
The day before the race, a ceremonial drivers meeting is held at the track, which is open to the public, and is popularly attended. This tradition dates back many decades. During the meeting, the 33 starting drivers are presented with their starter's ring and various awards and trophies are handed out (such as trophies from the previous year's race, qualifying awards, lifetime achievement awards, etc.) The drivers are usually seated on a platform situated in the eleven rows of three, and numerous other celebrities and special guests may be honored or give remarks. Rules clarifications, instructions for the race, and other pertinent information is also discussed in the open forum. Drivers who can not attend due to scheduling conflicts (e.g., participating in another race) will usually have another team member or family member participate on their behalf.

This drivers meeting is separate from the official drivers meeting, organized by race stewards. That meeting, held the morning of the race, is strictly closed to the public and the media.

Starting in 1998, the days leading up to the race have included ceremonies and activities honoring former drivers. In some years, each day during the week would have a featured Indy legend, and might feature the driver taking ceremonial laps around the track in one of his winning race cars, or in a pace car. Other years utilized Opening Day as an opportunity to honor Indy legends. In addition, the day before the race was expanded to include an autograph session featuring the 33 starting drivers, former drivers, Q&amp;A sessions, car displays, a "fanfest" midway, a memorabilia show, and other festivities. Starting 2011, the events of the day before the race have been officially themed "Legends Day," and features a designated honoree. In addition, Legends Day showcases the classic cars of the 500: fans are able to get close looks and take photos of the machines, with a number of historic race cars also running laps of the circuit.

===500 Festival Parade===
[[File:Race to Indy!.jpg|thumb|The '''500 Festival Parade''' is one of the nation's largest, regularly drawing 300,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.500festival.com/parade/history|title=Parade history|author=500 Festival|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''500 Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.500festival.com/|title=500 Festival|author=|date=|work=500Festival.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1957 to organize various civic events in the city of [[Indianapolis]] leading up to the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.500festival.com/festival/ | title =Welcome to The 500 Festivalname|publisher =500Festival.com| access-date = April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest events are the [[OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon]] in early May, and the 500 Festival [[Parade]] the day before the race. Other events have included "Community Day" at the track, memorial services, luncheons, and the annual Snake Pit [[Ball (dance)|Ball]], a [[black tie]] [[socialite]] gathering downtown.

In many years, the parade grand marshal has been a celebrity with ties to Indiana or the Indianapolis area, particularly Indianapolis-area sports figures. In many cases, the grand marshal of the parade is also honored during pre-race festivities on race morning. The organizing committee boasts the parade as one of the largest in the nation. In 1997, a fire swept through the storage hangar housing the floats for that year's parade, threatening to cancel the event. Only four floats were spared, and [[Buddy Lazier]]'s [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 winning car]] escaped the fire only because the museum had decided to wait a few extra days before delivering it to the float staging area. The parade went on as scheduled, but in a slightly retooled format.&lt;ref name="Star05-22-1997a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenge at hand: saving the parade (part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9406953//|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 22, 1997|access-date=March 8, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star05-22-1997b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenge at hand: saving the parade (part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9406962//|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 22, 1997|access-date=March 8, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track lore==
[[File:Indy500GoldenBrick.JPG|thumb|250px|A ceremonial golden brick was installed at the start/finish line of the track to commemorate the 100th anniversary]]
[[File:GASOLINEALLEY1984.jpg|thumb|right|Gasoline Alley in 1984.]]
[[File:GASOLINEALLEY1993.jpg|thumb|right|The new Gasoline Alley opened in 1986.]]
The atmosphere at the track during the month of May and on race day has long been a source of traditions.
===The Brickyard===
The nickname of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the "Brickyard." When the track opened in August 1909, the surface was composed of crushed stone and tar. This surface quickly was deemed unsuitable and dangerous after multiple accidents. In the fall of 1909, the track was paved in brick. In just over two months, 3.2&amp;nbsp;million bricks were hand laid on a bed of sand and the gaps were filled with mortar. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track the "Brickyard".&lt;ref name="IMShistory1"&gt;{{cite web|title=IMS Milestones: 1906–1911 – Indianapolis Motor Speedway|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/history/35207-1906-1911-Milestones|publisher=Indianapolismotorspeedway.com|date=March 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510020733/http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/history/35207-1906-1911-Milestones/|archivedate=May 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, portions of the track were paved over in asphalt. By the late 1950s, only a portion of the mainstretch remained brick.

Following the 1961 race, the remaining part of the mainstretch was paved over, and the entire track was now covered in asphalt. One yard of bricks was left exposed at the start/finish line. The vast majority of the original 3.2&amp;nbsp;million bricks remain in place, several inches underneath the asphalt. Some bricks have been unearthed from the track over the years, namely in the locations where the infield access tunnels have been constructed. Subsequent repavings of the track in 1976, 1988, 1995, and 2004, have also kept the bricks in place underneath. However, the yard of bricks exposed at the start/finish line has been dug up in those instances, and different bricks - ostensibly bricks that were dug up at one point from other parts of the track - were cleanly laid in place.

In 2000 when the new Pagoda and Pagoda Plaza were built, the yard of bricks was extended from the track surface across the pit lane and then through to the spectator areas in the new Pagoda Plaza.

===Gasoline Alley===
The garage area at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is known as "Gasoline Alley." The nickname dates back to the early decades of the race, and for a time, referred specifically to one particular spot in the back where cars would refuel. Though the exact origin of the name is unclear, it may be loosely linked to the eponymous [[Gasoline Alley|comic strip]]. Later, the nickname was used for the main corridor of the garage area, and eventually was used colloquially for the entire garage complex. The use of [[gasoline]] at the Indy 500 was phased out in favor of [[methanol]] beginning in [[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]] (and later [[ethanol]] in [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]]), but the nickname nonetheless remained. Gasoline was not used again at Indy until [[NASCAR]] arrived for the [[Brickyard 400]] in [[1994 Brickyard 400|1994]].

The first garage area consisted of one double-sided bank of garages running east-west. It was in the same general location as the present day complex. In the very early years, the foreign entries were housed in a second garage complex outside of turn two. In 1929, a second row of garages was constructed alongside the first, creating the soon-to-be familiar Gasoline Alley corridor. The original garages were known for their signature green and white barn doors, and were sometimes visually compared to [[horse]] [[Stable|stables]], as the complex loosely resembled a [[horse racing]] [[paddock]].

One of the fixtures of the garage area was Tom Bealle's [[diner]], an outdoor [[restaurant]] and [[gathering place]], popular with drivers, mechanics, officials, and fans. Bealle often allowed drivers to run up a tab during the month of May, allowing them to pay their bill once they received their prize money at the end of the month.

A fire swept through the garage area on the morning of the [[1941 Indianapolis 500|1941 race]], and burned down a significant portion of the south bank of garages. They were replaced, and eventually the complex expanded to 88 stalls. As the sport grew, and the cars and teams became larger and more sophisticated, work space was increasingly limited in the garages. Amenities were simple, corridors were heavily congested, and by the 1980s, the cars and teams had outgrown the aging facility. 

Despite their lack of modern amenities, the garages had a nostalgic quaintness admired by participants and fans, and they also served important intrinsic purposes for the teams. For many years, the entry fee for the Indianapolis 500 provided a garage stall to the competitors not just for the month of May, but for the entire offseason as well.&lt;ref name="Star08-09-1985a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway's new 96 garages will accent spaciousness (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14338545/gasoline_alley_1985/|first=Jep|last=Cadou Jr.|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 9, 1985|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star08-09-1985b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway's new 96 garages will accent spaciousness (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14338719/gasoline_alley_1985/|first=Jep|last=Cadou Jr.|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=8|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 9, 1985|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a valuable asset to some teams, especially small-budget teams without a large [[Workshop|race shop]]. Even larger, more established teams still might use the garage stall for storage or as a staging location for cross-country trips to other races.

Following the [[1985 Indianapolis 500|1985 race]], the original Gasoline Alley garage area was [[1986 Indianapolis 500#Garage area|torn down and replaced]] with a [[state-of-the-art]], multimillion dollar garage complex. The nickname "Gasoline Alley" remained when the new complex opened in [[1986 Indianapolis 500|1986]]. In 2000, an additional row of garages was constructed alongside the pit lane on the main stretch, in preparations for the [[United States Grand Prix#Indianapolis (2000–2007)|U.S. Grand Prix]]. Although the pitside garages are used during the [[Brickyard 400]] for NASCAR inspection and top Cup Series teams (lower teams and the Xfinity Series teams use Gasoline Alley), they are specifically not considered part of Gasoline Alley.

===The Snake Pit===
[[File:1988Indy500timetrials.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Turn 4 infield ("Snake Pit II") seen on pole day in 1988.]]
The [[infield]] of the track in the vicinity of turn one was known as the "Snake Pit." Long known for a reputation of rowdiness, [[Binge drinking|heavy alcohol consumption]], [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bikers]], [[streaking]], [[Exhibitionism|flashing]], and an overall [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]/[[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]-esque atmosphere, the Snake Pit was a popular location for college-age fans to spend time at the track, many of whom had little or no interest in the actual racing activities. Like the [[Kentucky Derby#Traditions|infield at the Kentucky Derby]], the Snake Pit was often considered a rite of spring, and an excuse to party with abandon. Arrests for [[public intoxication]], [[disorderly conduct]], [[Assault|fights]], and [[drug possession]] were frequent and common.

In periods of rain, the area usually became overwhelmed with mud, and [[mud wrestling]] was commonly observed. Bonfires and burned cars were also noted.

In 1980, a fatality occurred in the area after a [[Jeep]] flipped over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spectator killed, but Indy driver survives accident|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NuwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-TIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3898%2C3613086|newspaper=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=May 23, 1980|agency=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, track management decided to take steps to curtail the [[:wikt:revelry|revelry]]. For the 1981 race, [[bleachers]] were erected in the turn one infield. In addition, capital improvements that included the new Gasoline Alley, a place for competitors to park motor homes, new support buildings, new restroom buildings, and other changes to the site, gradually and deliberately scaled back the size of the area. As a result, for the better part of the 1980s, the patrons migrated to the infield of turn four, and the less-intense '''Snake Pit II''' emerged. By the 1990s, the intensity of the rowdiness had dropped substantially, due largely to third-generation management at the Speedway ([[Tony George]]) and beefed up law enforcement. By the end of the 20th century, it almost disappeared completely.

The turn four infield was razed in 1999 to make room for the infield road course. The race day party scene migrated again, this time to its current location, the turn three infield.&lt;ref name="Star05-16-2010pgb6"&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteers' jobs aren't ordinary|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18345581/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=B6|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 16, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Snake Pit eventually became more of a festive [[party]] zone. Later, the original turn one location was also razed to make room for road course modifications, a section sometimes referred to as the "Snake Pit" section. In 2010, the turn three infield was officially named the '''[New] Snake Pit''', and began to be organized and officially marketed by management.&lt;ref name="Star05-27-2010pgI18"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snake's Alive!

While rock music typically headlines the Carb Day concert, and country music headlines the Legends Day concert, [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] is featured at the Snake Pit. In the mid-2010s, the revelry in the Snake Pit has somewhat re-intensified, however, not to the levels witnessed in the 1970s and early 1980s.

===Coke Lot===
Similar to the aforementioned "Snake Pit," the Coke Lot which is located outside the track, is the most noteworthy and popular [[camping]] location on the grounds of the Speedway. Officially designated Lot 1C, it has been nicknamed the "[[Coca-Cola|Coke]] Lot" for decades due to the presence of a [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] [[Bottling company|bottling plant]] located on an adjacent property.

The lot is an open field situated just to the northwest of the track, outside of turn 4 of the oval, off of Georgetown Road. Long known for intense revelry and all-night partying (particularly on the night before the race), the Coke Lot is a festive area and party scene for [[Recreational vehicle|RVs]] and [[Travel trailer|campers]], as well as [[tent|tent campers]]. The lot typically opens a few days before the race and allows fans to stay through the entire race weekend.

While the Coke Lot is the most notorious camping area, several other camping lots are also situated around the vicinity of the Speedway, some focusing on family-friendly environments, while others are considered premium lot for high-end RV'ers.

In years past, another camping area called the "North 40" (named due to its size of approximately 40 [[acres]]) was another scene of intense overnight revelry. In the 1970s, its revelry surpassed that of the Coke Lot. Located directly north of the track off of 30th Street, in close proximity to the Speedway's golf course, and backed up against a neighborhood of homes, it is no longer used for camping. Currently it is only utilized for daytime car parking, and employee parking. During its peak, security had to begin using giant [[searchlight]]s to keep North 40 campers from illegally wandering onto the golf course property late into the night.

A traditional food of choice at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] is the [[pork tenderloin sandwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/news/3550/Party_At_Brickyard_Crossing_To_Feature_Food_Network_Show| title =Party At Brickyard Crossing To Feature Food Network Show| publisher =Indy500.com| date = 2004-09-14| accessdate = 2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Beer]] (largely [[Beer in the United States|domestic]]) is consumed in considerable amounts at the track. Unlike most sports stadiums and arenas, at Indianapolis (and most speedways), spectators are allowed to [[BYOB|bring their own alcoholic beverages]] into the track for consumption. Beer is also sold at concessions. Glass bottles, however, are strictly prohibited at the track. Broken glass is considered an extreme hazard to the race cars (cut tires) on the track.

[[Peanut]]s are considered bad luck. An ambiguous, long-standing [[superstition]] against eating peanuts at the race track has dominated Indianapolis dating back to at least the 1940s. Legend says, though unconfirmed, that a crashed car was found with peanut shells in the cockpit. As of 2009, however, peanuts are sold at trackside concessions, and the myth has lost a lot of its following.

From the mid-1960s until her death in 1975, Mary Catherine "Mom" Unser (mother of [[Jerry Unser|Jerry]], [[Bobby Unser|Bobby]], and [[Al Unser|Al]]) was a well-known fixture at the race. She became famous for her [[Chili con carne|spicy chili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/life/food/2014/05/01/mom-unsers-chili-hot-indy-tradition/8577767/|title=Mom Unser's chili: A hot Indy 500 tradition|publisher=IndyStar|first=Amanda|last=Bell|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, she would treat the participants to a cook-out in the garage area.

Several local restaurants, both current and former, have been popular gathering places for participants and fans during the month of May. Establishments include [[St. Elmo Steak House]], Charlie Brown's Pancake and Steak House, Mug-n-Bun Drive-in Restaurant, and Long's Bakery. The aforementioned Tom Bealle's diner was a fixture of the garage area for many years. Redevelopment of Main Street in [[Speedway, Indiana|Speedway]] has created a area of popular establishments and nightlife, including [[Sarah Fisher]]'s 1911 Grill, and [[A. J. Foyt]]'s Foyt Wine Vault. A [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] used to stand across the street from the track, as did a [[Steak 'n Shake]], but both have since been demolished. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Mate's White Front Tavern was a popular hangout for drivers and crews. Located just a few blocks east of the Speedway, it was sold to new management in the early 1960s, and was kept open until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Star05-23-2015a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Racers, cheap booze at White Front (part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9873450/|first=Will|last=Higgins|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=A3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star05-23-2015b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Racers, cheap booze at White Front (part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9873484/|first=Will|last=Higgins|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=A10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Taco Bell]] just east of the Speedway has gained subtle notoriety with fans after Indy drivers [[Scott Dixon]] and [[Dario Franchitti]] were mugged in the parking lot in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/sports/autoracing/scott-dixon-taco-bell-robbery.html|title=Scott Dixon Reflects on Fast-Food Robbery|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=23 May 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstitions===
[[File:Indy500PitStall12A.jpg|thumb|275px|In the pit area at Indianapolis, there is no pit stall #13. It is substituted with #12A.]]
Numerous [[superstition]]s have developed at the Indianapolis 500 over the years. Most date back many decades, although some have lost a considerable amount of following. Among the prevailing superstitions in the modern day include the ongoing "[[Andretti curse]]" and "Curse of the Smiths" (see below).

Older superstitions that have been popular at Indianapolis include some of the following:
*'''Number 13''': [[Triskaidekaphobia]] - fear of the use of the [[13 (number)|Number 13]] - has prevailed at Indianapolis dating back to the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first 500]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1951pg36"&gt;{{cite news|title=Freddy Agabashian Fights Hard Against "13 Jinx" Bad Omen Haunts California Driver|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19991579/indy_superstitions/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=36|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 30, 1951|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the car assigned 13 did not make the race. Only one driver carried #13 on their car for the remainder of the 20th century. In [[1914 Indianapolis 500|1914]], [[George Mason (racing driver)|George Mason]] started 13th and finished 23rd. From 1926 to 2002, the use of #13 was officially disallowed by the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Best By Number|publisher=[[Sporting News]]|year=2006|chapter=13 And Indy 500 Are Like Oil And Water|page=61|isbn=0-89204-848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most drivers avoided the use of number 13, however after changes in the rules, [[Greg Ray]] used the number in [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]]. It was only the second time the number 13 had been used over the first 87 editions of the race. Subsequently only two other drivers have used #13: [[E. J. Viso]] ([[2009 Indianapolis 500|2009]]) and [[Danica Patrick]] ([[2018 Indianapolis 500|2018]]). Both Viso and Patrick dropped out of the respective races.
*'''Green cars''': A long-time superstition at Indianapolis has been against painting cars the color [[green]].&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1951pg36"/&gt; Many drivers and team prefer not to allow the color green on their cars, even if just on small decals or pinstriping. Apropos to that, there have been two green winning cars ([[1920 Indianapolis 500|1920]] and [[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]]).
*'''Peanuts''': [[Peanuts]] are considered bad luck (see Food above). An ambiguous, long-standing superstition against eating peanuts at the race track has dominated Indianapolis dating back to at least the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1951pg36"/&gt;
*'''Miscellany''': Numerous other and sometimes ambiguous superstitions have been promulgated by a myriad of drivers. However, many have lost much if not all of their following. Some included not allowing women and children near the cars, entering and exiting the cockpit on a particular side, not allowing photographs prior to going out on the track, and carrying [[good luck charm]]s.

===Curse of the Smiths===
[[File:Mark Smith Long Beach Grand Prix 1993 Indy car race CART.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mark Smith (American racing driver)|Mark Smith]] failed to qualify.]]
Among the over [[:Category:Indianapolis 500 drivers|766 drivers]] who have participated in the Indy 500, none have had the last name [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], the most common surname in the United States. Several Smiths have attempted to make the race, the last being [[Mark Smith (American racing driver)|Mark Smith]] who failed to qualify in 1993 and 1994,&lt;ref&gt;Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/3747/_Curse_Of_The_Smiths__Remains_Part_Of_Indianapolis_500_Lore 'Curse Of The Smiths' Remains Part Of Indianapolis 500 Lore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625011350/http://www.indy500.com/news/3747/_Curse_Of_The_Smiths__Remains_Part_Of_Indianapolis_500_Lore |date=2009-06-25 }}, Indy500.com, November 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; despite finishing 5th at the Michigan Superspeedway in a 1994 CART race. By contrast there have been eight different drivers with the last name [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and four with the last name [[Johnson]].

Only two drivers with the surname Smith have ever competed in professional races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, albeit in different events. [[Regan Smith]] drove in the [[Brickyard 400]] from 2008 to 2013 (with a best finish of 3rd in 2011). He also has competed in the [[Lilly Diabetes 250]]. Motorcyclist [[Bradley Smith (motorcyclist)|Bradley Smith]] competed in the [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Red Bull Indianapolis GP]], with best finish of second in [[2009 Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|2009]].

A German language translation of Smith has participated, with [[Sam Schmidt]] making three starts.

===Rabbits===
A longstanding legend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway involves bunny [[rabbit]]s.&lt;ref name="News05-30-1959pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway Rabbit Finally Captured|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19100000/|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 30, 1959|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911-1993, there was only one race held annually at the Speedway. Activity outside the month of May was limited to semioccasional tire testing. Thus for eleven months out of the year, the grounds were noticeably quiet, green and lush, particularly after nine holes of a golf course were built in the spacious infield in 1929. The well-manicured grounds naturally became a home for [[fauna]], particularly rabbits and other small [[vermin]]. As the race participants would arrive in the spring, they would often be greeted by numerous rabbits roaming the grounds, oftentimes running out on the track. The rabbits were thought to be welcome and some considered them symbols of good luck. However, they were sometimes a nuisance, causing yellows for running out on the track and evading capture. [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]] famously ran over a rabbit during the [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988 race]].&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1988pg2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Even rabbit's foot can't help Unser|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19100378/|first=Rick|last=Shaffer|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=2|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 30, 1988|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known presence of rabbits at the Speedway even began a tradition that a rabbit would appear somewhere in the race program each year.

==Pre-race ceremonies==

[[File:Indy500MilitaryAppreciation.jpg|thumb|Military Appreciation Lap at the 2015 Indianapolis 500.]]
* At 6 a.m., and in some years as early as 5 a.m., an [[Salute (pyrotechnics)|aerial bomb]] is set off to signal the opening of the gates.
* At 8 a.m., the "Parade of Bands" marches around the racing circuit. Numerous [[marching band]]s from nearby and neighboring high schools and universities entertain the early arriving fans. This tradition dates back to 1922, and celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2015.&lt;ref name="Bands2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/news-multimedia/all/2015/01/26/indianapolis-500-parade-of-bands-90-anniversary?startrow=4|title=Indianapolis 500 Parade of Bands Recognized by Indianapolis House/Senate Resolution|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|first=Tom|last=Surber|date=January 26, 2015|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the bands in attendance also participate in the 500 Festival Parade downtown the day before. Traditional participants include the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]] (along with the [[Purdue Big Bass Drum|World's Largest Drum]] which is driven around the track) and [[Speedway Senior High School|Speedway High School]].
* The [[Purdue University]] [[Purdue All-American Marching Band|All-American Marching Band]] plays several pre-race songs, including "[[On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away|On the Banks of the Wabash]]" and "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]."
*In the 1960s to the 1990s, early arriving spectators would be entertained by [[Big band]] music. Songs by well-known Hoosier band leader George Freije and the Freije All Star Band were played over the public address system from roughly 6 a.m. to 8 a.m.&lt;ref name="Star05-26-1974pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Race Timetable|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19099606/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 26, 1974|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1991, and in most years since about 2002, a special military appreciation lap has been held. Military personnel who have recently returned from active service overseas are honored in a parade around the track. In 1991, hundred of troops who had returned from [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] marched around the course on race morning. In the 2000s, troops (namely from [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]) have been paraded around in trucks and saluted by fans.
* About an hour or two before the race, there is a parade around the track (typically in convertible festival cars) of the 500 [[Beauty pageant|Festival Queen]] and her court of 500 Festival Princesses. Likewise, a similar parade of former race winners, celebrities in attendance, and other VIPs is conducted.
* In many years, a ceremonial lap of vintage race cars and/or vintage pace cars is conducted. In some cases, the original drivers (or surviving relatives) are behind the wheel.
* Starting in 2016, a new tradition was introduced, the "march to the bricks." The [[Borg-Warner Trophy]] is paraded through the infield to the start/finish line.
* Finally, driver introductions take place. They are usually in reverse starting order with the front row being introduced last. This is followed by the drivers being paraded around the track similar to the Festival Queen, her court, and other VIPs.

The pre-race ceremonies usually go in the following order:
* Invocation
* "[[Taps]]"
* "[[America the Beautiful]]" and "[[God Bless America]]"
* "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]"
* "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]" accompanied by a balloon release
* Starting command

===Grand marshal===
In some years, a [[grand marshal]] has been named for the race. The duties of the grand marshal may include greeting drivers and dignitaries during pre-race ceremonies, delivering the "drivers to your cars" message, and riding in the pace car. This person may or may not be the same grand marshal as the 500 Festival Parade. Unlike other races, the grand marshal will not give the starting command.

*2015: [[Nastia Liukin]]
*2016: [[Florence Henderson]] (her final appearance)
*2018: [[Nick Goepper]]

===National anthem===
''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' has been performed before the start of the Indy 500 in most years. Up through the 1970s and early 1980s, the song was typically played by the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]] without a vocalist. However, in some rare occasions, a vocalist was used. In 1976, [[Tom Sullivan (singer)|Tom Sullivan]] and [[Up with People]] were invited to sing, as a gesture to the [[United States Bicentennial|U.S. Bicentennial]].

By the mid-1980s, the Speedway began inviting notable artists to perform the national anthem. In nearly all cases, they would be backed by the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band|Purdue Band]]. In 1983, James A. Hubert flubbed the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;1983 Indianapolis 500 Radio Broadcast, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; He omitted the line ''"O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?"'' and instead repeated the second line ''"What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming"'', stumbling on the word "twilight" the second time around.

After the national anthem is performed, the public address announcer or the grand marshal gives the command "Drivers, to your cars!"

In 2001, [[Steven Tyler]] of [[Aerosmith]] caused a controversy&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bruce. [http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12050217 Aerosmith's Steven Tyler Angers Vets At Indy 500], Yahoo! Music, May 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; after he [[2001 Indianapolis 500#National anthem controversy|changed the lyrics]] of the song. Recent performers include:

===Other songs===
In most years since 1991, the songs "[[America the Beautiful]]" and/or "[[God Bless America]]" have been performed. [[Florence Henderson]], a native Hoosier, was a friend of the Hulman-George family that owns the Speedway. Henderson performed one of the two songs numerous times, book-ending years when she performed the national anthem instead. Her performances were usually not televised.

The performance of "America the Beautiful" was introduced for the race's 75th anniversary running in 1991, in part due to [[Operation Desert Storm]]. Henderson switched to the national anthem for 1993–1997, then resumed "America the Beautiful" in 1999. In 2003, her performance was switched to "[[God Bless America]]," which became more popular in the post-9/11 era. She continued through 2015, then served as grand marshal for her final race in 2016. Henderson died six months after the 2016 race. Henderson routinely sang the entire song, including the prologue, and in some years sang the chorus a second time.

By 2009, "America the Beautiful" was re-added to the ceremonies, with a different artist each year. In 1999, [[Lee Greenwood]] did a special performance of "[[God Bless the USA]]", and in 2003, [[Darryl Worley]] performed "[[Have You Forgotten? (song)|Have You Forgotten?]]". In 2005, [[3 Doors Down]] did a special performance of [[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|"Kryptonite"]] from the Pagoda, as part of the driver introductions.

===Invocation===
Starting in 1974, the Indy 500 was moved to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. As a gesture, the Speedway added an [[invocation]] to the pre-race ceremonies. In most years since 1980, the Speedway has invited a representative of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis]]. In selected years, others have been invited including nationally famous clergymen [[Oral Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZHVhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-voDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4159,7848240&amp;dq=jim%20mckay%201975%20indianapolis&amp;hl=en|title=Lakeland Ledger – Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|work=Google.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Billy Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = | title = IRL: Indy 500 – Billy Graham to give Race Day Invocation | url = http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-indy-500-billy-graham-to-give-race-day-invocation/ | publisher = motorsport.com | access-date = November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Most Reverend]] [[Archbishop]] [[Edward Thomas O'Meara|Edward T. O'Meara]] participated several times until his death in early 1992. Archbishop [[Daniel M. Buechlein]] then took over as the traditional clergy starting in 1993. Buechlein customarily ended his invocation with the word "[[wikt:Godspeed|Godspeed]]" in the languages of all of the participating drivers. Buechlein's final year at the race was 2009, and he died in 2018 after a lengthy illness.

===Taps===
In remembrance of [[Memorial Day]], "[[Taps]]" is played, and a U.S. military aircraft does a [[Flypast|fly-by]]. In some years, multiple aircraft participate, executing the [[missing man formation]]. Traditionally, a member of the public address announcing team recited a [[preamble]] honoring those who have died in combat, and [[List of racing drivers who died in racing crashes|those who have perished in automobile racing]]. The preamble dated back to at least 1965. Jim Philippe recited the preamble until he died in 2003. Dave Calabro said it in 2006, and Jerry Baker reprised it in 2012. Since 2000, a notable military or government official has also offered a tribute or remarks.

The traditional preamble goes as follows:
{{quotation|''"On this Memorial Day weekend, we pause in a moment of silence, to pay homage to those individuals who have given their lives—unselfishly, and unafraid—so that we may witness as free men and women, the world's greatest sporting event. We also pay homage to those individuals, who have given their lives—unselfishly, and without fear—to make racing, the world's most spectacular spectator sport."''}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, "Taps" was typically performed by a combined [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] [[Colour guard|color guard]]. Then from the about 1980 through 2005, it was usually played by the full Purdue Band. In 1986 and 1997, due to rain delays, the Purdue Band was unable to stay for the pre-race ceremonies. In those years, a substitute performer(s) was used. Since 2006, "Taps" has been rendered as a trumpet solo. In 2016, the trumpeter moved from the trackside victory podium near the pits to the starter's stand outside the main stretch.

==="Back Home Again in Indiana"===
[[File:Jim Nabors.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Jim Nabors]] at the 2000 Indianapolis 500]]
The most traditional performance is the singing of "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]".&lt;ref name="Star05-08-1985pg29"&gt;{{cite news|title=Back home again in Indiana - 30 Days in May|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18898177/|first=Dan|last=Luzadder|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=29|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 8, 1985|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has accompanied the race since 1946. [[Jim Nabors]], accompanied by the Purdue Marching Band, notably performed the song in most years from 1972 to 2014. The song has long been the last event in the order of the day, immediately preceding the command to start engines.

During the song, thousands of multicolored [[Balloon release|balloons are released]] from an infield tent. The balloon release also dates back to 1946, but initially it did not coincide with the song.

The song, which was first published in 1917, is reported to have been first played at the race in 1919. A track side brass band played the song as Indiana-born [[Howdy Wilcox]] was finishing the final laps to victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/history/35196-Indy-500-Traditions/|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|author=|date=|work=IndianapolisMotorSpeedway.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the race was rained out on Sunday, and the start was rescheduled for Monday. Nabors (as well as the Purdue band), had left the grounds by Monday morning. Rather than find a last-minute replacement, Nabors suggested that the Speedway utilize a recording of one of his previous performances. The Speedway replayed his 1993 rendition, and it was well-received by the fans. Two days before the 2007 race, Nabors canceled his appearance due to an illness. On race morning, Nabors recorded a special video greeting to the fans from his Hawaii home, which was streamed over the Internet. Fans were invited to sing along with the Purdue band,&lt;ref name="traditions"&gt;[http://www.indy500.com/traditions/ Indianapolis 500 Traditions] Indy500.com&lt;/ref&gt; and a "get well soon" message was displayed for Nabors. In 2008, Nabors made a well-received return, and received a standing ovation at the public driver meeting.

Nabors again missed the race in 2012 due to an illness. This time, the Speedway sent a television crew to his home in Maui, and recorded a performance that was played on the video boards on race morning. In March 2014, Nabors announced that the 2014 race would be his final performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/default/news/show/52543-nabors-to-sing-and-39-indianaand-39-for-the-final-time-at-2014-indianapolis-500/|title=Nabors To Sing 'Indiana' For The Final Time at 2014 Indianapolis 500|work=[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]|date=March 25, 2014|access-date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Jim Cornelison]] was invited to sing, and his performance was critically praised. He was invited to return in 2018.&lt;ref name="jimc"/&gt;

===Starting command===
The call for the engines to start has been traditionally made by stating "Gentlemen, start your engines!" When female drivers have competed, the call has been amended to "Lady and gentlemen..." or "Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines." Beginning in 2017, the command has been recited as "Drivers, start your engines." The starting command is customarily recited by a ranking member of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] [[board of directors]], who also is a member of the [[Tony Hulman|Hulman]]-[[Mari Hulman George|George]] family.

The exact origin of the phrase is unclear, and there have been several conflicting accounts of who was the first to recite it, and what the exact wording of it was.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"&gt;{{cite episode|title=May 9, 2009|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley |author=[[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]]|url=http://www.1070thefan.com/|station=WFNI |location=Indianapolis |airdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to World War II, it was commonplace for an aerial bomb to signal the start of the engines.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt; Seth Kline was the official starter of the "500" in 1925–1926 &amp; 1934–1953. Kline is thought to have made an informal "Gentlemen, start your motors!" command as early as 1948 to accompany the bomb.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt; The first documented case was in 1950, and that was recited by prolific public address announcer John Francis "Irish" Horan.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clymer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Floys Clymer's 500 Yearbooks|date=1946–1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kline was again reported as saying it in 1951,&lt;ref name="30 Days 05-09-08"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sid Collins' 30 Days in May |series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley
|serieslink=Donald Davidson (historian)|url=http://www.1070thefan.com/|station=WFNI |location=Indianapolis |airdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though some report it was Horan&lt;ref name="Clymer"/&gt;) Either Kline&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt; or Horan said it again in 1952.&lt;ref name="Clymer"/&gt; It was around that time the command was changed from ''"...[[Electric motor|motors]]!"'' to ''"...[[Internal combustion engine|engines]]!"'' The participants and officials alike, preferred the more technical term "[[Internal combustion engine|engines]]" to describe their machines. [[Sid Collins]] stated that chief steward [[Harlan Fengler]] explained to him "there are no motors in the race, just engines."&lt;ref name="30 Days 05-09-08"/&gt;

[[Wilbur Shaw]], president of the Speedway in 1946–1954, was once believed to be the person who coined the phrase, and it was erroneously claimed in his autobiography that he recited it in all the post-World War II years until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw |first=Wilbur |authorlink=Wilbur Shaw |author2=Albert W. Bloemker |title=Gentlemen, Start Your Engines |publisher = Coward-McCann|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedway historian [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]], however, believes Shaw only recited it twice, in 1953 and 1954.

After Shaw's death, [[Tony Hulman]] started reciting the command, and made it popular and famous. The normally soft-spoken and shy Hulman had a proud and vociferous version of the command annually. Hulman would rehearse the line, perfecting it for [[Showmanship (performing)|show]], and was even known to work with radio broadcaster Luke Walton to draft cue cards to know when to stress certain words and syllables. After Hulman's death in 1977, his widow [[Mary Fendrich Hulman|Mary F. Hulman]] took over the honor, followed by their daughter [[Mari Hulman George|Mari George]].

In 1977, [[Janet Guthrie]] became the first [[List of female Indianapolis 500 drivers|female driver]] to qualify for the Indy 500. Controversy surrounded the command, because the Speedway management did not want to alter the traditional phrase.&lt;ref name="1977 TV"&gt;1977 Indianapolis 500 Telecast: ABC-TV, May 29, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; During the week before the race, the management announced that they would not change the wording of the command. Looking for an excuse, they insisted that the cars were actually started by male crew members with an electric hand-held starter from behind the car. Guthrie and her crew were quite displeased by the stubbornness of the Speedway management, considering her unprecedented accomplishment. The crew reacted by assigning Kay Bignotti&lt;ref name="1977 TV"/&gt; (wife of George Bignotti) as the crew member to operate the inertial starter at the back of Guthrie's car. The Speedway's argument fell apart, and they decided upon a special amended command for that year. They did not announce beforehand what the special command would be,&lt;ref name="1977 TV"/&gt; and [[Tony Hulman|Hulman's]] highly anticipated phrase was the following:

{{cquote|In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines.}}

In 1978–1979, when Guthrie again qualified for the race, the command was simply amended to "Lady and gentlemen, start your engines." In 1992, [[Lyn St. James]] became the second female to qualify for the race. She publicly requested, albeit not contentiously, that the command be changed to "Drivers, start your engines."&lt;ref name="Star05-24-1992pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title='92 call to start as much a mystery as race's winner|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18898752/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 24, 1992|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was dismissed, and the command used was the now customary "Lady and gentlemen..." variation. That variation, along with "Ladies and gentlemen..." were used many times over the next two decades. In 2017, [[Pippa Mann]] was the lone female driver in the field, and [[Tony George]] gave the command as "Drivers, start your engines." This was the first time that this variation of the command was used for the race.

For many years, the traditional location for giving the command was at the pace car in the front of the starting grid. Public address announcer Jim Philippe normally introduced the command, describing it as the "traditional command" or the "famous four words." Phillippe's final ''500'' was 2003. Likewise, for many years through 1989, Luke Walton traditionally introduced the command on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|radio network]] broadcast. Since 2004, current public address announcer Dave Calabro introduces the command normally by calling it the "most famous words in motorsports."

In most cases, [[Tony Hulman]] would give the command, then ride in the [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]] during the pace laps. [[Mary Fendrich Hulman|Mary F. Hulman]] would give the command near the pace car, but rarely rode in the pace car due to her age and declining health. Eventually, the location was moved to near the start/finish line, and in 2001, it was moved to the new Victory Podium stage adjacent to the Pagoda. In 2011 only, [[Mari Hulman George|Mari George]] moved back to the front of the starting grid to give the command, and then she rode in the pace car with [[A. J. Foyt]]. In 2014, as a special gesture to [[Jim Nabors]]'s final performance at Indy, the starting command was given in unison by both Mari George and Nabors, marking the first time a non-member of the Hulman-George family had given the command for the 500 since 1954. In 2016 for the [[2016 Indianapolis 500|100th Indianapolis 500]], now-matriarch Mari was joined by three subsequent generations of the Hulman-George family, who gave the command together. Due to her advanced age, the 2016 race would be Mari's final turn giving the command. Later that same year, [[Tony George]] gave the starting command for the [[Brickyard 400]], his first time giving a command since a restart command in 1986. For the [[2017 Indianapolis 500]], the duty was permanently assigned to [[Tony George]]. In that year, Tony George began using the phrase "Drivers, start your engines" instead of the more familiar "Lady and gentlemen..." variation.

On occasions when an accident or rain has halted the race, a second command has typically been given. Years include: 1967, 1973, 1982, 1986, 1997, 2004, 2007. The amended command, "gentlemen, re-start your engines," has usually been used. In 1986, this restart command was given by [[Tony George]]. In 1997, it was given by [[Mari Hulman George]]. In 1982 and 2004 the command was given by public address announcer [[Tom Carnegie]].

In 1981, Mary F. Hulman was unable to recite the starting command due to an illness. In that year, Mari George recited, her first time performing the honor.&lt;ref name="News05-23-1981pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wild, Early Dash For 500-Mile Lead Expected|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19099078/|first=Wayne|last=Fusion|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 1981|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the starting command has been adopted to start all sorts of auto racing in the United States, including but not limited to [[NASCAR]]. However, in many venues outside of Indy, the phrase "Drivers, start your engines" appears to be the preferred version.

===Honorary starter===
[[File:Reggie Miller Indianapolis 500-2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Reggie Miller]] in the starter's stand in [[2005 Indianapolis 500|2005]]]]
A recently-added tradition is the use of an honorary starter. A special guest has been invited in recent years to wave the green flag to start the race. Starting in 2013, the tradition was expanded where another celebrity or special guest(s) arrives on race morning by helicopter to ceremoniously deliver the green flag or the checkered flag. The official starter (or "flagman"), however, is a trained race official, and handles the remainder of the flagging duties during the race. In 2010, due to two early caution periods, honorary starter [[Jack Nicholson]] elected to stay in the starter's perch for an additional few minutes, and was able to drop the green for the two subsequent restarts as well.

===Celebrity guests===
Since the early years of the race, [[Celebrity|celebrities]] from all walks of fame have been invited to the race, some have returned for many years or even decades. Television and [[movie star]]s, recording artists, sports figures, [[politician]]s, and military, are among the many dignitaries invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2016/05/24/wahlberg-cheech-epps-kardashian-hasselhoff-nicholson-gable-indianapolis-speedway/84507360/|title=Indy 500: Ranking top 33 celebs who attended 99 races|publisher=IndyStar.com|first=David|last=Lindquist|date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the pre-race, a parade of stars is conducted around the track, usually in convertibles. In numerous years, celebrities have been invited to drive the [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]] at the start of the race.
[[File:LindaVaughn1997Indy500.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Linda Vaughn at the 1997 Indianapolis 500]]

[[Clark Gable]] is seen in a famous photograph of the [[1947 Indianapolis 500|1947 race]]. Among the many celebrities who attended or have attended multiple Indy 500s include [[Jim Nabors]], [[James Garner]] (who drove the pace car in 1975, 1977 and 1985), [[David Letterman]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Florence Henderson]], Linda Vaughn, and many others. [[Paul Newman]], who starred in the Indy-related film ''[[Winning]]'', attended the race many times, and in 1983–1995, and then again in 2008, was at the race as co-owner of [[Newman/Haas Racing]]. [[Joyce DeWitt]], who grew up in the [[Speedway, Indiana|Town of Speedway]], and graduated from [[Speedway Senior High School]], once worked at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ticket office.&lt;ref name="Star05-23-1981"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joyce DeWitt back home again for '500'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7312378//|first=Donna S.|last=Mullinax|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=9|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 1981|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] (and one future President) has attended the Indianapolis 500. [[Gerald Ford]] attended the [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979 race]], serving also as the [[grand marshal]] of the 500 Festival Parade.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/news/show/36511-president-ford-had-unique-connection-to-indianapolis-500/ |title=President Ford Had Unique Connection To Indianapolis 500|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|first=Paul|last=Kelly|date=2007-01-02|accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] attended the [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003 race]], the first time in Indy history that two former presidents were at the same race.&lt;ref name="Daily Trackside Report"&gt;2003 Indianapolis 500 – Daily Trackside Report&lt;/ref&gt; It was the elder Bush's second visit to the Speedway; he previously presided over the opening ceremonies of the [[1987 Pan American Games]], which was held at the track. Future President [[Donald Trump]] attended the race in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Post-race commentary by Chris Economacki on the 2002 Indianapolis 500 radio broadcast on the IMS Radio Network&lt;/ref&gt; Trump was selected to drive the pace car for the 2011 race, but withdrew the duty after drawing controversy from fans. In 1971, tentative plans were made for sitting president [[Richard Nixon]] to attend the race, as part of the NATO Conference on Urban Affairs that was being held in the city. Nixon was even rumored to be giving the starting command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Expected At 500, May Circle Track|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17293719/1971_indy_500_richard_nixon/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=March 25, 1971|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon would have been the first, and only to-date, sitting president to attend the race. However, the visit was later cancelled.

At least two presidential candidates have visited the Speedway during their respective election campaigns, owning much to the fact that the Indiana [[United States presidential primary|primary]] is usually held May. [[Ronald Reagan]] visited the track during the month of May 1976, while he was in town campaigning for the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]] [[Indiana]] [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|Republican primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/at-reagan-library-the-gipper-as-gearhead/?_r=1|title=At Reagan Library, the Gipper as Gearhead|publisher=New York Times|work=|first=Ronald|last=Ahrens|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://outlet.historicimages.com/products/dfpa89731|title=1976 Press Photo Ronald Reagan Drives Car Indy Raceway|publisher=Historic Images Outlet|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Hillary Clinton]] visited the track while campaigning for the [[Indiana Democratic primary, 2008|2008 Indiana primary]] and met with driver [[Sarah Fisher]].

At least three former [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidents]] have attended the race. The aforementioned Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Indiana native [[Dan Quayle]]. Qualye has attended the race numerous times, including three times as sitting Vice President (1989–1991). Current Vice President [[Mike Pence]] has reportedly attended the race over 30 times, most recently in 2016, while he was the sitting [[List of Governors of Indiana|Governor of Indiana]] and again in 2017 while he was sitting Vice President. In 2018, Pence visited the track during practice, but not on race day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wthr.com/article/vp-pence-visits-ims-as-andretti-again-tops-speed-chart-at-indy-500-practice|title=VP Pence visits IMS as Andretti again tops speed chart at Indy 500 practice|publisher=WTHR|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Letterman]] worked as a reporter for ABC Sports during the [[1971 Indianapolis 500|1971 race]], and attended the race many times as a spectator. Since 2002, he has attended the race as co-owner of [[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|Rahal Letterman Racing]]. The team won the race in [[2004 Indianapolis 500|2004]] with driver [[Buddy Rice]]. At the [[2015 Indianapolis 500|2015 race]], Letterman was honored on the famous scoring pylon during the pre-race; just four days after he retired from the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]''.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, several [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s from the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Apollo program]]s were among invited guests.

* For the entire history of the 500 mile race, the official winner of the race has been defined as the driver who completes the 500 mile distance first, sans penalties. A winner is declared with a finishing time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Finishers behind the winner were given additional time – upwards of an hour in early years – to complete the 500 mile distance. In very early years, completing the full 500 miles was a requirement to receive prize money. Later, it was because completing the 500 mile distance at an average speed of over 100 mph earned a driver a spot in the prestigious Champion Spark Plug [[100 mph Club]]. In 1964 as live television arrived, this "extra time" was reduced to about five minutes, and after 1974, when raucous fans ran out on the track at the checkered flag, extra time was eliminated. 1975 was the first year in which the lap the winner finishes the race is the final lap for ''all'' competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://doctorindy.com/2015/10/28/the-fastest-500s-part-1/#comment-301|title=The Fastest 500s (Part 1)|date=2015-10-28|work=JI500|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Gordon Johncock]] was said to have completed the 500 miles in lesser elapsed time than winner [[Graham Hill]], second place [[Jim Clark]], and even third place [[Jim McElreath]]. However, Johncock had suffered minor damage during the first lap accident, and restarted the race in the pit lane due to the crew changing the nose cone. USAC officials did not score his first lap out of the pit lane, and he effectively ran all day carrying a one lap penalty to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* The cars begin the race in a rolling start, traditionally in eleven rows of three, for a field of 33 total cars. Most other automobile races have two cars per row. The 33-car field derives from a 1919 [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] mandate of one car for every 400 feet (120 m) of track. Early races, however, saw varying numbers of starters, from as low as 21, to as high as 42. The number of cars in each row also varied, with as many as five abreast. Since 1933 there have only been the following exceptions to having a field of 33 racers:
** In 1941, 33 cars initially qualified for the field during time trials. [[Sam Hanks]] was injured in a practice crash the day before the race and withdrew. Then on the morning of the race, [[George Barringer]]'s car was destroyed in a fire that swept through the garage area, thus only 31 cars lined up to start the race.
** In 1947, only 30 cars qualified. A boycott over the purse led to the smaller field.
** In [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]], after a rules dispute over turbocharger inlets, and after controversy regarding the refusal of some entries from members of the [[Champ Car|CART]] series, a special fifth day of qualifying was added. However, only two cars ran sufficient speeds to be added to the field, and 35 cars lined up to start the race. Heavy attrition early on saw one car fail to complete a lap, and 7 cars out by lap 22.
** In [[1997 Indianapolis 500|1997]], which used an "all exempt tour" concept similar to the [[PGA Tour]] since 1983, the top 25 teams headed in Indy Racing League team entry points standings earned exemptions into the field, with the top nine non-exempt cars making the race on speed. Some exempt teams bumped out other non-exempt cars that had actually qualified with faster speeds, but their teams were not in the top 25 of League points. Two bumped cars were restored to the field to ensure that the "33 fastest entries" were part of the field, for a total of 35 starters. Ironically on the pace lap, three cars crashed out together, while two suffered mechanical problems, and only 30 cars took the green flag. (A similar rule was used at the [[Brickyard 400|Crown Royal presents the Your Hero's Name Here 400]] from 2005 to 2012 and the [[Lilly Diabetes 250]] from 2012 to 2014. Both were NASCAR races which guaranteed a position for the top 35 drivers in the owners standings in the [[Sprint Cup Series]] and top 30 drivers for the [[Xfinity Series]].)

* [[Tom Carnegie]] announced on June 9, 2006 that the previous month's race, would be his last as official chief track announcer. Having called the race since 1946 on the [[public address system]], he is best known for his lines, "He's/She's on it!" (signaling the start of a qualifying attempt), "It's a new track record!" (when a driver surpasses either a one- or four-lap track record in qualifications), and "He's slowing down on the backstretch!" or "Andretti is slowing down!" (The latter for the [[Andretti Curse|Andretti family's historical misfortune]] at Indianapolis.).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Paul. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=6828 Legendary P.A. Announcer Carnegie Steps Down After 61 Years At IMS], Indy500.com, June 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie was also known for opening each day in May when the track was open to the public with the words, "Good morning, race fans!"  After Carnegie's retirement, '''Dave Calabro''', sports director of Indianapolis' NBC affiliate [[WTHR]], became the second chief PA announcer in the Hulman-George era for the 2007 race and ever since.
* With the race scheduled for the month of May, the on-track activities are often at the mercy of [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] springtime rain showers. Numerous practice days, qualifying days, and race days, over the years have been halted, [[Rainout (sports)|delayed or washed out]] due to inclement weather. Since the cars can not race on a wet or damp course, rainy weather (and even rainy forecasts) are often despised by fans and competitors. Track owner [[Tony Hulman]] was said to have loathed rainy weather at the track, quipping that if he woke up on race day to rainy weather he "would just assume crawl under the bed and stay there". Days at the track that feature plentiful sunshine, warm, pleasant temperatures, and no precipitation, are said to be experiencing "Tony Hulman weather".

===Victory Lane===
[[File:IndianapolisMotorSpeedwayVictoryLane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Victory Lane at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.]]

[[File:Takuma Sato at Indy500 2017.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2017 Indy 500 winner [[Takuma Sato]] celebrates his victory.]]

Immediately after taking the checkered flag, the race winner drives to Victory Lane. The celebration to honor the winner begins with the car being wheeled onto a black and white checkered periphery. The driver is presented with the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]], which is situated behind the car in a prominent location. A floral wreath is placed around the winners neck, and the winner is presented with the traditional bottle of milk for refreshment. Interviews are taken for television, radio, and over the public address system. The driver's crew and team owner(s) also are invited to celebrate in victory lane, and are joined by numerous dignitaries, including the 500 Festival Queen and Princesses court, track and series personalities, celebrities, and various sponsor representatives. The Indianapolis 500 notably does not utilize a [[Podium#Usage in motorsport|podium]] for the top-three finishers as is customary in other forms of racing, as well as at most other IndyCar events. Only the winning driver and team participate in victory lane celebrations, believed to be an homage to horse racing's Winner's Circle.

In the early years, victory lane was located at the far south end of the pit area, near the entrance to Turn One. For many years, it was identified by a large black and white checkered carpet. This location was used through 1970. In 1971, victory lane was moved to the horseshoe area located in front of the Master Control Tower. The car would be rolled up two checkered ramps, to a raised platform a few feet above the ground. In 1986, a new victory lane was constructed, which was a hydraulic lift in the pit lane. In 1994, after the pit lane was reconstructed, victory lane was moved back to the horseshoe area, this time on a large cylindrical platform.

The current victory lane is located beneath the Victory Podium stage, adjacent to the Pagoda. The [[Podium|podium]], which was originally built for the U.S. Grand Prix to serve as a 1st-2nd-3rd podium for that event, is not used as a podium for the Indy 500 or for the Brickyard 400. Instead it is utilized as a stage for pre-race ceremonies.

===Bottle of milk===
A long-standing tradition of the Indianapolis 500 is for the winner to drink a bottle of milk immediately after the race. This tradition dates back to 1936 after victor [[Louis Meyer]] asked for a glass of buttermilk, something his mother had encouraged him to drink on hot days. Meyer also reportedly drank milk after his victory in 1933, as did a few others in the immediate years afterward. The young tradition quickly went away, and for a time after World War II, was replaced by "Water From Wilbur" – a silver [[jug (container)|jug]] (resembling an ice bucket) filled with icy-cold water, presented by then-Speedway president, and three-time former winner [[Wilbur Shaw]].

By 1956, the milk returned as a ritual as milk companies became sponsors of the race purse and handed a bottle of milk to the winner to promote their product.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; A [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] of currently $10,000 now paid out by the [[American Dairy Association]] if the winner sips the milk in victory lane. In [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] drank [[orange juice]] instead of milk after his victory. The snub drew considerable ire from fans. Later he took a sip of milk, at the urging of his car owner Roger Penske. Fittipaldi owned citrus farms in Brazil, and wished to promote his industry. As a result, he was booed in driver's introductions the following week by the crowd in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], in the heart of "[[Dairy farming|America's Dairyland]]." In 1981, [[Bobby Unser]] also did not drink the milk in victory lane.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donald Davidson (historian)|The Talk of Gasoline Alley]]'' – [[WFNI]], April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After Unser was tentatively stripped of his victory, [[Mario Andretti]] sipped from a bottle of milk the next morning during the traditional photo shoot.

===Borg-Warner Trophy===
{{main|Borg-Warner Trophy}}
A [[bas-relief]] sculpture of the winner's face, along with his name, average speed, and date of victory is added to the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]]. The trophy has been in use since 1936.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; A smaller replica of this trophy has been officially presented to the winner after the race since 1988 and team principal since 1997, usually in a press conference either at the Speedway or in Detroit at the [[North American International Auto Show]] at the [[BorgWarner]] exhibit, except for the 2011 race because of extenuating circumstances ([[Dan Wheldon|the winning driver]] had died in a crash at an aborted INDYCAR race; [[Bryan Herta|the winning team principal]] and the driver's widow were presented with the respective trophies in the ensuing January). Prior to that, winners received a replica mounted on a chestnut plaque.

===Other celebrations===
*The Gordon Pipers [[bagpipes]] marching band has performed traditionally at the Indianapolis 500 since 1962. The band marches and performs during the 500 Festival Parade, during pre-race ceremonies, and plays while the winner is being wheeled into victory lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wishtv.com/top-video/55-years-of-tradition-inside-the-indianapolis-500-gordon-pipers/1064214175|title=55 years of tradition: Inside the Indianapolis 500 Gordon Pipers|publisher=WISHTV.com|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Celebratory [[Burnout (vehicle)|burnouts]] or "[[Doughnut (driving)|donuts]]," while not specifically prohibited by the rules, are generally discouraged and frowned upon at the Indianapolis 500. Burnouts in IndyCar racing in general are often prohibited by the teams themselves, as they potentially inflict damage on the engines, which are subject to strict mileage usage and rebuild intervals.
*Impromptu celebrations at locations other than the formal victory lane area are also discouraged, and sometimes considered a breach of tradition. The lone exception in the past many years has been [[Hélio Castroneves]], who made a signature of climbing the catchfence after his victories. In 2016, [[Alexander Rossi]] ran out of fuel on his cool down lap, and his car coasted to a halt out on the track. He then sprung from his car to wave to fans in turn four. He was quickly towed to victory lane, and the formal celebrations began as normal.
*At some point after the victory lane celebration, the winner is whisked away and rides for a lap around the track in the pace car to salute the fans.
*The tradition of the winning driver and crew kissing the yard of bricks that mark the start/finish, started by [[Dale Jarrett]] at the [[1996 Brickyard 400]], appears to have carried over to the Indy 500, starting with [[Gil de Ferran]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13020015/ Hornish Jr. ruins Andrettis’ ‘fairytale’ Indy], Associated Press, May 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected awards===
*'''Pace car''': The race winner has been awarded one of the [[pace car]]s, or a replica, almost every year since 1936. In 1941, there were only six copies of the special [[Chrysler Newport]] Phaeton, and no production models created. The co-winners did not receive it. In 1946, an [[oil painting]] and a trip&lt;ref name="Star05-09-1946f"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Air Trip Is "500" Prize|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5855731/1946_indianapolis_500/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 9, 1946|access-date=July 11, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; was substituted as the award, but winner [[George Robson (racing driver)|George Robson]] died in a motor sports accident before he received it. In 1971, [[Al Unser]] received a [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] from Palmer Dodge in the Indianapolis area, after the [[Dodge Challenger]] pace car was damaged in the start crash. Palmer repaired the car and kept it until selling in 2006 to local car collector Steven Cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021233428/http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/10/20/infamous-1971-dodge-challenger-to-take-part-in-largest-ever-display-of-indy-500-pace-cars/|title=Infamous 1971 Dodge Challenger to take part in largest-ever display of Indy 500 pac - Hemmings Daily|date=21 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[Dodge Viper]] was still a prototype vehicle, and only two were in existence. Winner [[Rick Mears]] was awarded instead a [[Dodge Stealth]], which was to be the original pace car but after protests by the [[UAW]] (because the Stealth was a [[captive import]] built by Mitsubishi in Japan), they were instead used at the track for festival cars.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;
*'''Rookie of the Year''': Since 1952, the [[Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award has been presented for the most outstanding performance by a rookie (first year) driver. The award is voted on by a panel of experts, and does not necessarily go to the highest finishing rookie.
*'''Louis Schwitzer Award''': The [[Louis Schwitzer Award]] is presented annually to an engineer, or a team of engineers, for excellence in the design, development and implementation of new, innovative motorsports technology concepts for use in the Indianapolis 500.
*'''Jigger Award''': The [[Leon Sirois#The Jigger Award|Jigger Award]] is presented by the American Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Association (AARWBA) for the "hard-luck" driver during time trials. It is in reference to the infamous qualifying gaffe of [[Leon Sirois|Leon Duray "Jigger" Sirois]] at the [[1969 Indianapolis 500|1969 race]]. Selection criteria is very loose, and sometimes lighthearted, but the recipient is usually one of the last drivers bumped from the field, or a driver who fails to qualify (especially if he/she made several unsuccessful attempts).
*'''Quilt''': Among the numerous awards presented to the winner is the traditional Winner's [[Quilt]]. Since 1976, Jeanetta Holder has hand-crafted a special quilt blanket for the winner, which features an Indy-related design. She presents the quilt to the winning driver the morning after the race, during the traditional winner's photo shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/#/indycar/news/granny-s-quilts-keep-indy-500-winners-warm/?v=3&amp;f=1&amp;s=1&amp;i=1|title=Granny's Quilts Keep Indy 500 Winners Warm|publisher=Motorsport.com|date=June 4, 2011|access-date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Winner's photo''': The morning after the race, the winning driver and team participates in the traditional winner's photo shoot at the start-finish line. The 1981 photo shoot is notable in that race winner [[Bobby Unser]] was stripped of the victory when official results were posted. Second place [[Mario Andretti]] was elevated to the win, and Andretti took part in the photo shoot. Later in the year, Unser was reinstated the victory, having never sat for a session of official winner photographs. In 2009, heavy rain on Monday morning forced [[Hélio Castroneves]]' photo shoot to take place indoors.
*'''Victory Banquet''': The night after the race, the prizes are distributed at the annual 500 Victory Banquet. The traditional awards banquet dates back many decades. In 1972, the black-tie gala was moved to the [[Indiana Convention Center]], and was held there until the mid-2000s. In more recent years, it has been held at a pavilion on the grounds of the Speedway. The 1973 banquet was cancelled due to the rain delay and tragic circumstances surrounding the event. For a brief time (2000–2001), the banquet was held on Sunday night, a few hours after the conclusion of the race. The 2000 race did not end until nearly 6 p.m. due to a rain delay, and participants had to rush downtown to make the banquet on time. In 2002, the banquet was moved back to Monday night. In 1986, the race was delayed until the following Saturday due to rain, and the banquet was cancelled due to scheduling concerns. A private victory luncheon for the top three finishers was held the day after the race at the Speedway Motel.

===Official standings===
For many years, the results of the race were considered unofficial until the following day. Immediately after the race, the sanctioning body would begin reviewing the scoring serials, as well as examine video tapes and film, in order to confirm the results, correct scoring errors, make judgements on rules infractions, and assess penalties (or rescind penalties) if necessary. It was not unusual for the vetting process to go late into the evening, beyond midnight, and into the early hours of the next morning. Traditionally, [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] would post the official results at 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time the morning after the race. Revisions were not unusual, as assessed penalties and scoring corrections would be announced in the official standings. However, most corrections were relatively minor, and seldom did drivers lose or gain positions in the final standings. A brief protest period would open for the teams to formally submit complaints, and if there were no protests, the official results would stand as published.

This policy was often a source of controversy, as in earlier years, this made officials apt to document rules infractions as they occurred, but not assess penalties until ''after'' the race – rather than during the race. Drivers and teams were sometimes not made fully aware of rules infractions until after they were issued a penalty the next morning. This prevented teams from being able to strategize and make up the penalty deficits during the race itself. In some cases, the penalty dropped them one or more positions in the final standings. By the early to mid-1990s, in-race penalties became the preferred method of assessment, namely the [[Glossary of motorsport terms#S|stop &amp; go penalty]], and currently the [[Glossary of motorsport terms#D|drive-through penalty]].

The most famous instances of protest occurred in [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981]] and [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]].{{Says who|date=March 2017}}

Starting in 1990, a new electronic scoring system was implemented, simplifying the scoring process.&lt;ref name="Star05-25-1991a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Splitting Seconds – Time runs out foor stopwatches at speedway (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13403042/|first=Joseph T.|last=Hallinan|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=27|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 25, 1991|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star05-25-1991b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Splitting Seconds – Time runs out foor stopwatches at speedway (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13403053/|first=Joseph T.|last=Hallinan|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=28|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 25, 1991|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, officials were done compiling the official standings very early Sunday evening, but still withheld the official release until 8 a.m. the next day. By 1993, the rules were amended such that the official standings would be released approximately six hours following the conclusion of the race (rather than the next morning).&lt;ref name="Star05-29-1993"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indy 500 facts|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13575939/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=44|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 29, 1993|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely because computer and [[GPS]]-based scoring systems had automated the process, and barring any equipment malfunctions (as happened at [[Firestone 600|Texas]] in 1997), serial scoring errors were almost non-existent; and significantly more accurate and reliable than previous hand-scoring methods. Manually-assessed penalties (such as one-lap penalties assessed for violations that occurred very late in the race) are occasionally a focus of post-race analysis and scoring revision, as those penalties are typically unable to be served before the race concludes.

A '''jersey''' is an item of [[knit]]ted [[clothing]], traditionally in [[wool]] or [[cotton]], with [[sleeve]]s, worn as a [[Sweater|pullover]], as it does not open at the front, unlike a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]. It is acommonly worn by sports teams as part of the team uniform, in team colors, often with a required number and optionally the player's name on the back. It is usually close-fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a [[guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]] that is more often hand knit with a thicker [[yarn]]. The word is usually used interchangeably with [[sweater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0040517507078023|title=Studies on the Influence of Knit Structure and Stitch Length on Ring and Compact Yarn Single Jersey Fabric Properties|first1=C.D.|last1=Kane|first2=U.J.|last2=Patil|first3=P.|last3=Sudhakar|date=1 August 2007|publisher=|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=77|issue=8|pages=572–582|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0040517507078023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a jersey as used in [[sport]] is a [[shirt]] worn by a member of a team, typically depicting the [[sportsperson|athlete]]'s name and team number as well as the [[logotype]] of the team or corporate sponsor. [[Cycling jersey]]s of specific color or pattern represent certain statuses in [[cycling]], such as the yellow jersey of the leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France]], or the [[rainbow jersey]] for the world champion.  Cycling jerseys are usually made of synthetic [[microfiber]] material to aid in wicking sweat away from the skin to allow it to [[evaporate]].  The main garment of an [[ice hockey]] uniform, which was traditionally called a sweater, is increasingly known as a [[hockey jersey]]. This garment, along with [[basketball]] jerseys which are usually [[sleeveless]] and [[baseball]] jerseys which are usually button up, have become fashion accessories. A related term is "[[Bib (garment)|bib]]", which may refer to a shirt (jersey, esp. in Britain{{citation needed|reason=Lived here all my life, never once heard anyone use bib to mean shirt/jersey|date=February 2018}}). In [[Australian rules football]], the player's shirt is known as a "[[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004051755502500314|title=An Engineering Approach to Jersey Fabric Construction|first=W.E.|last=Shinn|date=1 March 1955|publisher=|journal=Textile Research Journal|volume=25|issue=3|pages=270–277|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/004051755502500314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemdvoorhem.nl/|title=Hemdvoorhem.nl - Gratis verzending en 100 dagen gratis retour|website=www.hemdvoorhem.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sports, such as [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and various [[football]] codes, a player's jersey may be "[[retired number#See also|retired]]".  When a jersey is retired that player's jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honor of that player's accomplishment.  Generally, when a jersey is retired, the [[Number (sports)|number]] on the player's jersey is made unavailable for future players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jaCjAgAAQBAJ|title=Textiles in Sport|first=Roshan|last=Shishoo|date=29 August 2005|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In organized [[sport]]s, '''match fixing''' occurs as a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to obtain a payoff from gamblers, but teams may also intentionally perform poorly to gain a future advantage, such as a better [[draft pick]]{{efn-ua|{{clear}}

Match fixing, when motivated by gambling, requires contacts (and normally money transfers) between gamblers, players, team officials, and/or referees. These contacts and transfers can sometimes be found, and lead to prosecution by the law or the sports league(s). In contrast, losing for future advantage is internal to the team and very hard to prove. Often, substitutions made by the coach designed to deliberately increase the team's chances of losing (such as having key players sit out, using minimal or phantom injuries as an excuse), rather than ordering the players actually on the field to intentionally underperform, are cited as the main factor in cases where this has been alleged.

Match fixing generally refers to fixing the final result of the game. Another form of match fixing, known as [[spot fixing]], involves fixing small events within a match which can be gambled upon, but which are unlikely to prove decisive in determining the final result of the game.

Other names for match fixing include '''game fixing''', '''race fixing''', '''sports fixing''', or '''hippodroming'''.  Games that are deliberately lost are sometimes called '''thrown games'''.  When a team intentionally loses a game, or does not score as high as it can, to obtain a perceived future competitive advantage, the team is often said to have '''tanked''' the game instead of having thrown it. In [[hustling|pool hustling]], tanking is known as '''dumping'''. In sports where a handicap system exists and is capable of being abused, tanking is known as [[Glossary of cue sports terms#sandbag|sandbag]]ging.

==Motivations and causes==
The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and future team advantage.

===Agreements with gamblers===
{{Main article|Match fixing related to gambling}}

There may be financial gain through agreements with [[gambling|gamblers]]. The most infamous example of this in North America was the [[Black Sox Scandal]] of 1919, in which several members of the [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] conspired with gamblers to fix the [[1919 World Series|World Series]].

One of the best-known examples of gambling-related race fixing (in motorsports) is the 1933 [[Tripoli Grand Prix]], in which the winning number of the lottery was determined by the number of the race-winning car. One ticket holder held the number belonging to [[Achille Varzi]], contacted him and agreed to share the winning should he win. Varzi contacted other drivers who agreed to share the money if they deliberately lost. Despite a poor start, Varzi won the race after his opponents deliberately underperformed throughout the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The race that was rigged? |author=Martin Williamson |year=2010 |url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/21012.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sportradar]], a company that monitors the integrity of sports events on behalf of sports federations, as many as 1% of the matches they monitor are likely to be fixed.&lt;ref name='fixersbeware' /&gt;

====Protection against manipulation====
By monitoring the pre-match betting markets it is possible to detect planned match fixing. It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at the in-game betting markets. Several federations have employed services that provide such systems for detecting match manipulation.&lt;ref name='fixersbeware'&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixers beware|url=https://www.gamblinginsider.com/in-depth/1667/fixers-beware|website=Gambling Insider|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2016 MLB season, Major League Baseball (MLB) hired Genius Sports, a sports technology company specialising in integrity, to monitor the betting patterns on all of their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/mlb-is-keeping-a-very-close-eye-on-gambling-to-protect-the-sports-integrity/2016/05/30/0581b24a-1ed5-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html|title=The Washington Post|last=|first=|date=30 May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several federations run integrity tours where players and officials participate in educational workshops on how match fixing work and how they are prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Fantasy Sports Spell The End Of Corruption In Athletics?|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/do-fantasy-sports-spell-the-end-of-corruption-in-athletics/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Better playoff chances===
Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines their opponent in the next round. As a result, by losing a match, a team can face an easier opponent in the next round, making them more likely to win. Although aligned with tanking, this action is generally viewed as acceptable in American sports.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the [[National Basketball Association]], there have also been allegations{{By whom|date=August 2012}} of teams tanking games to finish in sixth rather than fifth place in the conference standings, thus enabling the team in question to evade a possible playoff match with the conference's top seed until the final round of playoffs in that conference (for more details see [[single-elimination tournament]]).  Additionally, the NBA is the only one of the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] of the [[United States]] in which home advantage in the playoffs is based strictly on regular-season record without regard to seeding. This led to (unproven) allegations of late-season tanking by the [[2005–06 Los Angeles Clippers season|2005–06 Los Angeles Clippers]] in order to finish sixth instead of fifth in their conference; because of the league's playoff hosting rules, the Clippers would have home advantage in the 3–6 matchup but not the 4–5 matchup.  Following that season, the NBA changed its playoff format so that the best second-place team in each conference would be able to obtain up to the #2 seed should it have the second-best conference record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/article.jsp?content=20060802_150747_2508]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729073129/http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/article.jsp?content=20060802_150747_2508 |date=July 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA has since changed its playoff format again, now awarding playoff berths to the top eight teams in each conference without regard to divisional alignment.

On occasion, a [[National Football League]] team has also been accused of throwing its final regular-season game in an attempt to "choose" its possible opponent in the subsequent playoffs.

Perhaps the most notable example of this was when the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who had clinched a playoff berth, lost their regular-season finale in [[1988 NFL season|1988]] to the [[Los Angeles Rams]], thereby knocking the [[New York Giants]] (who had defeated the 49ers in the playoffs in both 1985 and 1986, also injuring 49er quarterback [[Joe Montana]] in the latter year's game) out of the postseason on tiebreakers; after the game, Giants quarterback [[Phil Simms]] angrily accused the 49ers of "laying down like dogs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-12-31/sports/17459066_1_49ers-jeff-fisher-rest-players |last=Miller | first=Ira | date=March 31, 2004 | title=Can't blame 'em for not trying | publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Canadian Football League]], since the introduction of the ''cross-over rule'' [[CFL West Division|Western]] teams have been occasionally accused of tanking near the end of the season in situations where a loss would cause them to finish fourth place in their division and where such a finish was still good enough to secure a berth in the league's [[CFL East Division|East Division]] playoffs. In recent years, the East has often been viewed to be a weaker division than the West; however, if any Western team has actually attempted such a strategy up to and included the [[2014 CFL season|2014 season]], it has not paid significant dividends for them since Western cross-over teams have only won one Eastern playoff game and have never advanced to the [[Grey Cup]] championship game from the Eastern bracket.

A more recent example of possible tanking occurred in the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|ice hockey competition]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. In Pool B, [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] was to face [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovakia]] in the last pool match for both teams. Sweden coach [[Bengt-Åke Gustafsson]] publicly contemplated tanking against Slovakia, knowing that if his team won, their quarterfinal opponent would either be [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] gold medalists, or the [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]] gold medalists. Gustafsson would tell Swedish television "One is [[cholera]], the other [[bubonic plague|the plague]]." Sweden lost the match 3–0; the most obvious sign of tanking was when Sweden had a five-on-three [[power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] with five [[National Hockey League|NHL]] stars—[[Peter Forsberg]], [[Mats Sundin]], [[Daniel Alfredsson]], [[Nicklas Lidström]], and [[Fredrik Modin]]—on the ice, and failed to put a shot on goal. (''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, "If the Swedes had passed the puck any more, their next opponent would have been the [[Washington Generals]].") If he was seeking to tank, Gustafsson got his wish; Sweden would face a much less formidable quarterfinal opponent in [[Switzerland men's national ice hockey team|Switzerland]]. Canada would lose to [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]] in a quarterfinal in the opposite bracket, while Sweden went on to win the gold medal, defeating the Czechs in the semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2006/03/06/8371329/swede-success |last=Farber | first=Michael | date=March 6, 2006 | title=Swede Success | work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1998 Tiger Cup]] – an [[international]] [[association football|football]] tournament contested by countries in [[Southeast Asia]] – saw an example of two teams trying to lose a match. The tournament was hosted by [[Vietnam]] and the eight countries competing were split into two groups of four. The top two in each group advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing the runners-up of the other group. In the first group [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] won the group with [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] finishing second. This meant that the winners of the second group would have to travel to [[Hanoi]] to play the host nation in the national stadium on their national day whilst the runners-up would face Singapore in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] where the final group match was taking place. As the two teams involved - [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] - had both already qualified for the semi-finals it was in their interest to lose the match and finish in second place. As the game progressed neither side seemed particularly concerned with scoring whilst the defending was lackadaisical. As the match entered stoppage time the Indonesian defender [[Mursyid Effendi]] scored an [[own goal]] (overcoming the efforts of the opposition players to stop him). Both teams were fined $40,000 and Effendi was banned from international football for life.

The [[2012 Summer Olympics]] saw at least two examples of actual or potential tanking of this type:
* In the most famous example, members of the [[China at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Chinese]], [[Indonesia at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Indonesian]] and [[South Korea at the 2012 Summer Olympics|South Korean]] [[badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics|badminton]] teams were disqualified for intentionally losing matches to allow better pairings in the knockout stages of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/top-doubles-pairs-in-badminton-booed-appearing-to-play-to-lose-group-match-at-wembley-arena/2012/07/31/gJQARsdiNX_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807032948/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/top-doubles-pairs-in-badminton-booed-appearing-to-play-to-lose-group-match-at-wembley-arena/2012/07/31/gJQARsdiNX_story.html |archive-date=7 August 2012 |title=Indonesian official: 8 badminton players disqualified from Olympic doubles for trying to lose |publisher=Washington Post |date=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677 |title=Olympics badminton: Eight women disqualified from doubles | publisher=BBC | date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what the BBC called a “night of shame,” players made simple errors throughout the match, despite boos from the crowd and warnings from the match referee to cease and desist. The [[Badminton World Federation]] had charged the four pairs with “not using one’s best efforts to win a match” and “conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/08/01/expelled-olympic-badminton-players-cant-even-get-cheating-right/ | title=Expelled Olympic badminton players win gold for lack of subtlety | date=1 August 2012 | publisher=''National Post'' | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120802002902/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/08/01/expelled-olympic-badminton-players-cant-even-get-cheating-right/ | archivedate=2 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's football tournament]], [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] intentionally played to a draw with [[South Africa women's national football team|South Africa]] in [[Millennium Stadium|Cardiff]] so that it could finish second in its group and not have to travel to [[Hampden Park|Glasgow]], more than 300 miles away, for the first round of the knockout stage.  Instead, Japan remained in Cardiff and defeated [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] in the ensuing quarterfinal match en route to the gold medal match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/martin-rogers-japans-womens-soccer-023300712--sow.html |title=Martin Rogers: Japan's women's soccer team plays to intentional draw | date=1 August 2012 | publisher=Yahoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, two girls' basketball teams representing [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-area [[Riverdale High School (Murfreesboro, Tennessee)|Riverdale]] and [[Smyrna High School (Tennessee)|Smyrna High Schools]] were found to be tanking a consolation match of their district tournament.&lt;ref name=Kreager&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnj.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/02/23/riverdale-smyrna-removed-postseason/23888217/ |title=Riverdale, Smyrna girls basketball teams removed from postseason |first=Tom |last=Kreager |newspaper=[[The Daily News Journal]] |location=[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]] |date=February 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the game would enter the same side of the regional tournament bracket as defending state champion&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt; [[Blackman High School]] (ranked as one of the country's top 10 teams by some national publications), setting up a potential match in the regional semifinals.&lt;ref name=Bonesteel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/02/24/heres-why-two-tennessee-girls-basketball-teams-both-tried-to-lose/ |title=Here’s why two Tennessee girls’ basketball teams both tried to lose |first=Matt |last=Bonesteel |work=Early Lead |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loser would avoid Blackman until the regional final, a game whose participants would both advance to the sectional tournament (one step short of the state tournament).&lt;ref name=Bonesteel/&gt; During this game:
* Both coaches pulled their starters early.&lt;ref name=Bonesteel/&gt;
* Riverdale intentionally missed more than a dozen free throws.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;
* Smyrna deliberately committed several failure to cross the midcourt line and over-and-back violations.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;
* Players from both teams deliberately tried to be called for 3-second violations. At one point, a player gave the official a 3-second signal in an attempt to get called.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonesteel/&gt;
* The final straw for the officials was when a Smyrna player attempted an [[own goal]] that did not count because the team had already been called for failure to cross the midcourt line in time. The officials then called both coaches aside, accusing them of making a mockery of the game.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;

The [[Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association]], which governs high school sports in the state, took a very dim view of this escapade, banning both teams from further postseason play, fining the two schools a total of $1,500, and placing both teams on probation through the 2015–16 school year.&lt;ref name=Kreager/&gt;

On the other hand, the practice of coaches on a playoff-bound team deliberately benching a team's best players for some or all of the final match(es) of the regular season is often defended as a common sense measure to avoid unnecessarily risking injuries and fatigue to the team's star players. Some argue that a coach not only should have the right but ought to select a starting lineup for a match that gives the team the best chance of winning titles in the long run, should this be a different lineup compared to the one that gives his team the best chance of winning the upcoming game. Of course, when coaches elect to do this, they are not necessarily deliberately trying to lose. For example, during Euro 2004 the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] rested nearly all of its starters from the first two group matches for the final group match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Since the Czechs had already clinched first place in the group, this move was seen to have the potential to allow Germany a better chance get the win they needed to advance at the expense of the winner of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]-[[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] game. As it happened, the Czechs' decision to field a "weaker" side did not matter since the Czechs won the match anyway to eliminate the Germans.

===Better draft position===
{{rquote|right|Sometimes my job is to understand the value of losing. I know that sounds crazy, but if you're an NBA general manager like me, the last place you want to be is in the middle. There are only two outcomes there: Either make the playoffs and be first-round fodder for one of the premier teams or miss the playoffs and pick somewhere around 11th to 14th in the draft. Either way, the odds are that you stay in that middle range. It's a recipe for disaster.|Anonymous, 2013{{r|goodman20131029}}}}

Most top-level sports leagues in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North America]] and [[Sport in Australia|Australia]] hold [[Draft (sports)|drafts]] to allocate young players to the league's teams. The order in which teams select players is often the inverse of their standings in the previous season. As a result, a team may have a significant incentive to tank games to secure a higher pick in the league's next draft, and a number of leagues have changed their draft rules to remove (or at least limit) potential incentives to tank.

From [[1966 NBA draft|1966]] to [[1984 NBA draft|1984]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] used a coin flip between the teams with the worst records in each of the league's two conferences to determine the recipient of the top pick. In the {{nbay|1983|app=season}}, several teams were accused of deliberately losing games in an attempt to gain a top position in the [[1984 NBA draft|1984 draft]], which would eventually produce four [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame players]]. As a result of this, the NBA established a [[NBA draft lottery|draft lottery]] in advance of the [[1985 NBA draft|1985 draft]], involving all teams that did not make the playoffs in the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2005/05/22/2005-05-22_the_draft_that_changed_it_al.html |title=The Draft That Changed It All.

Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the current lottery gives the team with the worst record only a 25% chance at the top pick (with that team guaranteed no worse than the fourth pick), there can still be some incentive for a team to tank.  In an interview for ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' before the {{nbay|2013|app=season}}, an NBA general manager who chose to remain anonymous (though speculated to be either [[Rob Hennigan]] of the [[Orlando Magic]] or [[Ryan McDonough (NBA executive)|Ryan McDonough]] of the [[Phoenix Suns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/one-nba-general-manager-admits-tanking-2013-14-192122473--nba.html |title=One NBA general manager admits to tanking the 2013-14 season … anonymously |first=Kelly |last=Dwyer |work=Ball Don't Lie |publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]] |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) stated that because "the last place you want to be is in the middle", his team would try to tank that season to have the best chance at a top pick in the [[2014 NBA draft]], which was anticipated to be one of the deepest in recent league history. The GM explained how he got the team's owners and the coach to agree to it while trying to keep it a secret from the players.&lt;ref name=goodman20131029&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9893551/anonymous-nba-gm-why-team-tank-season-espn-magazine |title=The art of the tank |first=Jeff |last=Goodman |publisher=''ESPN The Magazine'' |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |quote=Our team isn't good enough to win and we know it.

Sometimes my job is to understand the value of losing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to these perceived incentives, the NBA further tweaked its lottery rules shortly before the start of the 2017–18 season. Effective with the 2019 draft, the teams with the three worst records will have equal odds of landing the #1 pick (barring one of said teams also owning another lottery team's pick), and the top four picks will be allocated in the lottery instead of the top three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Helin|first1=Kurt|title=NBA owners pass lottery reform, new rules on resting players|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/09/28/nba-owners-pass-lottery-reform-new-rules-on-resting-players/|website=ProBasketballTalk|accessdate=September 29, 2017|date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Football League]], the main competition of [[Australian rules football]], has used a system of [[priority draft pick]]s since [[1993 AFL Draft|1993]], with poorly performing teams receiving extra selections at or near the start of the draft. Prior to 2012, a team automatically received a priority pick if its win-loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria. However, that system led to accusations of tanking by several clubs—most notably by [[Melbourne Football Club tanking scandal|Melbourne in 2009]] (the club was found not guilty, but the head coach and general manager were found guilty on related charges). Since 2012, priority picks are awarded at the discretion of the [[AFL Commission]], the governing body of both the AFL and the overall sport.

Until the [[2014–15 NHL season]], the [[National Hockey League]] assured the last place team of at least the second position in its entry draft, with the first overall pick being subject to a draft lottery among the five worst teams. As NHL drafts typically include only one NHL-ready prospect, if any at all, in any given year (most others must continue developing in [[junior ice hockey]] or the [[minor league]]s for several years before reaching the NHL), this rudimentary lottery has historically been enough of a deterrent to avoid deliberate tanking. However, in 2014–15, two elite prospects widely considered to be “generational talents,” [[Connor McDavid]] and [[Jack Eichel]], were projected to enter the [[2015 NHL Entry Draft]], thus ensuring the last place team at least one of the two prospects. This was most prominent with the [[Buffalo Sabres]], whose fans openly rooted against their team in the hopes they would clinch last place in the league for much of the season (the Sabres themselves denied they were tanking and openly criticized their fans for suggesting the notion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=759960|title=Sabres unhappy after fans cheer Gagner's winning goal in OT that gives Coyotes 4-3 win|work=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2015–16, the top three picks in the draft will be subject to lottery, with all fourteen teams that did not qualify for the playoffs eligible to win the picks.

===More favorable schedule next year===

NFL teams have been accused of tanking games to obtain a more favorable schedule the following season; this was especially true between 1977 and 1993, when a team finishing last in a five-team division would get to play four of its eight non-division matches the next season against other last-place teams.

===Match fixing by referees===
In addition to the match fixing that is committed by players, coaches and/or team officials, it is not unheard of to have results manipulated by corrupt [[referee]]s.  Since 2004, separate [[scandal]]s have erupted in prominent sports leagues in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=519776&amp;&amp;cc=5901 |title=Porto chief up on referee bribery charges |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany ([[Bundesliga scandal (2005)|Bundesliga scandal]]), Brazil ([[Brazilian football match-fixing scandal]]) and the United States (see [[2007 NBA betting scandal|Tim Donaghy scandal]]), all of which concerned referees who fixed matches for gamblers.  Many sports writers have speculated that in leagues with high player salaries, it is far more likely for a referee to become corrupt since their pay in such competitions is usually much less than that of the players.

On December 2, 1896, former [[American frontier|Old West]] lawman [[Wyatt Earp]] refereed the [[Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey]] boxing match, promoted as the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|Heavyweight Championship of the World]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Arne K.|title=Prizefighting: An American History|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786436545|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ9CMH01BccC&amp;pg=PA237|accessdate=October 30, 2014|pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earp was chosen as referee by the National Athletic Association the afternoon of the match after both managers refused to agree on a choice. In the eighth round of a fight dominated by Fitzsimmons, Sharkey suddenly went down, clutching his groin, yelling foul. Referee Earp conferred with both corners for a few seconds before he disqualified Fitzsimmons for a foul that virtually no one saw.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt; Fitzsimmons went to court to attempt to stop Shakey from taking the purse, but failed when the court ruled that the match was illegal and it had no jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=rego2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rego|first1=Nilda|title=Days Gone By: Earp's controversial call gets upheld in court|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_14202746|website=Inside Bay Area|accessdate=October 24, 2014 |date=January 24, 2010|quote=Part 2 of 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee was arrested in Portland, Oregon. He had been accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee said, "I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair."&lt;ref name=sfcal1905&gt;{{cite news|title=Asserts He Fixed the Sharkey "Foul"|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1905-08-14/ed-1/seq-11/|accessdate=October 31, 2014|publisher=The San Francisco Call|date=August 14, 1905|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match fixing to a draw or a fixed score===
Match fixing does not necessarily involve deliberately losing a match. Occasionally, teams have been accused of deliberately playing to a draw or a fixed score where this ensures some mutual benefit (e.g. both teams advancing to the next stage of a competition.)  One of the earliest examples of this sort of match fixing in the modern era occurred in [[1897–98 Football League#Test matches 1898|1898]] when [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] intentionally drew in that year's final "test match" so as to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season.  In response, [[English Football League|the Football League]] expanded the divisions to 18 teams that year, thus permitting the intended victims of the fix ([[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]) to remain in the First Division.  The "test match" system was abandoned and replaced with automatic [[relegation]].

A more recent example occurred in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] played [[Austria national football team|Austria]] in [[Disgrace of Gijón|the last match of group B]]. A West German victory by 1 or 2 goals would result in both teams advancing; any less and Germany was out; any more and Austria was out (and replaced by [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], who had just beaten Chile).  West Germany attacked hard and scored after 10 minutes. Afterwards, the players then proceeded to just kick the ball around aimlessly for the remainder of the match. Algerian supporters were so angered that they waved banknotes at the players, while a German fan burned his German flag in disgust.&lt;ref name="Dodgiest game"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Lawrence |last1=Booth |first2=Rob |last2=Smyth |title=What's the dodgiest game in football history? |publisher=The Guardian |location=Manchester |date=2004-08-11 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/aug/11/theknowledge.sport |accessdate=2012-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the second half, the ARD commentator [[:de:Eberhard Stanjek|Eberhard Stanjek]] refused any further comment on the game, while the Austrian television commentator [[:de:Robert Seeger|Robert Seeger]] advised viewers to switch off their sets. As a result, [[FIFA]] changed its tournament scheduling for subsequent [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] so that the final pair of matches in each group are played simultaneously.

Another example took place on the next-to-last weekend of the [[1992–93 Serie A]] season. [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] entered their match with [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] needing only a point to secure the title ahead of crosstown rivals [[Inter Milan|Inter]], while Brescia believed a point would be enough for them to avoid relegation. In a 2004 retrospective on the "dodgiest games" in football history, two British journalists said about the match, "For over 80 minutes, the two teams engaged in a shameful game of cat-and-mouse, in which the cat appeared to have fallen asleep and the mouse was on tranquilisers." Milan scored in the 82nd minute, but Brescia "mysteriously found themselves with a huge overlap" and equalised two minutes later. The 1–1 draw gave Milan their title, but in the end did not help Brescia; other results went against them and they suffered the drop.&lt;ref name="Dodgiest game"/&gt;

In knockout competitions where the rules require drawn matches to be [[replay (sports)|replayed]], teams have sometimes been accused of intentionally playing one or more draws so as to ensure (a) replay(s). In this case, the motive is usually financial since the ensuing replay(s) would typically be expected to generate additional revenue for the participating teams. One notorious example of this particular type of alleged fix was the [[1909 Scottish Cup Final]], which sparked a riot after being played twice to a draw.

===Increased gate receipts===
In addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged fixing of drawn matches to ensure replays, mutual fixes have sometimes been alleged in "best of X" knockout series where draws are either not possible or very uncommon. Early versions of baseball's [[World Series]] were a common target of such allegations. Because the players received a percentage of the gate receipts for postseason games (a privilege they did not enjoy in the regular season), there was a perception that the players had an incentive to fix an equal number of early games in favor of each team so as to ensure the series would run the maximum number of games (or very close thereto). 

Partly as an effort to avoid this sort of controversy, early World Series sometimes saw all scheduled games played even if the Series winner was already determined. That did not prove satisfactory since few fans were willing to pay to watch [[wikt:lame duck|lame duck]] contests. Eventually, following the controversy at the 
conclusion of the 1904 season in which the [[New York Giants]] boycotted the World Series in part because of dissatisfaction with the financial arrangements surrounding the Series, Major League Baseball agreed to a number of reforms proposed by Giants owner [[John T. Brush]]. Among other things, the so-called "Brush Rules" stipulated that the players would only receive a share of ticket revenue from the first four games, thus eliminating any financial incentive for the players to deliberately prolong the World Series.

===Abuse of tie-breaking rules===
On several occasions, "creative" use of tie-breaking rules have allegedly led teams to play less than their best.

An example occurred in the [[2004 European Football Championship]]. Unlike [[FIFA]], [[UEFA]] takes the result of the game between the two tied teams (or in a three-way tie, the overall records of the games played with the teams in question only) into consideration before overall [[goal difference]] when ranking teams level on points, a situation arose in Group C where [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] played to a 2–2 draw, which was a sufficiently high scoreline to eliminate [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (which had lower-scoring draws with the Swedes and Danes) regardless of Italy's result with already-eliminated [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]].  Although Italy beat Bulgaria by only one goal to finish level with Sweden and Denmark on five points, and would hypothetically have been eliminated using the FIFA tie-breaker too, some Italian fans bitterly contended that the FIFA tie-breaker would have motivated their team to play harder and deterred their [[Scandinavia]]n rivals from, in their view, at the very least half-heartedly playing out the match after the score became 2–2.  The same situation happened to Italy in 2012, leading to many pre-game complaints from Italy, who many commentators suggested were right to be concerned because of their own extensive experience in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/italy-is-shocked-shocked-by-talk-of-a-fix/ |title=Italy Is Shocked — Shocked! — by Talk of a Fix |publisher=New York Times |date=18 June 2012 |author=Andrew Das }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Spain-Croatia ended up 1–0, and the Italians went through.

The FIFA tie-breaker, or any goal-differential scheme, can cause problems, too.  There have been incidents (especially in [[basketball]]) where players on a favored team have won the game but deliberately ensured the quoted [[point spread]] was not covered (see [[point shaving]]).  Conversely, there are cases where a team not only lost (which might be honest) but lost by some large amount, perhaps to ensure a point spread was covered, or to grant some non-gambling related favor to the victor. Perhaps the most famous alleged example was the match between Argentina and Peru in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. Argentina needed a four-goal victory to advance over Brazil, an enormous margin at this level of competition, especially since Argentina had a weak offense (6 goals in 5 games) and Peru a stout defence (6 goals allowed in 5 games). Yet somehow, Argentina won 6–0. Much was made over political collusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We fixed it! Peru senator claims 1978 World Cup game against Argentina was rigged |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2098970/Argentina-cheated-World-Cup-1978-says-Peru-senator.html |date=9 Feb 2012 |publisher=Daily Mail |author=Matt Roper |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Peruvian goalkeeper was born in Argentina, and that Peru was dependent on Argentinian grain shipments, but nothing was ever proven.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/bungs-and-bribes-football-cant-kick-this-habit-1611274.html Bungs and bribes football can't kick this habit] (retrieved 12 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Denmark–Sweden game above led to calls for UEFA to adopt FIFA's tiebreaking formula for future tournaments, it is not clear if this solves the problem; the Argentina-Peru game shows a possible abuse of the FIFA tie-breaker. Proponents of the UEFA tie-breaker argue that it reduces the value of ''blow-outs'', whether these be the result of a much stronger team ''running up the score'' or an already-eliminated side allowing an unusually large number of goals. Perhaps the most infamous incident occurred in December 1983 when [[Spain national football team|Spain]], needing to win by eleven goals to qualify for the [[1984 European Football Championship|Euro 1984]] ahead of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], defeated [[Malta national football team|Malta]] by a score of 12–1 on the strength of ''nine'' second half goals. Especially in [[association football|international football]], such lopsided results are seen as unsavoury, even if they are honest. If anything, these incidents serves as evidence that the FIFA tie-breaker can cause incentives to perpetrate a fix in some circumstances, the UEFA tie-breaker in others.

Tie-breaking rules played the central role in one of [[cricket]]'s more notorious matches. In a [[1979 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup|1979]] [[Worcestershire v Somerset, 1979|match]] in England's now-defunct [[Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]], a [[Limited overs cricket|one-day]] league, [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] hosted [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in the final group match for both sides. Going into that match, Somerset led their group with three wins from three matches, but would end in a three-way tie for the top spot if they lost to Worcestershire and [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] defeated the then-winless [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor Counties South]]. In that event, the tie-breaker would be bowling [[strike rate]]. The Somerset players calculated that a large enough loss could see them miss the quarter-finals. Accordingly, Somerset captain [[Brian Rose (cricketer)|Brian Rose]] determined that if Somerset batted first and declared their innings closed after one over, they would protect their strike rate advantage, assuring advancement to the quarter-finals. When Somerset won the toss, Rose implemented the plan, batting in the first partnership and declaring at the close of the first over after Somerset scored only one run on a no-ball.  Worcestershire won during their second over. Rose's strategy, although not against the letter of the rules, was condemned by media and cricket officials, and the [[Test and County Cricket Board]] (predecessor to the current [[England and Wales Cricket Board]]) voted to expel Somerset from that season's competition.

===Prize sharing===
A player can concede with the understanding that the opponent will share the prize equally with him or her. Depending on the game, this can lead to disqualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://blogs.magicjudges.org/whatsupdocs/2013/11/01/unsporting-conduct-improperly-determining-a-winner-and-bribery/|title=Unsporting Conduct — Improperly Determining a Winner and Bribery|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest action===
On occasion, teams tank games as a protest against actions in earlier games. The most lopsided professional football match in history, [[AS Adema 149–0 SO l'Emyrne]], was a result of SO l'Emyrne intentionally losing the game in protest against the referee's action in a previous game.

===Individual performance in team sports===
Bookmakers in the early 21st century accept bets on a far wider range of sports-related propositions than ever before. Thus, a gambling-motivated fix might not necessarily involve any direct attempt to influence the outright result, especially in team sports where such a fix would require the co-operation (and prerequsitely, the knowledge) of many people, and/or perhaps would be more likely to arouse suspicion. Fixing the result of a more particular proposition might be seen as less likely to be noticed. For example, disgraced former [[National Basketball Association]] referee [[Tim Donaghy]] has been alleged to have perpetrated some of his fixes by calling games in such a manner as to ensure more points than expected were scored by both teams, thus affecting "[[over-under]]" bets on the games whilst also ensuring that Donaghy at least did not look to be outright [[bias]]ed. Also, bets are increasingly being taken on individual performances in team sporting events, which in turn has seen the rise of a phenomenon known as [[spot fixing]], although it is currently unlikely that enough is bet on an average player to allow someone to place a substantial wager on them without being noticed.

One such attempt was described by retired footballer [[Matthew Le Tissier]], who in 2009 admitted that while he was playing with [[Southampton FC]] back in 1995 he tried (and failed) to kick the ball out of play right after the kick-off of a [[Premier League]] match against [[Wimbledon FC]] so that a group of associates would collect on a wager made on an early throw-in.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gXi4gCHhureGn65aDhekC5DP2uhw]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917183730/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gXi4gCHhureGn65aDhekC5DP2uhw |date=September 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|in 2010]], Pakistani cricket players were accused of committing specific [[no-ball]] penalties for the benefit of gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan embroiled in no-ball betting scandal against England |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/29/pakistan-cricket-betting-allegations |date=29 August 2010 |publisher=The Observer, UK |location=London |first=Vic |last=Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scandal centred on three Pakistani players accepting bribes from a bookmaker, [[Mazhar Majeed]] during the Lord's test match against England. Following investigations by the News of the World and Scotland Yard, on 1 November 2011, Majeed, Pakistan's captain, [[Salman Butt]], [[Mohammad Asif]] and [[Mohammad Amir]] were found guilty of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments.

As a result, all three of the players were banned by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC); Butt for ten years, Asif for seven and Amir for five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2016/07/12/pakistan-spot-fixing-shame-the-inside-story-on-the-day-the-home/|title=Pakistan spot-fixing shame: The inside story on the day the home of cricket became engulfed in scandal|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months for Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years eight months for Majeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15573463|title=Salman Butt and Pakistan bowlers jailed for no-ball plot|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of non-gambling-motivated fixing on wagering===

Whenever any serious motivation for teams to manipulate results becomes apparent to the general public, there can be a corresponding effect on betting markets as honest gamblers speculate in [[good faith]] as to the chance such a fix might be attempted.  Some bettors might choose to avoid wagering on such a fixture while others will be motivated to wager on it, or alter the bet they would otherwise place.  Such actions will invariably affect [[odds]] and [[point spread]]s even if there is no contact whatsoever between teams and the relevant gambling interests.  The rise of [[betting exchange]]s has allowed such speculation to play out in real time.

==History==

Since gambling pre-dates recorded history it comes as little surprise that evidence of match fixing is found throughout recorded history. The [[ancient Olympic Games]] were almost constantly dealing with allegations of [[sportsperson|athlete]]s accepting [[bribery|bribes]] to lose a competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/the-fix-was-in-for-ancient-wrestling-match-140417.htm |title=The Fix Was in for Ancient Wrestling Match
|date=Apr 17, 2014 |author=Owen Jarus |publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[city-states]] which often tried to manipulate the outcome with large amounts of money. These activities went on despite the [[oath]] each athlete took to protect the integrity of the events and the severe punishment sometimes inflicted on those who were caught. [[Chariot racing]] was also dogged by race fixing throughout its history.

By the end of the 19th century gambling was illegal in most jurisdictions, but that did not stop its widespread practice. [[Boxing]] soon became rife with fighters "taking a dive", likely due to boxing being a sport involving individual competitors, which makes its matches much easier to fix without getting caught. [[Baseball]] also became plagued by match fixing despite efforts by the [[National League]] to stop gambling at its games.  Matters finally came to a head in 1919 when eight members of the [[Chicago White Sox]] threw the [[World Series]] (see [[Black Sox Scandal]]). In an effort to restore confidence, [[Major League Baseball]] established the office of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], and one of [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]'s first acts was to ban all involved players for life.

MLB Rule 21 prohibits players from participating in any form of betting on baseball games, and a lifetime ban on betting on a player's own games.  A poster with Rule 21 must be posted on all professional baseball clubhouses.

===Japan===
{{further|Match fixing in professional sumo}}
{{nihongo|''Yaochō''|八百長}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning a cheating activity which is committed at places where a match, fight, game, competition, or other contest, is held, where the winner and loser are decided in advance by agreement of the competitors or related people. It is believed that the word ''Yaocho'' came from the name ("Chobei") of the owner of a vegetable stand (''yaoya'') during the [[Meiji period]].  Created from the first syllable of ''Yaoya'' and ''chobei'', the word ''yaocho'' was created for a nickname of Chobei. Chobei had a friend called "Isenoumi Godayu" (7th [[Isenoumi stable|Isenoumi]] stablemaster) with whom he played the game [[Go (board game)|Igo]], who had once been a [[sumo]] wrestler "Kashiwado Sogoro" (former ''[[shikona]]'': "Kyonosato") and now was a "''[[toshiyori]]''" (a stablemaster of sumo).  Although Chobei was a better Igo player than Isenoumi, he sometimes lost games on purpose to please Isenoumi, so that Isenoumi would continue to buy merchandise from his shop.  Afterward, once people knew of his cheating, they started to use ''yaocho'' as a word meaning any decision to win/lose a match in advance by negotiation etc. with the expectation of secondary profit, even though the match seems to be held seriously and fairly.

Economists, using statistical analysis, have shown very strong evidence of bout fixing in [[sumo]] wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DugganLevitt2002.pdf |title=Winning Isn’t Everything: Corruption in Sumo Wrestling |author =MARK DUGGAN AND STEVEN D. LEVITT |publisher= THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW |date=December 2002|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the motive for match fixing is helping each other's ranking to keep their salary higher, according to [[Keisuke Itai]]. For example, wrestlers in ''[[jūryō]]'' (the second tier) desperately try to avoid finishing the tournament [[makekoshi|with a losing record (7–8 or worse)]] and exchange or buy the match result otherwise their salary would be nothing, literally 0 yen, with the participation wage of 150,000 yen every two months if they finish the tournament with a losing record, and their ranking would go down to ''[[makushita]]'' (third level) and only participate in seven matches, the lesser ranking from ''[[jūryō]]'' in which one can earn 1,036,000 yen monthly with some prizes and a full 15-match tournament.

The sumo association appears to make a distinction between ''yaocho'' (the payment of money to secure a result) and ''koi-ni-yatta mukiryoku zumo'' (the deliberate performance of underpowered sumo, whereby an opponent simply lays a match down without exchange of money). The intricacies of Japanese culture, which include subordination of individual gain to the greater good, and knowing how to read a situation without the exchange of words (i.e. I know my opponent's score, he needs help and I should automatically give it to him), mean that the latter is almost readily accepted in the sumo world, and is also nigh-impossible to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/Sumo-through-Wrestlers-Eyes-ebook/dp/B006C1I5K8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322241344&amp;sr=1-1 | title=Sumo Through the Wrestlers' Eyes | first = Chris | last = Gould | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional wrestling===
{{Main article|Kayfabe}}
In [[professional wrestling]], most matches have predetermined results; however, as it is an [[open secret]] that professional wrestling is staged, it is not considered match fixing.

Up until the 1920s, professional wrestling was a legitimate sport. This did not endure as professional wrestling became identified with modern theatrics or ''admitted fakery'' ("[[kayfabe]]"), moving away from actual competition. The [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|worked]] nature of the art have made critics consider it an illegitimate sport, particularly in comparison to [[boxing]], [[amateur wrestling]], and, in more recent times, [[mixed martial arts]].

Many individuals began to doubt the legitimacy of wrestling after the retirement of [[Frank Gotch]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thesz|first=Lou|title=Hooker|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As wrestling's popularity was diving around the same time that [[Major League Baseball]] [[Black Sox Scandal|had its own legitimacy issues]], wrestling started to take on a more worked approach while still appearing as a legitimate sport, beginning with the [[Gold Dust Trio]] of the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hooker-pg45/&gt; Even after the formation of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1948, wrestling continued to have legitimacy issues.

Nevertheless, wrestling was still regulated by state athletic commissions in the [[United States]] well into the 1980s, until [[Vince McMahon]], owner of the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], convinced the state of [[New Jersey]] in 1989 that wrestling was considered a form of entertainment (or [[sports entertainment]], as McMahon used) rather than as a legitimate sport, and that it should not be regulated by state athletic commissions.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/3/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023145255/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/3/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2009 |work=Sports Illustrated |title=Wrestling with Success |date=25 March 1991 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was seen as more of a relief to those who had questioned wrestling's legitimacy, since at least one major company (in this case, the WWF) was now publicly willing to admit that wrestling was staged; however, the move did anger many wrestling purists.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

Today, despite the staged aspects of wrestling, it is still seen as a legitimate sport in several countries, such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United Kingdom]], while it is seen as a form of entertainment in the [[United States]] similar to that of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. Due to the lingering legitimacy issues that surrounded wrestling from the 1910s until the 1980s, gambling was generally not allowed on wrestling matches while it was still considered a legitimate sport. Despite wrestling having openly acknowledged that the results are predetermined for years, since the late 2000s gambling has increased on wrestling events, though the maximum bets are kept low due to the matches being predetermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/5788844/the-quirks-of-gambling-on-professional-wrestling|title=The Quirks Of Gambling On Professional Wrestling|author=Barry Petchesky|work=Deadspin|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/a-redditor-has-been-leaking-wwe-outcomes-update-wwe-r-787445495|title=A Redditor Has Been Leaking WWE Outcomes [Update: WWE Response]|author=Barry Petchesky|work=Deadspin|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quiz shows ===
{{main|Quiz show scandals}}
In the 1950's, televised [[quiz show]]s in the United States became the center of a match fixing controversy. At the time, the majority of television programs were effectively controlled by their single sponsors, with broadcasters only providing studios and airtime. 

[[Geritol]]—the sponsor of the new quiz show ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]''—was unimpressed by the program, which also struggled in the ratings in comparison to ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''. The company demanded that its producer, [[Barry &amp; Enright Productions]], make changes to ''Twenty-One'' to boost viewer interest and [[Audience measurement|ratings]]. A decision was made to replace the show's current champion, [[Herbert Stempel]], in favor of [[Charles Van Doren]]—a [[Columbia University]] English teacher whom the producers felt would be a more popular contestant—by instructing Stempel to lose his match to his new opponent. In an effort to build hype for the episode where Van Doren would win, the first episode of their match was played to three tie games. Winners of matches received $500 for every point within their margin of victory, but this increased by $500 after every tie game; promotion for the next episode on December 5, 1956 duly-noted that the contestants would be playing for $2,000 per-point. 

In the ensuing episode, after one more tie game, Stempel threw the match to Van Doren as planned. Among the questions Stempel was specifically instructed to answer incorrectly, he guessed  tthat ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' was the winner of [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[28th Academy Awards]]. The correct answer was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', which was also one of Stempel's favorite films. The cancellation of another quiz show, ''[[Dotto]]'', under allegations of rigging, prompted a U.S. government investigation into both shows. The investigation had similarly revealed that [[Revlon]]—the sponsor of ''The $64,000 Question''—had instructed the show's producers to [[Game balance|balance]] the game more favorably towards contestants they felt would be more popular among viewers. The scandal resulted in regulations being implemented to prohibit the rigging of game shows and other contests by broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652498304|title=Television fraud : the history and implications of the quiz show scandals|last=1946-|first=Anderson, Kent,|date=1978|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313389467|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=652498304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/history/2014/12/10/who-cheats-on-a-quiz-show-how-the-1950s-quiz-show-scandals-shaped-tv|title=Who Cheats on a Quiz Show?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92534">A '''perfect season''' is a sports [[season (sports)|season]] including any requisite playoff portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated and untied. The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A '''perfect regular season''' (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season ''excluding'' any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.

A perfect season may be part of a multi-season [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]].

[[Exhibition game]]s are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason ("exhibition" games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season.

==American football==

===National Football League===
{{Main|1972 Miami Dolphins season}}
Since the [[National Football League]] began in [[1920 NFL season|1920]], only one team has played a complete perfect season (both regular season and playoffs): [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the 1972 Miami Dolphins]], who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including [[Super Bowl VII]], to finish the season 17–0–0.

The Dolphins briefly extended their winning streak before losing to [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] on September 23, 1973. It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season, either gather to drink champagne when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. The head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, [[Don Shula]], denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|title=Shoes ... The Jaw ... by any name, Shula still the king|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=2750571|publisher=ESPN|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, President [[Barack Obama]] hosted the 1972 Dolphins noting that they "never got their [[White House]] visit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er3z00blcec&amp;t=1m |title=President Obama Honors the 1973 Super Bowl Champion Miami Dolphins  |publisher=YouTube.com/user/whitehouse |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NFL undefeated seasons (with ties) prior to 1932====
Prior to the development of a playoff system in the NFL in [[1932 NFL season|1932]], there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated, but with one or more tied games: [[1920 Akron Pros season|the 1920 Akron Pros]], [[1922 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1922 Canton Bulldogs]], [[1923 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1923 Canton Bulldogs]], and [[1929 Green Bay Packers season|the 1929 Green Bay Packers]]. According to the 2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book, under NFL practices at the time, from 1920 to 1971 tie games were not included in winning percentage (there was also no [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to settle ties in the regular season until 1974) so, these four teams were recorded with perfect win percentages of 1.000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | title=2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book | publisher=NFL | accessdate=18 September 2013 | pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1921 Buffalo All-Americans season|The 1921 Buffalo All-Americans]] were controversially denied a similar type of near-undefeated season, when they believed that their final game, [[Staley Swindle|a 10-7 loss to the Chicago Staleys]], was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings; the NFL records that game as official, and Buffalo's record as 9–1–2.

====Other NFL perfect regular seasons====
{{Main|1934 Chicago Bears season|1942 Chicago Bears season|2007 New England Patriots season}}
Apart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: [[1934 Chicago Bears season|the 1934 Chicago Bears]], [[1942 Chicago Bears season|the 1942 Chicago Bears]], and [[2007 New England Patriots season|the 2007 New England Patriots]].

In 1934, the Bears played a 13–0–0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an undefeated regular season without tied games, but lost the [[1934 NFL Championship Game]] against [[1934 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]]. Despite losing several players and head coach [[George Halas]] to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished 11–0–0 but again lost the [[1942 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], this time against [[1942 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]].

The 2007 Patriots became the first team after the NFL expanded its regular season to sixteen games in [[1978 NFL season|1978]] to finish the regular season undefeated. The Patriots then won their divisional and conference playoff games, but were upset by [[2007 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]], giving them a final record of 18–1.

===Pre-NFL era and competing leagues===
NFL predecessors such as the [[Ohio League]], [[New York Pro Football League]] and [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]]  had many perfect seasons. In Ohio, the [[Massillon Tigers]] (1904, 1905), [[Akron Indians]] (1909), [[Shelby Blues]] (1911), and [[Dayton Triangles]] (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. In New York, the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Niagaras]] went 5–0–0 (6–0–0 including a forfeit) in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. In 1920, the [[Union Club of Phoenixville]], located in eastern Pennsylvania, played in a league mostly consisting of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a [[mythical national championship]]. In western Pennsylvania, the [[1900 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1900]] and [[1901 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1901]] Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams, as well as the 1903 [[Franklin Athletic Club]], all had perfect seasons.

The caliber of talent was neither as high nor as consistent between teams at the time, the seasons were generally shorter (7 to 11 games), and it was not uncommon for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.

====1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs====
The [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] were a member of the [[American Football League (1936)|second American Football League]], who joined the league in 1937 after the [[Cleveland Rams]] defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the [[Providence Steam Roller]] and the [[Salinas Packers]]), the team went 16–0, with 8 of those wins coming against AFL teams. The Bulldogs’ dominance is cited as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and the next season as an independent with a 10–2–2 record including a 2–1–2 record against NFL teams, several of the team's players were invited to play on the "Pro All Stars" team in the NFL's first [[Pro Bowl|Pro All-Star Game]] in Los Angeles. The Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.

====1948 Cleveland Browns====
The [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] were a member of the [[All-America Football Conference]], a professional football league that played from 1946 to 1949.  In 1948, the Browns won all fourteen regular season games and the [[All-America Football Conference#1948|1948 AAFC championship]] to post a 15–0–0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a longer string of 29 straight wins, which stretched from 1947 to 1949 and included both the 1947 and 1948 title games.  Overall, the Browns won all four AAFC championship games and were accepted into the NFL when the two leagues merged after the 1949 season.

Neither the NFL nor the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] recognizes the Bulldogs’ perfect season; the Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns’ perfect season but the NFL does not.

===Close to perfect===
Since the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties (or better) while failing to achieve a perfect season:

|}

Most of these teams suffered their regular-season loss early in the year and, other than the 2007 Patriots (finished regular season 16–0), only the 1962 Packers (10–0), 1985 Bears (12–0),  2011 Packers (13–0), and 2015 Panthers (14–0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears’ lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.

The best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Indianapolis Colts]], who started 14–0 before losing their final two regular season games to the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] to finish 14–2, and the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who went 14–0 before losing to the [[2015 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] and going on to finish the regular season 15–1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead [[resting the starters|rested their starters]] the final two games to protect them for the playoffs. The Colts would go on to [[Super Bowl XLIV]] but lost to the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] were 13–2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).

Four other teams have started 13–0 before losing their fourteenth game: the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]], [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005 Indianapolis Colts]], [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 New Orleans Saints]] and [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2011 Packers are the only team that did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The [[1953 Cleveland Browns season|1953 Cleveland Browns]] and [[1969 Los Angeles Rams season|1969 Los Angeles Rams]] started 11–0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgeography.com/?p=3190|title=Last Undefeated NFL Team(s) in Each Season » FootballGeography.com|website=www.footballgeography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other leagues===
The following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:

*The Hollywood Bears, a member of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], went 8–0–0 in 1941.
*The Hollywood Rangers were a member of the [[American Football League (1944)|American Football League of 1944]] (formerly the Northwest War Industries League), a short-lived competitor to the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] on the West Coast. In their 1944 season, they went 11–0–0 and defeated the PCPFL champion San Diego Bombers (who had also had a perfect season in their league, going 9–0–0) in a two-game series.
*The Charleston Rockets of the [[Continental Football League]] won all 14 games of the league's inaugural season in 1965, going on to defeat the [[Toronto Rifles]] in the league's championship.
*The Hartford Knights went 17–0–0 in 1972 as a member of the [[Seaboard Football League]], including a victory over the [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] in the league's championship. The Knights, unhappy with the level of competition (many of the Knights games had margins of victory of 40 points or more), quit the league the following year.

In [[indoor American football|indoor football]], the following teams have had perfect seasons:

*The [[Quad City Steamwheelers]] went undefeated in the [[2000 AF2 season|inaugural season]] of [[AF2|arenafootball2]], accruing a record of 19–0–0 including playoffs and an [[ArenaCup I]] win.
*The [[Ohio Valley Greyhounds]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] accrued a perfect season in 2003.
*The [[Sioux Falls Storm]] of [[United Indoor Football]] won back-to-back perfect seasons in 2006 and 2007, winning the United Bowl championship both years.
*The [[Fayetteville Guard]] won a perfect season in 2007 in the NIFL.
*The [[Rochester Raiders]] won a perfect season in [[2008 Continental Indoor Football League season|2008]] in the [[Continental Indoor Football League]], but withdrew from that league during the playoffs in a dispute.
*The [[Baltimore Mariners]] won a perfect season in [[2010 American Indoor Football Association season|2010]] in the [[American Indoor Football Association]].
*The [[Erie Explosion]] won a perfect season in [[2013 Erie Explosion season|2013]] in the Continental Indoor Football league, winning all ten regular season games, a semifinal playoff, and the CIFL Championship.

At least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Brainerd (2010). [http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teamgame.htm Minor league football records - Winning streaks].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the [[American Association (football)|American Association]], [[World Football League]], [[United States Football League]], [[XFL]], or, to date, the [[Arena Football League]]. The [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] has had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: [[2009 Florida Tuskers season|the 2009 Florida Tuskers]] finished 6–0, but that team lost the subsequent [[2009 UFL Championship Game|championship game]]; the [[2012 Las Vegas Locomotives season|2012 Las Vegas Locomotives]] had a record of 4–0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season.

The 1933 [[Providence Huskies]] (possibly a successor to the [[Providence Steam Roller]]) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teampnts.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Points Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leagues outside North America===
In the [[2014 German Football League]] the [[Braunschweig Lions]] compiled a perfect season (12–0 postseason 3–0), losing only in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the [[2016 German Football League]] the [[Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns]] achieved a perfect regular season with a 14–0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Schwäbisch Hall ultimately lost the [[German Bowl]], in this case to Braunschweig. In the [[2017 German Football League]] season, Schwäbisch Hall once more compiled a perfect season (14-0) but this time also won the [[German Bowl]], again against Braunschweig. Interestingly, their opponent in the final had also entered the game with a 14-0 regular season record.

==Canadian football==
A true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]], has completed a perfect regular season.

The current [[Canadian Football League]] schedule would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record.

===1948 Calgary Stampeders===
Under head coach [[Les Lear]], the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]] completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12–0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14–0–1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=208] Grey Cup History (CFL.ca), Accessed December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]] championship (a home-and-home [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]] series decided on total points) against the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|Regina Roughriders]], the first leg was tied 4–4, and the Stampeders won the second 21–10, to win the aggregate 25–14. The Stampeders then defeated the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 12–7 for the [[36th Grey Cup]].

Despite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and only met in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition in the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.

==Lacrosse==
In professional [[lacrosse]], the [[1993 MILL season|1993]] [[Buffalo Bandits]] are the only team to have won a perfect season in the [[National Lacrosse League]]. The Bandits won all ten of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits’ successful run for the [[1992 MILL season|previous year's]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/07/three-former-bandits-among-six-nominated-for-nll-hall.html |title=Three former Bandits among six nominated for NLL Hall – Sports, Ink &amp;#124; The Buffalo News |publisher=Blogs.buffalonews.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Major League Lacrosse]], which began play in 2001, [[2013 Denver Outlaws season|the 2013 Denver Outlaws]] were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/lacrosse/ci_23837209/denver-outlaws-beat-hamilton-finish-season-undefeated-at ‘Denver Outlaws beat Hamilton, finish season undefeated at 14–0’]; ''[[Denver Post]]'', 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After beating [[2013 Hamilton Nationals season|the Hamilton Nationals]], the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing [[2012 MLL season|the 2012 championship]]. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs [[2013 Charlotte Hounds season|to the Charlotte Hounds]], who had only gone 7–7 in the regular season.

==Other North American professional sports leagues==
In North America's three other major professional sports leagues ([[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]]) it is almost impossible for a team to play a “perfect” season, primarily because there are substantially more games in the regular season (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball). The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]‘s season has been between 28 and 34 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.

It is possible for a baseball [[pitcher]] to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1171) were 1–0 seasons, mostly by [[relief pitcher]]s. The best perfect season belongs to [[Tom Zachary]] of the 1929 [[New York Yankees]], who posted a 12–0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the [[Earned run average|ERA]] title.

In the NBA, the [[1985–86 NBA season|1985–86]] [[1985–86 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] played a nearly perfect home season. During the regular season, they were 40–1 (.976) in front of their home crowd. The [[Boston Celtics|Celtics']] only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to [[1985–86 Portland Trail Blazers season|the Portland Trail Blazers]], by the score of 121–103. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason, to finish 50–1 at home. The [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] also played a nearly perfect home regular-season with a 40-1 (.976) record in front of their home crowd, with their only home loss occurring on April 10, 2016 vs. the [[Golden State Warriors]] by the score of 92-86. The Spurs were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the [[2016 NBA Playoffs]].  The Spurs played a total of 5 home games in the post season, finishing 43-3 at home, losing twice to the Thunder. The three-on-three basketball league [[BIG3]], which featured an eight-game regular season and two-round playoff, had a perfect team in its inaugural season when [[Trilogy (basketball)|Trilogy]] swept all ten games on their schedule.

===Individual professional sports===
For other sports leagues for individuals, such as the [[PGA Tour]] or [[NASCAR]], a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.

Golf instead considers the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]], a sweep of the four [[men's major golf championships]] deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection. The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] won all four majors (at the time, [[The Amateur Championship|The (British) Amateur Championship]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] were still considered majors); since 1934, when [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. [[Tiger Woods]] is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set [[Byron Nelson]] in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.

In [[Formula One]], [[Michael Schumacher]] was the 2004 champion with 13 wins in 18 races. In IndyCar, [[A. J. Foyt]] won 10 out of 13 races. In [[NASCAR]], [[Richard Petty|Richard "The King" Petty]] holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of them consecutive. Since a format change in 1972, Petty also holds the modern-era record for most wins in a season, with 13, a record he shares with [[Jeff Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite book|title=Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black|last=Hinton|first=Ed|year=2001|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-52677-0|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional motorcycle racer [[Ricky Carmichael]] had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004. In 1997, [[road racing|road racer]] [[Tommy Kendall]] started the 13-race [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[Trans-Am Series]] season 11–0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing.&lt;ref name="Deepthrottle"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th race, he was battling for the lead on the final lap, but spun out and finished second. The feat would be extremely difficult in NASCAR, because of the length of the season (currently 36 races).

==American collegiate sports==

=== NAIA Football ===
In 1966 Waynesburg College went 11–0 after a 9–0 regular season record.
In December 1966 Waynesburg defeated New Mexico Highlands in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the playoff game, 
and, defeated Whitewater Wisconsin in the NAIA Champion Bowl at Tulsa Oklahoma.
This was, and still is a college football rarity. 
Very few college football teams have won a College National Football Championship (including playoff games)
with an undefeated  record.

===NCAA Football===
{{Main|List of undefeated NCAA Division I football teams}}
Due to relatively short seasons through most of [[college football]] history, the [[List of undefeated NCAA Division I football teams|list of undefeated Division I football teams]] includes dozens of teams.&lt;ref name=Dolphin&gt;[http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/ Dolphin Historical Football Rankings] Retrieved December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest level of college football, the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (introduced as Division I-A in 1978), did not use a playoff to determine a champion prior to the introduction of the four-team [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP) in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. The system replaced by the CFP relied on a combination of polls and computer rankings to choose two teams to play one [[BCS National Championship Game|title game]] in a system known as the [[Bowl Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcsfootball.org/ Home page of the Bowl Championship Series]

The record for most wins in an undefeated FBS season is 14–0, accomplished in 2002 by [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], twice in [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]] by [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] and [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], in [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010]] by [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]] by [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]].

===NCAA Division I Basketball===

====Men====
Before the establishment of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1938 and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.

Eight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:
* [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|1939 LIU Blackbirds]] (24–0) — [[1939 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champion, which at the time was more prestigious than the NCAA tournament
* [[1955–56 San Francisco Dons men's basketball team|1956 San Francisco Dons]] (29–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|1957 North Carolina Tar Heels]] (32–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1963–64 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1964 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1966–67 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1967 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1971–72 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1972 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1973 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976 Indiana Hoosiers]] (32–0) – NCAA champion

In addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:
* 1940 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] (19–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT.
* 1944 [[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army Cadets]] (15–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT. (Given that this season was during World War II, it is also possible that Army chose to turn down tournament invitations.)

The 1955–56 Clarkson Golden Knights were undefeated and untied (23–0–0), but skipped the NCAA tournament because as the team had seniors with four years of college play which was against NCAA tournament rules at the time (not regular season rules).

The [[Australian Football League|VFL]] began in 1897. Based entirely in the state of Victoria, before it expanded through the 1980s, and 1990s to become the top level national league (AFL) in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, {{AFL Col}} in [[1929 VFL season|1929]], completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18–0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the [[Second amended Argus system|second semi-final]] against {{AFL Ric}}.

===South Australian National Football League (SANFL)===
{{main|1914 Port Adelaide Football Club season}}
The SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia, and until the latter part of the twentieth century was of equivalent standard to the VFL. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]] team, known as the "Invincibles". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12–0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14–0 record and a perfect season.

The closest any team got to Port Adelaide was [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]], losing by 21 points in Round 10. This is the only instance in [[The Big Three (Australian football)|The Big Three]] Australian football leagues (VFL/SANFL/WAFL) where a club has gone undefeated in the pre-season, season main and post season.

In 1912, Port Adelaide had a perfect minor round and then beat [[West Torrens Football Club|West Torrens]] in its semi-final but lost both the final and Grand Final to [[West Adelaide Football Club|West Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1912|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1912 results|accessdate=28 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Australian Football League (WAFL)===
The [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] has existed since 1885 within Western Australia, and until the latter part of the 20th century was of equivalent standard to either the VFL or SANFL. The [[1946 WANFL season|1946]] [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] team was the first club in senior WAFL football{{efn| In the [[1944 WANFL season|1944 under-19 wartime competition]] that replaced the senior competition between [[1942 WANFL season|1942]] and that season due to the player drain of World War II, [[East Perth Football Club|East Perth]] managed a perfect season, winning all nineteen home-and-away games plus two finals.}} to have managed a perfect season or even a perfect home-and-away season, winning all twenty-one of its games; it is noted that the playing lists of many of its opponents had been seriously depleted by World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Devaney, John; ''Full Points Footy's WA Football Companion''; pp. 69-70. {{ISBN|9780955689710}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only loss for the season came against Collingwood in a post season match.

===Victorian Football Association (VFA/VFL)===
The Victorian Football League, known until 1996 as the Victorian Football Association, began in 1877 and was Victoria's premier football league until 1897, and has been the second-tier league in the state since. Perfect seasons have been completed on four occasions in VFA/VFL history:
#by [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] during a war-shortened [[1915 VFA season|1915]], with a record of 15–0

There were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, {{AFL Gee}} could be interpreted as having been perfect in [[1879 VFA season|1879]]; it had a record of 15–0–1, and the draw came by agreement when a match was abandoned due to inclement weather.&lt;ref name="review1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=18 October 1879|title=The Football Season of 1879 – Part 1|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=493|issue=707|volume=XXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five other teams have gone undefeated but featured at least one drawn match: [[Wests Tigers|Balmain]] ([[1915 NSWRFL season|1915]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1915|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1915.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514040757/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1915.html|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] ([[1921 NSWRFL season|1921]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1921|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1921.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191321/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1921.html|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] ([[1936 NSWRFL season|1936]] and [[1937 NSWRFL season|1937]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1936|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1936.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415193223/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1936.html|archivedate=2011-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1937|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1937.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415070403/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1937.html|archivedate=2011-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St George-Illawarra Dragons|St George]] ([[1959 NSWRFL season|1959]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1959|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1959.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191602/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1959.html|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Brisbane Rugby League===
The [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the [[Queensland Cup]]. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before [[World War II]] seasons were typically no more than twelve games long; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games by 1960. The only BRL teams to manage a perfect season were:

===British Rugby League===
Whilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on two occasions in lower divisions, once in the 2nd division and once in the 3rd. [[Hull F.C.]] achieved this feat in the [[1978–79 Northern Rugby Football League season|1978–79 Season]], where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the [[Dewsbury Rams]] in [[2009 Championship 1|2009]] during their [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship 1]] (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes.

In [[2017 League 1|2017]], the [[Toronto Wolfpack]] completed the regular reason with a perfect 15–0 record, however after the [[2017 League 1 results#Super 8s|Super 8s]] finished with a 22-1-1 record.

==Rugby union==

===International Rugby===
The [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]] were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated {{nrut|France}} four times, {{nrut|Australia}} three times, {{nrut|South Africa}} and {{nrut|Argentina}} twice and also beat {{nrut|Japan}}, {{nrut|England}} and {{nrut|Ireland}} in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14–0–0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. {{nrut|England}} have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 after recovering from getting knocked out of their own [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]].

===Super Rugby===
The Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, [[Super Rugby]], established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]], based in [[Christchurch]] and representing a large portion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, finished the [[2002 Super 12 season]] with an 11–0–0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.

One other team has won a championship unbeaten: in [[1997 Super 12 season|1997]], the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] (known simply as "Blues" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the [[Auckland]] area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.

==Association football==

===Domestic teams===
Many [[association football]] teams have also had perfect seasons, however doing so in a season of 20 or more matches is very rare. Clubs to have achieved this include: [[Dresdner SC]] of Germany in 1942–43 (23 wins out of 23), [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencvárosi]] of Hungary in 1931–32 (22), [[Sunrise Flacq United]] of [[Mauritius]] in 1995–96 (22), and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] of [[Uruguay]] in 1941 (20).&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html |title=Unbeaten |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ahly]] (of Egypt) hold the record of going a whole season being unbeaten, in all possible competitions they were involved in (46 matches in total played in: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, Egyptian Super Cup and CAF Champions League between 2005 and 2006). The longest winning streak of any team over multiple seasons was [[Sparta Prague]]'s run of at least 51 wins in a row, between 1920 and 1923.&lt;ref name="rsssf"/&gt;

Teams finishing a season unbeaten (i.e. having won or drawn every match) are more common. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 English Premier League season]], finished with no losses from 38 games over 100 years after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] unbeaten streak in 22 league games and all of its FA Cup games in [[1888–89 in English football|1888–89]]. At the same time, AFC Wimbledon finished with a [[2003–04 AFC Wimbledon season|record]] of 42 wins, 4 draws and 0 defeats out of 46 games in their [[Combined Counties League Premier Division]] season. In Belgium, From 1933 to 1935  [[Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]]  played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In Italy, [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] ([[1978–79 Serie A|1978–79]]), [[A.C. Milan]] ([[1991–92 Serie A|1991–92]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] ([[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12]]) have been undefeated. In Turkish soccer, [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the [[1985–86 1.Lig|1985–86]] season completed the season unbeaten but finished as runners-up, although having the same points as [[Beşiktaş J.K.]], who won, but had an inferior goal difference to their rival. [[Beşiktaş J.K.]] in [[1991–92 1.Lig|1991–92]] completed the season unbeaten and became Turkish League's only ever champions without defeat. In Portugal, [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] ([[1972–73 Primeira Liga|1972–73]]) was the first club to do so and won 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drew two. They also went undefeated in [[1977–78 Primeira Liga|1977–78]] but finished second to [[F.C. Porto|Porto]], who lost once that season. Porto finished the [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|2010–11]] and [[2012–13 Primeira Liga|2012–13]] seasons unbeaten, with a respective win–draw record of 27–3 and 24–6. In Saudi Arabia, [[Al-Hilal FC]] finished a 26-game season in the [[2010–11 Saudi Professional League|2010–11]] with 19 wins and 7 draws, whilst in [[Iraq]], [[Al-Shorta FC]] went the entire [[1980–81 Iraqi League]] season undefeated. Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] finished the [[1963–64 Alpha Ethniki|1963–64 season]], Hungarian club [[Debreceni VSC]] finished the [[2011–12 Nemzeti Bajnokság I|2011–12 season]], Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK]] finished the [[2010 Norwegian Premier League|2010 season]] undefeated. The only unbeaten champion in [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazil]] was [[Sport Club Internacional|SC Internacional]], who won the [[1979 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1979 season]] with 16 victories and 7 ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colunas.globoesporte.com/memoriaec/2008/12/23/inter-79-unico-campeao-brasileiro-invicto/|title=Internacional 1979: único campeão brasileiro invicto|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] finished the [[1993–94 Maccabi Haifa F.C. season|1993–1994]] season (a 39-game season) in the Israeli Premier League with 28 wins and 11 draws.

[[Egyptian Premier League]] giants [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] are the only African club to have ever completed an entire domestic season unbeaten, let alone twice, having won their 30th league title in the [[2004–05 Egyptian Premier League|2004–05 season]] with a record of 24 wins and 2 draws and their 31st league title the [[2005–06 Egyptian Premier League|following season]] with a slightly worse record of 23 wins and 3 draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahly surrender unbeaten record in Egypt |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/109/374/index.html |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, [[2014 Úrvalsdeild|2014]] eventual Icelandic champions [[Stjarnan men's football|Stjarnan]] who were unbeaten faced an [[FH Hafnarfjördur|FH]] side in an away game which was the last game of the season, coincidentally before the match, FH were also unbeaten. In a closely fought match Stjarnan emerged victorious courtesy of a 94th-minute penalty from [[Ólafur Karl Finsen]] to knock FH out of first place and secure Stjarnan's first Icelandic championship.

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] went domestically unbeaten across the [[2016–17 Celtic F.C. season|2016–17 season]] over all 38 league games in [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], finishing 30 points clear of second-place [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the [[2016–17 Scottish League Cup]] and the [[2016–17 Scottish Cup]], giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forsyth|first=Roddy|title=Brendan Rodgers salutes Celtic's 'Invincibles' after they dig deep against Hearts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/21/brendan-rodgers-salutes-celtics-invincibles-dig-deep-against/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattullo|first=Alan|title=Gordon Strachan: Celtic "invincibles" will boost Scotland|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/gordon-strachan-celtic-invincibles-will-boost-scotland-1-4453829|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIFA World Cup===

The likelihood of a national team in the [[FIFA World Cup]] to win all of its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format only lasts seven games — although this feat has only happened twice, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on both instances in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. This is not counting the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying round]] of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/preliminaries/preliminary=28/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] came very close achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 [[FIFA World Cup 2010|World Cup]] matches in regulation time only to lose in [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the final, ending with a 14–0–1 record.

===FIFA Women's World Cup===
Through [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]], the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]]. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).

The 2011 event, won by [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title — the USA in 1991 and 1999, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]], and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]] — won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the USA in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra time—specifically the final against [[China women's national football team|China]], which ultimately went to a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The USA's third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage.

Three Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:
* USA, 1991 ([[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship|5 wins]])
* Germany, 2003 ([[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|6 wins]])
* Germany, 2007 ([[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|8 wins]])

Of the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:
* Norway went through their 1995 qualification campaign with 8 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss.
* The USA automatically qualified for the 1999 edition as host.

==Handball==
===Germany===
In 2011/2012, German handball champion [[THW Kiel]] achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international [[EHF Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 Toyota Handball Bundesliga - final table] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609080844/http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 |date=June 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In the [[Liga ASOBAL]] the [[FC Barcelona Handbol]] had 4 consecutive perfect seasons from the [[Liga ASOBAL 2013–14|2013-14]] season to the [[Liga ASOBAL 2016–17|2016-17]] season.

===Croatia===
In the [[Premijer liga]] the [[RK Zagreb]] is unbeaten for 11 years, they won 190 consecutive games, last time they lost against [[Osijek Motormodul]] (38:39) on 14.4.2007. In that 190 games they just have one tie with [[RK Poreč]] (31:31), after that game they won 178 games in a row and that row is still active.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812031321/http://sport.hrt.hr:80/htvsport/rukomet/06_07/m_IIdio.html]

==Volleyball==
In the 2012–13 Season, [[Vakıfbank Spor Kulübü|Vakıfbank İstanbul]] won all 52 games and reached five championship trophies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvf.org.tr/img/uploads/arsiv/2012-2013/2012-2013_Genel_Fikstur_web.xls |website=[[Turkish Volleyball Federation]] |title=Genel Fikstür |year=2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192342/http://www.tvf.org.tr/img/uploads/arsiv/2012-2013/2012-2013_Genel_Fikstur_web.xls |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in

*[[2013 FIVB Women's Club World Championship]].

Vakıfbank İstanbul won 6 games in [[Turkish Women's Volleyball Cup]], 12 games in [[CEV Women's Champions League]], 29 games (22 league, 7 play-off games) in [[Turkish Women's Volleyball League]], 1 game in Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and 4 games in [[FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship]], and never lost in the 2012–13 Season. In addition, they won all 51 games they played in year 2013.

Having started Turkish Women's Volleyball League's 2013–14 Season with 13 wins and [[2013–14 CEV Women's Champions League]] with 8 wins, they extended their winning streak to 73 games as of January 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/vakifbank-73-yapti-ceyrek-finale-kaldi_3_Detail_29_352567.htm |website=[[Fanatik]] |title=Vakıfbank 73 yaptı çeyrek finale kaldı |date=2014-01-23 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2014-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netball==

===Commonwealth Bank Trophy===
The Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.

The Sydney Swifts were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16–0.

===ANZ Championship===
The ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission Queensland Firebirds, based in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15–0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season games, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13–2 for that year.

==Cricket==
===County cricket===
English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]] has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some "first-class" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team winning all its games was not implausible. Between [[1887 English cricket season|1887]] and [[1929 English cricket season|1929]], seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]] and twenty in [[1972 English cricket season|1972]], though this was increased by two in [[1977 English cricket season|1977]] and [[1983 English cricket season|1983]]. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since [[1993 English cricket season|1993]].

Also, because of improvements to pitches via the [[heavy roller]] and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games "drawn" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.

Since tables of results have been kept in [[1864 English cricket season|1864]],&lt;ref name="rigby"&gt;Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 53 to 67. {{ISBN|072701868X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only team to have competed a true perfect season – winning outright every game – was [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in [[1867 English cricket season|1867]] when led by [[George Freeman (cricketer)|George Freeman's]] and [[Tom Emmett]]'s deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1867_f_Bowling_by_Average.html |title=First-Class bowling for Yorkshire in 1867 |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; they won all seven county games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/1867_f.html |title=Yorkshire 1867 season summary |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essex CCC achieved the feat in the Summer of 2017, with the bowling combination of Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter doing most of the damage. Ryan Ten Doeschate captained the side,

Since 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten,&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt; but none have managed to win every single game outright:

==Tennis==
In 2011 and 2012, the [[Washington Kastles]] of [[World Team Tennis]] completed back-to-back perfect seasons, the first major sports franchise in the United States to do so. The Kastles swept each of the 2011 and 2012 regular seasons with a perfect 14–0 record, then in each season went on to win their two postseason games and league's championship, amassing a 32-game winning streak in the process. This streak stands one short of the all-time professional sports record in the United States by [[1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers season|the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers]].

{{Expand list|date=December 2014}}

The term '''phoenix club''' is one used in professional team sports to refer to a new parent company that is set up to replace the parent company of a club that has failed in business terms but not in sporting terms, ideally while maintaining the continuity of the sporting activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33470801|title=Phoenix from the flames: How do you resurrect a football club?|author=|date=10 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/rangers/277115-what-happens-when-a-club-in-administration-sets-up-a-phoenix-company/ | title=Administration: How a 'phoenix' club can play in Scottish football | publisher=Stv.tv | date=1 November 2011 | accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the phoenix club is created by the supporters of the club which has ended (or appears to be on the point of ending).  A phoenix club will often have the same or similar name, logo and playing uniform to the original club. The term is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom in relation to [[association football]], though it is also used in other countries.

The term is also occasionally used to refer to a club formed by disgruntled supporters of a major team when a change of ownership or policy causes them to lose faith in the management of their favoured side (as happened in 2005 when [[F.C. United of Manchester]] were formed by fans of [[Manchester United]] as a protest at the sale of the latter to [[Malcolm Glazer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://supportersnotcustomers.com/2012/11/25/phoenix-football/ | title=Phoenix football&amp;nbsp;– the clubs that would not die | publisher=Supportersnotcustomers.com | date=25 November 2012 | accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although their status as such may be disputed if the original club is still in existence at the time.

The term is taken from the mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] bird, which is said to resurrect itself from its own ashes. In the Australia-New Zealand [[A-League]] the demise of the sole New Zealand team, [[New Zealand Knights FC|New Zealand Knights]], resulted in the newly created club actually calling itself the [[Wellington Phoenix FC|Phoenix]], albeit that the club moved to a different city, Wellington.

In some cases, phoenix clubs will retain the name of the club which they replaced, implying a continuation from the former team. In other cases, name changes occur, perhaps due to proprietorial ownership existing on the old club's name.  An American football example is the [[Cleveland Browns]], the original franchise of which moved to Baltimore in 1995 to become the [[Baltimore Ravens]]; the [[NFL]] however stipulated as part of the move the franchise would not be able to keep the team history and records of the Browns, a cornerstone NFL franchise.  In 1999, the "new" Browns were granted an expansion franchise and were awarded all of the former team's history by the league, even though the extant Ravens had the original Browns players and personnel.

It does not also include teams that relocated and/or have been renamed as a going concern, although many of the former may have their founding date as the day they have moved and still have strong links to their past, however they are considered to be the same club and therefore cannot be a phoenix (unless their previous entity officially folded and was liquidated).

However, the term ''phoenix club'' is one that could be disputed depending on the criteria used, as there is no single universally accepted definition. Furthermore, there may be changes in what each country's [[List of Football Associations by date of foundation|football governing body]] and legal system defines as a phoenix club and not a resurrected club.

[[Image:Pinboys nclc.04636.jpg|thumb|April 1910: 1:00 A.M. Pin boys working in Subway Bowling Alleys, 65 South St., [[Brooklyn, New York]], [[Lewis Hine]] photo]]
[[Image:Bowlingbahn.jpg|thumb|Automated pinsetter sets up bowling pins]]{{Use American English|date=July 2017}}[[Image:Pinsetter patent 2973204 diagram excerpt crop.png|thumb|Brunswick Model A pinsetter diagram from US patent 2973204.]]

In [[bowling]], a '''pinsetter''', or '''pinspotter''', was originally a person who manually reset [[bowling pin]]s to their correct position, cleared fallen pins, and returned [[bowling ball]]s to players.  Probably due to the nature of the work (low-paid, often part-time, manual labor that most frequently took place evenings), many pinsetters were teenage boys, and thus '''pinboy''' is another name used to describe the job. Gottfried (Fred) Schmidt invented the '''mechanical pinsetter''' and sold the patent in 1941 to [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. &lt;!-- according to [[Timeline of invention]] --&gt; While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams.

Many mechanical pinsetters are integrated with electronic scoring systems of varying sophistication. While many pinsetters have a manual reset button to use in case the pinsetter does not automatically activate at the correct time, other types have no automatic tracking of the state of the game – especially for the [[candlepin bowling|candlepin]] and [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]] bowling sports which use smaller balls – and are almost always manually activated.

==Common terms and design features==

&lt;!-- this needs illustrations/photos --&gt;
The design of the machines varies, depending both in individual company's hardware designs, and for the particular bowling sport's playing rules and equipment specifications. Several types of bowling make use of different designs for machines due to the different size and shape of the pins and balls.  Common part descriptions for just about all pinspotting units consist of:

* '''Rake/Sweep Bar''' – removes fallen and leftover pins from the pin deck area of the lane. The sweep may also stay lowered throughout the table operating cycle, to act as the primary physical protective barrier against improperly thrown balls
* '''Spotting Deck/Table''' – also used in pre-automated manual units (often, as their sole mechanical device); places a new "rack" of pins onto the lane for the next frame; and in tenpins and duckpins for automatic units, lifts the remaining pins for the sweep to remove fallen pins for the bowler's next roll of the ball in those games
* '''Deck/Table Shield''' ''(Brunswick A series only)'' – a fixed sheet metal enclosure, usually fastened to the spotting table's framework and diagonal forward frame edges, provides secondary protection for the spotting table system from improperly thrown balls (in addition to the sweep bar) and flying pins, and covers the pin chutes that are used to transfer the pins from the characteristic, cage-like Brunswick-design rotating pin storage turret above the table downwards into the deck for transfer onto the lane's pin deck area.
* '''Pit''' – a collection area behind the lane where balls and struck pins collect for sorting, actually a part of any regulation bowling lane.
* '''Pin Elevator''' –  brings pins upwards out of the lane's pit to the top of the unit for re-racking for successive frames, usually in the form of a vertically-oriented toroid-shape system at the extreme rear of the pinspotter for tenpin bowling units, to deliver pins upwards from the pit into the pin storage system. 
* A system of '''pin storage''' for storing the next full "rack" of pins after delivery to it by the pin [[elevator]] system – this can exist within (or as part of) the table, or above and/or behind the table
* '''Ball Return''' (or "Ball Lift") – Removes the bowler's ball from the lane's "pit" and sends it rolling back to the bowler on the ball return track, located between paired lane beds, back to the ball return unit at the "heads" of the lanes. The ball lift's components are designed to physically separate the ball from the fallen pins in the pit, and will not send pins into the ball return track.

===Manually-reloaded spotting table units===
In the decades leading up to the introduction of the fully automatic units, "semi-automatic" pinsetters, such as the "B-1" and "B-10" units made by [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick]], basically consisting of just a manually filled "table" similar to those used on the fully automatic units, operating much as the later units' component of the same name operated, were used by human pinsetters to both speed up the manual operation, and assure accuracy of "spotting" the full rack of ten pins for the next frame.[http://oldbowling.com/page3.html] The oldest operational bowling facility in the United States, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]'s ''[[Holler House]]'', opened in September 1908, is one of the very few all-manually operated alleys remaining in the 21st century that still uses the Brunswick "table-style" manual units.

==[[Ten-pin]] pinsetters==

===AMF pinspotters===
The AMF family of pinspotters, first marketed in 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldbowling.com/page2.html oldbowling.com]&lt;/ref&gt; are the first ones used in quantity in the industry.  They have changed little since the mass-produced 82-30 version.  There are three main pinspotter models, the aforementioned 82-30 (no longer produced, but still in common use, ever since the 1960s US bowling boom and the early career of [[Dick Weber]]), the 82-70 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irb-AzXzc1M prototyped in 1962], and still in production, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irb-AzXzc1M since 1963]) and the newest versions, the 82-90 and the 82-90XLI, both of which use the 82-70's general mechanical design. AMF pinspotters were originated by [[American Machine and Foundry]] and are now manufactured by [[QubicaAMF Worldwide]]. All operate generally the same way with small improvements.

The 82-30's operation and mechanics, having been significantly developed from AMF's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DogVYVOqMNg pioneering 82-10 experimental model], which depended much on the use of suction to hold the pins in a double-sided spotting table for both spotting remaining pins and setup of new racks of pins, are quite different from the Model A, A-2 and JetBack units from Brunswick (which the AMF 82-10 pre-dated by almost a decade), with differing sweep and table designs, and especially in how the pins are handled for storage, after they got to the top of the machinery. After the bowler rolls their ball, and knocking down the pins, the ball strikes the pit cushion block. This activates the machine, which lowers the sweep to the guard position. Then the table descends and the respot cells close around each neck of the standing pins. The cells that have pins in them complete electrical circuits that send scoring information to the display, and turned on one or more of ten "pindicator" lights – pioneered by AMF in May 1953 – in an electrically illuminated triangular framed screen on the pinspotter's masking unit in front of the machine, to identify remaining pins.

After the table lifts the remaining pins, the machine runs the sweep, clearing dead pins from the pin deck, then returns to the guard position. Ball and pins travel on a continuously running [[conveyor belt|carpet belt]] at the bottom of the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a "distributor arm" that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, [https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US2983510-1.png an "arrowhead"-planform guide rail atop the spotting table] governs the distributor's head piece movements) over the table [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GI5VvqXQBU as seen here], to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or "spotting cups" as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle. In the 82-30, its semi-cylindrical "spotting cup" bins are part of the visible spotting table (unique to the design of the 82-30) suspended below the table's frame, each at a roughly a 45° angle with each "cup" inclined, pin-base-forward, in front of each spotting cell, and clearly visible to the bowler whenever the table approaches its lowermost position. After the table returns to its upper position, the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new rack of pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w0p_C250Iw as seen here] to clear the new rack of pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new rack of pins spotted on the lane for the next frame. Should the spotting cups not yet be filled with a full rack of ten pins for the next frame, the sweep bar pauses in its forward "guard" position after its rearwards stroke to clear any fallen pins, until the cups all have pins in them, with the table only descending when the cups have all filled, and are ready to set them onto the pindeck.

Beginning in December 1961, the 82-30 units also became famous for having the "Sparemaker" version of the earlier triangular pindicator screen on their masking units as advertised by AMF and their staff's pro bowler Dick Weber, which added a set of eleven lighted "arrows" to the usual numbered ten lights for standing pins, triangular corner lights that indicated the first or second ball to be rolled, and separate lights to indicate a foul, or a strike.  The "arrows" were for the purpose of advising an inexperienced bowler to assist in [[spare (bowling)|spare]] conversion, by indicating where a second ball delivery should hit the remaining pins for a successful conversion, and were triggered by appropriate combinations of standing pins that helped the machine select which one of the eleven arrows to illuminate. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/iwilldare/691217804/sizes/l/ Rear view of an AMF Magic Triangle screen] [http://www.google.com/patents?id=_ttNAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=American+Machine+%26+Foundry+pinspotter&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false and the patent document for it]

There have been specific upgrades and improvements made to the machines produced after the 82-30, with after-market solid-state/microprocessor-operated controllers available for the 82-30 itself. The 82-70 is the general standard in most AMF-equipped modern bowling centers today. It features a [[microprocessor]]-operated chassis that is upgraded to short cycle the machine for strikes, gutter balls, or 7–10 pick-offs. It features solid state motors. The 82-90 and the 82-90XLI are further upgrades, basically using the 82-70's mechanics, which replaced the older, completely electro-mechanical controls with machine status indicator lights, much more sophisticated "pin storage" design, single control centers that handle two machines, and perhaps the most important upgrade is the self shutdown control, which shuts the machine down to prevent damage from continuing to operate with a fault. The 82-90 models feature a deck that is thinner than the 82-70.

[[QubicaAMF Worldwide]] has also introduced many different scoring systems that are compatible with all pinsetters and pinspotters.

===Brunswick A series pinsetters===
The [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick]] Model A, dating from 1956, as well as the developed '''A2''' (1962) and the '''JetBack''' (1965) versions of it, work as follows.

First, the balls and pins are pushed off the end of the lane by the rake onto a shaking board the width of the lane, in place of the AMF-variety carpet belt. This "shaker" transfers the ball and pins to the rear of the pit, behind the lane's pindeck. Two large rotating wheels, at the center rear of the unit, are situated with their common axis along the bowling lane. The ball-lift wheel is the one closer to the bowler and is smooth on its inside surfaces, with enough space between its inner and outer surfaces to allow the fallen pins to go rearwards through it into the rear-located pin-wheel (or pin elevator), placed behind the ball return wheel which has seven pockets, which capture the pins, and is somewhat similar to the AMF unit's design.

When a ball rolls back to the ball-lift wheel, friction lifts the ball up to the side where it catches on two lift rods covered with a rubber material. Wedged in between, the ball is rolled upward. When it gets to the top, it is deposited onto a metal track that usually leads underground, and is pushed along by a long accelerator belt. Finally, the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located at the head of the ball return track, where it is deposited.

When a pin rolls back, the smaller diameter of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first.  The wheel brings the pin to the top and drops it into a metal tray, called a "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a [[conveyor belt]] lifts the pin up towards the top of the pinsetter, to drop into a rotating metal basket called the "pin turret", letting it slide into one of ten cells as the turret rotates – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin.  When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute in the center of the turret being filled last.  Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them through its full downward travel onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck. As the table lowers towards the pindeck to set the new rack of pins, it is visibly protected with its attached sheet metal "deck shield", visible to the bowler at any time the spotting table needs to either descend part-way to handle standing pins after the first ball, or to fully descend (once loaded from the pin-turret above it) to set the new rack of pins for the next frame.  The Model A/JetBack series pinsetters characteristically halt their operation, should the pin turret not yet be full of pins for the next frame, by pausing the sweep bar at the back of its rearwards travel and holding the table in its fully elevated position, until the pin-turret fills and releases its load into the spotting table's upper level.

This style of machine is typically loaded with 20 pins, though most proprietors normally put in 21 pins to facilitate quicker loading and faster operation of the pinsetter, especially in cases where the bowler(s) make two strikes in quick succession — on all the Model A-based unit designs, the "second ball cycle" used for both a second ball's delivery or a strike won't complete if the turret is not full, with the deck waiting in its elevated position as stated previously.  Adding an extra pin does not put undue stress on the machine, but adding more than that is not advisable due to damage that can occur to the machine.  Other centers will only load the pinsetter with 19 pins.  Having only 19 pins in the machine will cause fewer stops from time to time but it will slow down the progress of the game if multiple strikes are thrown in succession.

The later A2 and JetBack versions, otherwise each virtually identical to the original Model A design, were augmented enough to have much faster ball return action than the original Model A units.  the A-2 was also designed to be a faster machine overall to increase the number of frames that could be bowled in a given time frame, thus increasing the revenue of the bowling center.

The visible deck shield, as well as the noticeable sounds of pins entering the pin elevator (sounding like bowling pins rattling in a metal drum) and of the next set of pins dropping from the turret into the deck chutes, are unique to the Brunswick A series. There is a large Brunswick "crowned-B" (their 1950s logo) on the front of the deck shield of the Model A, "A-2" on the A-2 deck shield front, and "JetBack" on the JetBack deck shield front, unless these markings have been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.

===Brunswick GS series pinsetters===
The GSX is [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick's]] current pinsetter. This machine uses a conveyor belt on the pit floor to move the pins to a vertical elevator system similar to the ones utilized on the AMF 82 series pinspotters, while the ball exits the pit at the side through a ball door. Pins are loaded using a combination of belts.  The ball return system on this machine uses an under-lane accelerator as opposed to a lift. It lowers the pin table on every cycle to determine scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Stuff Works on Pinsetters|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/pinsetter2.htm|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original model in the GS series (GS stands for Game Setter) was the GS-10, which was principally designed by Augusti Schmid in Scherzenbach, Switzerland to promote the sport of bowling throughout Europe. In 1984, Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards Corporation acquired the rights to manufacture and sell the GS-10 pinsetter. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary. The electronic control system is manufactured in Michigan, near the Brunswick plant located in Muskegon, Michigan. Subsequent models (year of introduction is in parentheses):&lt;ref name="gshistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=GS-Series Pinsetter Operation and Service Manual, January 2001, Part number 47-902735-000|url=http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|publisher=Brunswick|accessdate=2014-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214238/http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*GS-92 (1991) – Incorporated changes to the pinsetter to make it quicker to install and easier to service.
*GS-96 (1995) – Incorporated changes in the software and hardware to speed up loading time of the pinsetter.
*GS-98 (1997) – Incorporated a new consolidated electronic system that uses a two control box system to reduce the number of printed circuit boards needed to operate the pinsetter. Also, software and hardware improvements to make the pinsetter more efficient and user-friendly.
*GS-X (1999) – Incorporated a setting table and ball accelerator redesign that reduced the number of parts, the number of adjustments, and the amount of preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required.&lt;ref name="gshistory"/&gt;

The GS is characterized by a sweep that rotates downward (as opposed to dropping) as soon as the ball enters the pin deck. A GS-X shows “gsx” on the sweep when it is down, unless this marking has been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.

===Other types of ten-pin pinsetters===
The Mendes company produced a magnetic pinsetter known as the MM-2001.  It featured a flat magnetic pin table and magnets on the head of each pin.  It had a pit similar to the AMF and an elevator similar to the GSX.  Pin loading involves the combination of a carousel and magazine.  The company claimed this technology reduces stops in play due to table jams on out-of-range pins.  Mendes was bought out by Qubica, which sold the machine as the MAG3 until its partnership with AMF.

The now-defunct [[Bowl Mor]] firm of central Massachusetts (no relation to [[Bowlmor AMF]]) that was more famous for their candlepin pinsetters, also made tenpin pinspotters early in their history.  Some of these units are still in service, with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDNUsBFvyW4 at least one bowling center in Japan] having continued to use them, with some design features [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jii6U6fhAZc similar to the Brunswick Model A units] in appearance and function.

==Candlepin pinsetters==
The most common [[candlepin]] pinsetters were made by a Massachusetts company named Bowl-Mor (no relation to [[Bowlero Corporation|Bowlmor AMF]]), which was founded in the 1940s by two [[Lawyer|attorneys]], Howard Dowd and R. Lionel Barrows. According to the International Candlepin Bowling Association (ICBA), Dowd and Barrows were searching for business venture that could weather an [[economic depression]]. Marketing research on their part found that participant sports met this requirement, and that bowling was one of the top three participant sports at the time. The first Bowl-Mor pinsetters &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=DI9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Bowl-Mor&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Bowl-Mor&amp;f=false Patent for the Bowl-Mor candlepin machine]&lt;/ref&gt; were installed at the now-defunct [[Whalom Park]] amusement park in 1949. Though no longer manufactured, refurbished units, parts and maintenance support are available from several vendors.

Bowl-Mor pinsetters have a depressed pit approximately 14" long at the end of the bowling lane, placed about 4" below the level of the lane surface, with a curtain behind it, hanging past the lane surface but not touching the bottom of the pit. The curtain arrests the backwards motion of struck balls and pins, so that they fall onto the pit. When a reset takes place, a "board-like" sweep bar descends, driven by a chain drive system on each side of the machine along a pair of "L"-shaped tracks — one on either side, and sweeps the pins and balls off the lane, through the depressed area, and past the curtain and onto a [[rotating]] turntable. Here, pins and balls separate, being spun off the steadily rotating turntable by centrifugal force into the elevators.

An elevator composed of a rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards the top of the machine, and then turns 90 degrees to bring the pins horizontally across, bringing the pins past ten conveyors each wide enough to hold pins in a lengthwise orientation. Unlike the pinspotters used for tenpins and duckpins, since candlepins have identical "ends" to them, the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in one particular direction.  The pins fall off the end of the conveyors into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms the main part of the spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward end of its travel, and then begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the end of the lanebed, and release a set of pins, and then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins once more.

A separate elevator next to the turntable transports the balls to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen "dead wood" pins to ''remain'' on the lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for "spotting cells" in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by [[Roller chain|chains]] – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks on either side of the unit – or [[belt (mechanical)|belts]]. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate {{convert|1450|lb}}, and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000.

AMF manufactured candlepin pinsetters for a short time in the 1960s, using a Bowl-Mor style spotting table and an adapted tenpin-style sweep bar that operated [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHV1Me7RP8c at an unusually rapid pace] during its sweep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=kR1sAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=American+Machine+%26+Foundry+pinspotter&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2# Patent for the AMF candlepin machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless triggered into action by an automated scoring unit, candlepin pinsetters must be started by the bowler at the conclusion of a frame, by using a button or foot pedal operated switch to start the reset cycle.

==Five-pin pinsetters==
[[Five-pin bowling]] is a popular variation in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories:  string and free-fall.  String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached to the head of each pin, by means of a cord.  Essentially, the pinsetter is triggered by the movement of any pin by more than an inch or two.  With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move.  There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered.  The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator.  The elevator lifts the ball to the return track.

Free-fall 5-pin pinsetters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iCe3hfheQI work in a similar way] to their ten-pin counterparts, and requires initiation by the bowler pressing a "reset" button as a candlepin unit does to "cycle" it, when a ball is bowled or pin knocked down.  When the player pushes their "Reset" button, the machine lowers a guard, lifts standing pins and sweeps away the downed pins.  If it does not recognize any standing pins, it will set up a new set for the next frame.  Unlike tenpin, balls and pins are picked up in the same elevator or conveyor and are separated at the top of the machine.

==Duckpin pinsetters==
[[Duckpin bowling]] is played in two varieties.

Regular duckpin bowling is popular in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States.  One popular pinspotter in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was produced from 1953-1973. It has continuously moving conveyor belts at the ends of the gutters beside the pin deck as required by the sport's ruling body, the National Duckpin Bowling Congress&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndbc.org/ NDBC's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; that move fallen pins to the pit.  The Sherman's sweep device is located on the right side, vertical "kickback" panel of the lane and pivots 180 degrees (much like a fence gate) to clear pins.  The pin table always handles the pins by the neck.  A new rack of pins is created with a moving magazine that is shaped like a pin triangle.  When the magazine is loaded and the bowler is ready for a new set of pins, a lever pushes the magazine unit out to the pin table so it can take the pins out of the magazine and then set them down on the lane.

The Bowl-Mor company also made a duckpin pinspotter for a time, using a similar sweep device to its more famous candlepin machines.

Soft belly or rubberband duckpin is played in Quebec.  Most of these bowling centers use a string type pinsetter similar to five pin.  Apart from five-pin, rubber band duckpin is the only bowling variant that currently sanctions string type pinsetters.  The free-fall machine for this sport features a rotating turntable in the pit floor similar to a Bowl-Mor candlepin unit, conveyor belts in the gutters as required in the regular duckpin game in the US, an elevator similar to the Brunswick GSX, a turret similar to the A-2, and a rather flat looking pin table.  The sweep is similar to the candlepin Bowl-Mor.

==Off-spot pins==
Older table-based pinsetters that pick up the pins between throws could malfunction if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.

If a pin had drifted but still managed to be picked up, older table pinsetters would simply realign the pin into the correct spot when placing it back onto the lane. This results in less than accurate gameplay since the table is changing the pin positions during the pickup process.

Regular table-style fully automated tenpin pinspotters from AMF and Brunswick, from their beginnings earlier in the 20th century, have been required by the [[United States Bowling Congress]] to be able to accurately re-spot "off-spot" pins that have been knocked out of position, sometimes up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm from the normal setting position, and then place them back onto the lane in the same location. If the pins are sufficiently out of position to not be pickable, the table will detect contact with the misplaced pin, and shut down the pinspotter to prevent mechanism damage.

String pinsetters generally do not have a mechanism to place pins back on the lane exactly where they were before, during the spare clearing.  Since there is no table, collision damage is not possible with a string pinsetter, but they can suffer from string entanglement when the pins are being picked up, that prevents pins from aligning with the pickup holes.

Some studies have claimed that biological factors may be largely responsible for the disproportionate success in sprinting events enjoyed by athletes of West African descent. Chief among these is a preponderance of natural [[fast twitch muscle]] fibers, which aid in quicker reaction times. Scientists have concluded that elite-level sprinting is virtually impossible in the absence of the [[ACTN3]] protein, a "speed gene" most common among persons of West African descent that renders fast twitch muscle fibers fast.&lt;ref name="Wmarstttsu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Demirel|first=Evin|title=What Made Arkansas’ Record-Setting 2012 Track Team So Unique|url=http://thesportsseer.com/2012/08/08/what-made-arkansas-record-setting-2012-track-team-so-unique/|accessdate=19 July 2013|newspaper=The Sports Seer|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top sprinters of differing ancestry, such as Christophe Lemaitre, are believed to be exceptions in that they too likely have the genes favourable for sprinting.&lt;ref name="Wmarstttsu" /&gt;

=== Endurance running ===
Many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] groups also excel in [[long distance running|long]] and [[middle distance running]]. [[Jon Entine]] has argued that this sporting prowess stems from their exceptional running economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Entine|first=Jon|title=TABOO: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We Are Afraid to Talk About It|url=http://www.jonentine.com/reviews/quokka_02.htm|publisher=Quokka|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn is a function of slim body morphology and slender legs,&lt;ref name="saltin"&gt;Bengt Saltin: The Kenya project – Final report.

A study by Pitsiladis et al. (2006) questioning 404 elite distance runners from [[Kenya]] found that 76% of the international-class respondents hailed from the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] ethnic group and that 79% spoke a [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic language]].&lt;ref name="Dcoeker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yannis Pitsiladis|first=Vincent O.

[[Joseph L. Graves]] argues that Kenyan athletes from the [[African Great Lakes]] region who have done well in long distance running all have come from high-altitude areas, whereas those from low-altitude areas do not perform particularly well. He also argues that [[Korea]]ns and [[Ecuador]]ians from high-altitude areas compete well with Kenyans in long-distance races. This suggests that it is the fact of having trained in a high altitude, combined with possible local level physiological adaptations to high-altitude environments that is behind the success in long distance running, not race. Similarly, Graves argues that while it is superficially true that most of the world recordholders in the 100-metre dash are of West African heritage, they also all have partial genetic heritage from Europe and Native America, they have also all trained outside of West Africa, and West African nations have not trained any top-level runners. Graves says these factors make it impossible to say to which degree the success is best attributed to genetic or to environmental factors.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-06.htm |title=INTERVIEW WITH JOSEPH GRAVES, JR. |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |year=2003 |work=Race – The Power of Illusion |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|doi= |accessdate=April 7, 2011 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views in the United States ===
Various individuals, including scholars and [[sportswriter]]s, have commented on the apparent overrepresentations and underrepresentations of different races in different sports. [[African American]]s accounted for 75% of players in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) near the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.ncasports.org/Articles/2008_RGRC.pdf 2008_RGRC.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724084016/http://www.ncasports.org/Articles/2008_RGRC.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the latest [[National Consortium for Academics and Sports]] equality report card, 65% of [[National Football League]] players were African Americans. However, in 2008, about 8.5% of [[Major League Baseball]] players were African American (who make up about 13% of the US population, 6.5% male, no women play in MLB), and 29.1% were Hispanics of any race (compared with about 16% of the US population).&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 2015, only about 5% of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) players are black or of mixed black heritage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/27557/20150220/why-you-apos-ve-never-heard-of-the-first-black-american-hockey-player&lt;/ref&gt;

NCAA sports have mirrored the trends present in American professional sports. During the 2005–2006 season, black males comprised 46.9 percent of NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and 58.9 percent of NCAA Division I basketball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA statistics show a strong correlation between percentage of black athletes within a sport and the revenue generated by that sport. For example, University of North Carolina's 2007–2008 men's basketball team (the team was 59% black relative to the 3.7% black population of the institution as a whole) generated $17,215,199 in revenue, which comprised 30 percent of the school's athletic revenue for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given NCAA rules prohibiting the payment of players, some have come to see the structure of NCAA athletics as exploitative of college athletes. Some believe that since black athletes comprise a high percentage of athletes in high revenue college sports (FBS football and Division I Men's basketball), they are therefore the biggest losers in this arrangement.  Billy Hawkins argues that "the control over the Black male's body and profiting off its physical expenditure is in the hands of White males."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; His position refers to a very high percentage of Division I universities controlled by white administrations that prosper greatly from the free labor produced by the revenue sports that are heavily populated by black athletes. This claim is substantiated by statistics, such as the 2005–2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in which games started, and minutes played for black athletes were over double that of their white counterparts, with 68.7 percent of scoring in the tournament coming from black players.&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Black athletic superiority" ====
"Black athletic superiority" is the theory that [[black people]] possess certain [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] that are acquired through [[heredity|genetic]] and/or environmental factors that allow them to excel over other [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] in [[Athletic sports|athletic competition]]. Whites are more likely to hold these views; however, some blacks and other racial affiliations do as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins 1997, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buffington|first=Daniel|author2=Todd Fraley |title=Skill in Black And White: Negotiating Media Images of Race in a Sporting Context.|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2008|pages=292–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1991 poll in the United States indicated that half of the respondents agreed with the belief that "blacks have more natural physical ability".&lt;!--Who conducted the poll? for what purpose?  What other questions were there?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman 1997, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Various theories regarding racial differences of [[black people|black]] and [[white people]] and their possible effect on sports performance have been put forth since the later part of the nineteenth century by professionals in many different fields.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins 1997, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, attention to the subject faded over the first two decades of the twentieth century as black athletes were eliminated from white organized sport and segregated to compete among themselves on their own amateur and professional teams.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Wiggins 1997, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the subject was renewed after the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Jesse Owens]]'s record-breaking performances at the 1935 Big Ten Track Championships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;Regarding Jesse Owen’s impressive four-gold medal performance in the following 1936 Olympics, the then U.S head coach remarked that “The Negro excels. It was not long ago that his ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle. His muscles are pliable, and his easy going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=The Debate on Race and Sports Crosses the Pond|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3134375|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=39|pages=65|doi=10.2307/3134375|issn=1077-3711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, African-American [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Harry Edwards (sociologist)|Harry Edwards]] wrote: "The myth of the black male's racially determined, inherent physical and athletic superiority over the white male, rivals the myth of black sexual superiority in antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=Harry |authorlink1=Harry Edwards (sociologist) |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Dunning |editor1-link=Eric Dunning |editor2-first=Dominic |editor2-last= Malcom |editor2-link= |others= |title=Sport |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4m0FbGbxcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume=3 (Sport and Power Relations) |year=2003 |origyear=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-415-26292-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=5–18 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=The Sources of the Black Athlete's Superiority |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_4m0FbGbxcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Later in 2003, in ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,'' the JBHE Foundation published an article where they pushed back against this idea of a “black gene” leading to black superiority in athletics, a concept referred to here as “Racist Theory”. The JBHE contended that “If there is a “black gene” that leads to athletic prowess, why then do African Americans, 90 percent of whom have at least one ancestor, outperform blacks from African nations in every sport except long distance running?”  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=The Debate on Race and Sports Crosses the Pond|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3134375|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=39|pages=65|doi=10.2307/3134375|issn=1077-3711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Milton Hoberman]], a historian and [[Germanic studies]] professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], has acknowledged that disparities in certain athletic performances exist.  He has asserted that there is no evidence to confirm the existence of "black athletic superiority".&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman 1997, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

In American sports, there are and has been a higher representation of Asian American athletes who are of mixed racial heritage in comparison to those of full racial heritage such as the case with former football player [[Roman Gabriel]] who was the first Asian-American to start as an NFL quarterback. Another fact to note is that majority of Asian American athletes who are currently drafted/recruited to compete professionally tend to be in sports that require little to no contact.&lt;ref name=LackofAsians /&gt;

=== Chinese views ===
The idea among Chinese people that "genetic differences" cause "Asian athletes" to be "slower at sprinting" than "their American, African or European rivals" is "widely accepted".&lt;!--This is in the fifth paragraph that starts with "In many countries, particularly".--&gt; The ''[[People's Daily]]'', a Chinese newspaper, wrote that Chinese are "suited" to sports that draw upon "agility and technique", such as [[table tennis]], [[badminton]] and [[gymnastics]]. The newspaper said that Chinese people have "congenital shortcomings" and "genetic differences" that meant that they are disadvantaged at "purely athletic events" when competing against "black and white athletes".&lt;!--This is in the seventh paragraph that starts with "While Chinese are".--&gt; The success of [[Hurdling|hurdler]] [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] was explained by the hurdles event requiring technique which fit with the [[stereotype]] that Chinese are disciplined and intelligent.&lt;!--This is in the ninth paragraph that starts with "Mr. Liu's victory has not fully".--&gt;&lt;ref name="Yardley" /&gt;

Li Aidong, a researcher with the China Institute of Sports Science, said that sports coaches believed that Chinese athletes could have success in [[long jumping]], [[high jumping]] and [[race walking]].&lt;!--This is in the eighth paragraph from the bottom that starts with "Mr. Liu's victory has".--&gt; However, Li doubted that Chinese could compete in "pure [[sprint (running)|sprinting]]",&lt;!--This is in the sixth paragraph from the bottom that starts with "But Ms. Li said she doubted".--&gt; although there did not exist any "credible scientific studies" which supported the idea that "Asians" were disadvantaged in "sprinting".&lt;!--This is in the seventh paragraph from the bottom that starts with "There are no credible".--&gt;&lt;ref name="Yardley"&gt;Yardley, J.

== Explanations for participation and performance disparities ==

=== Physiological factors ===
A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that seven suggested that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance, one expressed caution with the idea, and the other 24 did not mention the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6401/is_n1_v17/ai_n28638110/ "The presentation of human biological diversity in sport and exercise science textbooks: the example of "race.""], Christopher J.

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
In ''Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing'', [[UCLA]] researcher Jane Margolis outlines the history of segregation in swimming in the United States to show how blacks have been affected up to the present day by inadequate access to swimming facilities and [[Swimming lessons|lessons]].&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margolis |first1=Jane |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race, and Computing |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2008 |origyear= |publisher=MIT Press Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-262-13504-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=17–26 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=An Unlikely Metaphor: The Color Line in Swimming and Computer Science |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolis asserts that physiological differences between ethnic groups are relatively minor and says: "In most cases of segregation, stereotypes and belief systems about different ethnic gender groups' genetic make-up and physical abilities (and inabilities) emerge to rationalize unequal access and resulting disparities."&lt;ref name="Margolis" /&gt; According to Margolis, views regarding "buoyancy problems" of [[African Americans]] are merely part of [[folklore]] which have been passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Margolis" /&gt;  Joan Ferrante, a professor of sociology at [[Northern Kentucky University]], suggests that geographic location, financial resources, and the influence of parents, peers, and role models are involved in channeling individuals of certain races towards particular sports and away from others.&lt;ref name="Ferrante"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferrante |first1=Joan |authorlink1=Joan Ferrante |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Seeing Sociology:An Introduction |trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vEbS8oBYSQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2011 |origyear= |publisher=Cengage Learning |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-495-60485-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=284–285 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Race and ethnicity: Flaws in Racist Arguments |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vEbS8oBYSQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=sport&amp;pg=PA284#v=onepage&amp;q=sport&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haplogroup inheritance ===
Elite athletic capacity has also been correlated with differing patterns of haplogroup inheritance. Moran et al. (2004) observed that among Y-DNA (paternal) clades borne by elite endurance athletes in Ethiopia, the [[Haplogroup E-P2|E*]], [[Haplogroup E-P2|E3*]], [[Haplogroup K (Y-DNA)|K*(xP)]],&lt;ref name="Moran-a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moran, Colin N., et al.|title=Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian endurance runners|journal=Human Genetics|date=2004|volume=115|issue=6|page=495|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Colin_Moran/publication/8214295_Y_chromosome_haplogroups_of_elite_Ethiopian_endurance_runners/links/54b8e8800cf28faced625c07.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2017|doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1202-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J*(xJ2)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moran, Colin N., et al.|title=Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian endurance runners|journal=Human Genetics|date=2004|volume=115|issue=6|page=494 (Fig. 1)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Colin_Moran/publication/8214295_Y_chromosome_haplogroups_of_elite_Ethiopian_endurance_runners/links/54b8e8800cf28faced625c07.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2017|doi=10.1007/s00439-004-1202-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; are positively correlated with elite athletic endurance performance, whereas the haplogroup [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E3b1]] is significantly less frequent among the elite endurance athletes.&lt;ref name="Moran-a"/&gt;

Citing haplogroup data from various previous studies, Ahmetov and Fedotovskaya (2012) report that the [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDNA]] (maternal) haplogroups [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]], [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]], [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M*]], [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|G1]], [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N9]], and [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] have been positively correlated with elite athletic endurance performance, whereas the mtDNA haplogroups [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3*]], [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B]], [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]], [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J2]], and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] are negatively correlated with athletic endurance performance. Japanese sprinters were also found to have a higher distribution of the mtDNA [[Haplogroup F (mtDNA)|F]].&lt;ref name="Ahmetov"&gt;Ahmetov, Ildus I. and Olga N. Fedotovskaya (2012).

== Racial prejudices, discrimination, segregation, and integration ==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=September 2016}}
The [[baseball color line]], which included separate [[Negro league baseball]], was one example of [[racial segregation in the United States]].

In the United States, a study found that a form of racial discrimination exists in NBA basketball, as white players received higher salaries than do blacks related to actual performance. &lt;!--When?  How many?  Criteria?--&gt; Funk says this may be due to viewer discrimination. Viewership increases when there is greater participation by white players, which means higher advertising incomes. This explains much of the salary gap.&lt;ref name=Funk2001&gt;{{cite journal

Researchers have looked at other evidence for sports consumer discrimination. One method is comparing the price of sports memorabilia, such as baseball cards. Another is looking at fan voting for all-star teams. Still another is looking at willingness to attend sporting events. The evidence is mixed, with some studies finding bias against blacks and others not. A bias, if it exists, may be diminishing and possibly disappearing, according to a study on fan voting for baseball all-star teams.&lt;ref name=Funk2001 /&gt;

=== Major League Baseball ===
{{Main article|Baseball color line}}

Debuting with the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947, [[Jackie Robinson]] was the first [[African American|black]] [[Major League Baseball]] player of the modern era.

The under-representation of blacks in U.S. baseball ended during the early years of the [[civil rights movement]]. The representation of different races in Major League Baseball has been increasing since 1947 according to Mark Armour and Daniel R Levitt of the Society for American Baseball Research. According to their research, African American representation reached its peak in 1984 when it reached 18.4%. However, the African American representation has been steadily decreasing since that point. As of 2016, the African American representation was down to 6.7%.

According to Armour and Levitt, the Latino representation has been steadily increasing since 1947. That year, the representation was only at 0.7%. Since that time, the Latino representation in baseball has increased substantially. As of 2016, the Latino representation was at 27.4%.

Asian American representation in baseball has been much less abundant throughout the game’s history according to Armour and Levitt. Their representation in the Major League did not get over 1% until 1999 when their representation was at 1.2%. While the representation is increasing, it is doing so significantly slower than the other races. As of 2016 Asian American representation was only at 2.1%, a small increase from 1999.

According to Armour and Levitt, Whites make up the largest portion of the different races represented in the Major League. However, their representation has been steadily declining as the African American, Asian, and Latino representation has been steadily on the rise. The Society for American Baseball research shows that white representation was at 98.3% in 1947. Since then, representation has decreased to 63.7% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dettman|first=David|date=2017-03-20|title=SABR’s Guide to Doing Baseball ResearchRR 2017/084 SABR’s Guide to Doing Baseball Research Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Phoenix, AZ 2012- URL: http://sabr.org/how-to Last visited October 2016 Gratis, with some content restricted to SABR members|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/rr-10-2016-0248|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=31|issue=3|pages=28–28|doi=10.1108/rr-10-2016-0248|issn=0950-4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a journal titled Using Giddens's Structuration Theory to Examine the Waning Participation of African Americans in Baseball, it says “Numerous studies have shown that African-American youths are more likely than Whites to be encouraged and even directed to play basketball over other sports."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogden|first=David|last2=Rose|first2=Randall A.|date=2005-03|title=Using Giddens’s Structuration Theory to Examine the Waning Participation of African Americans in Baseball|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0021934704266091|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=35|issue=4|pages=225–245|doi=10.1177/0021934704266091|issn=0021-9347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Basketball Association ===
{{Main article|National Basketball Association}}
Although [[Japanese-American]] [[Wataru Misaka]] broke the [[National Basketball Association]]'s color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the [[New York Knicks]], 1950 is recognized as the year the NBA integrated. That year [[African-American]] players joined several teams; they included [[Chuck Cooper (basketball)|Chuck Cooper]] with the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton|Nat "Sweetwater" Clifton]] with the [[New York Knicks]], and [[Earl Lloyd]] with the [[Washington Bullets]].

=== National Football League ===
{{see also|Black players in American professional football|Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks}}
Black players participated in the [[National Football League]] from its inception in 1920; however, there were no African-American players from 1933 to 1946. There is a great deal of speculation as to why this “gentleman’s agreement”, as it became to be called, was implemented during this era. Some argue that it was purely because of the Great Depression. Jobs were difficult to come by, and thus race relations became increasingly strained as African-Americans, and other minorities, became perceived as “threats”. Finally, in 1946, the Los Angeles Rams broke this unofficial “agreement” and drafted Kenny Washington along with Woody Strode in the same year. The final NFL team to break this agreement was the Washington Redskins, who signed Bobby Mitchell in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781526438126|title=Media Industries and Sport Scandals: Deadspin, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and the Manti Te’o Hoax|last=Burroughs|first=Benjamin|last2=Vogan|first2=Travis|date=2015|publisher=Human Kinetics, Inc.|isbn=9781526438126|location=1 Oliver's Yard, 55 City Road, London EC1Y 1SP United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, George Taliaferro, the first African American who played in NFL died at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/10/08/indiana-nfl-star-george-taliaferro-dies/1574290002/ George Taliaferro, first African-American ever taken in NFL draft, dies at 91]&lt;/ref&gt; While George was the first African American drafted to play in the NFL, the first African American would not be drafted as the Quarterback until 1953, when Willie Thrower was drafted to play with the Chicago Bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1993-09-01|title=Professional football: the official Pro Football Hall of Fame bibliography|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5860/choice.31-0054|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=31|issue=01|pages=31–0054-31-0054|doi=10.5860/choice.31-0054|issn=0009-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wouldn’t be for another 14 years, 1967, until the first African American, Emlen Tunnell, would be elected for the NFL Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1993-09-01|title=Professional football: the official Pro Football Hall of Fame bibliography|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5860/choice.31-0054|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=31|issue=01|pages=31–0054-31-0054|doi=10.5860/choice.31-0054|issn=0009-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional Golfers Association ===
In 1961, the "Caucasians only" clause was struck from the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]] constitution. 

Throughout the game’s history, golf has not included many African-American players.They were often denied the opportunity to golf. However, many found a way to play the game anyway. According to an article by the African-American Registry titled African-Americans and Golf, a Brief History, “the Professional Golf Association of America (PGA) fought hard and until 1961, successfully maintained its all-white status. Black golfers (then) created their own organization of touring professionals.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/422755031|title=African American history : an introduction|last=1945-|first=Turner-Sadler, Joanne,|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107436|edition=Rev. ed|location=New York|oclc=422755031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger Woods has had a major impact on the game of golf, especially among minorities. The article, African-Americans and Golf, a Brief History, states “With the assent of Tiger Woods and his golf game comes an increased interest and participation from young minorities in the game. He himself envisions this impacting in the next ten years as they come of age and develop physically as well." Woods hopes minority participation will continue to increase in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/422755031|title=African American history : an introduction|last=1945-|first=Turner-Sadler, Joanne,|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433107436|edition=Rev. ed|location=New York|oclc=422755031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African American participation in golf has been increasing. In a journal titled African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs: The Effect on Golf after Tiger Woods, it says “Smith (1997) reported data from a National Golf Foundation (NDF) study in the United States indicating there are 676,000 African-American golfers (27% of the 24.7 million golfers)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=Venita|date=2003-07|title=African American Culture and Physical Skill Development Programs|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0021934703033006005|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=33|issue=6|pages=801–816|doi=10.1177/0021934703033006005|issn=0021-9347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As African-American participation increased, Asian participation in professional golf has also increased. According to an article by Golfweek titled Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory, there were 10 golfers which was a tournament record. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romine|first=Brentley|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=April 2018|title=Record Number of Asian Golfers Compete for Masters Glory|url=golfweek.com/2018/04/05/record-number-of-asian-golfers-compete-formasters -glory/.|journal=Golfweek|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article Where are all the black golfers? Nearly two decades after Tiger Woods’ arrival, golf still struggles to attract minorities, As of 2013 there were 25.7 million golfers which are composed of 20.3 million whites, 3.1 million Hispanics, 1.3 million African-Americans, and 1 million Asian-Americans. The lack of diversity is still very apparent in golf today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bamberger|first=Michael|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=July 2013|title=Where Are All the Black Golfers?

=== Positions of power: coaching and administration ===
Referring to quarterbacks, head coaches, and athletic directors, [[Kenneth L. Shropshire]] of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] has described the number of African Americans in "positions of power" as "woefully low".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 2000, 78% of players in the NBA were black, but only 33% of NBA officials were minorities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Duncan 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of minorities in positions of leadership has been attributed to racial stereotypes as well "[[old boy network]]s" and white administrators [[business networking|networking]] within their own race.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  In 2003, the NFL implemented the [[Rooney Rule]], requiring teams searching for a new [[head coach]] to interview at least one minority candidate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

Similar to the discrepancy between participation and leadership of blacks in American professional sports leagues, NCAA sports also have had a low percentage of administrators and coaches relative to the number of athletes. For example, during the 2005–2006 academic year, high revenue NCAA sports (basketball and football) had 51 percent black student athletes, whereas only 17 percent of head coaches in the same high revenue sports were black&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the same 2005–2006 year, only 5.5 percent of athletic directors at Division I "PWIs" (Primarily White Institutions), were black.&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010 141"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Bowden, a notable white Division I football coach, suggests that the reason many university presidents will not hire black coaches is "because they are worried about how alumni and donors will react."&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010 141" /&gt; Bowden also refers to the "untapped talent"&lt;ref name="Hawkins 2010" /&gt; existing within the ranks of assistant coaches in Division I football. The data backs up this claim, with 26.9 percent of Division I assistant coaches during the 2005-06 year in men's revenue sports being black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Billy|title=The New Plantation: Black Athletes, College Sports, and Predominantly White NCAA Institutions|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notably higher percentage than of head coaches. In terms of administrative positions, they have been concentrated largely in the hands of whites. As recently as 2009, 92.5 percent of university presidents in the FBS were white, 87.5 percent of athletic directors were white, and 100 percent of the conference commissioners were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Kevin|title=Tennessee's Hire Shows Racism is Alive and Well in College Football|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/326890-tennessee-vols-hiring-of-dooley-shows-racism-in-cf-alive-and-well}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these statistics, black head coaches have become more prevalent at the FBS level. As of 2012, there are now 15 black head coaches in FBS football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Ted|title=Opportunities for black coaches on the rise|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7623932/opportunities-black-coaches-rise-college-football}}&lt;/ref&gt; including now 3 in the SEC, a conference that did not hire its first black head coach until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Habib|first=Daniel G.|title=The Road Ahead: Sylvester Croom's arrival at Mississippi State just starts another journey|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1030815/index.htm|work=CNN|date=15 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Segregated seating ===
In 1960, the [[Houston Oilers]] implemented a policy at [[Jeppesen Stadium]] to [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregate]] the black fans from the white fans.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax 2008, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clem Daniels]], [[Art Powell (wide receiver)|Art Powell]], [[Bo Roberson]], and [[Fred Williamson]] of the [[Oakland Raiders]] refused to play in a stadium that had segregated seating.  The 1963 game against the [[New York Jets]] was relocated to a different stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax 2008, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mascot controversies ===
{{Main article|Native American mascot controversy}}
The use of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] names and imagery for [[mascot|sport mascots]] or in franchise memorabilia is an issue of ongoing discussion and controversy in American sports, as some Native American representatives have objected to such use without explicit negotiation and permission.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2009, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promoting racial harmony and breaking stereotypes ===
According to William Jeynes, a professor of education at [[California State University, Long Beach]], the gathering at the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|first Thanksgiving in the United States]] was an attempt to create racial harmony through games and sporting contests that included [[running]], [[shooting]] and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeynes |first1=William |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=American Educational History: School, Society, and the Common Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate=April 13, 2011 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2007 |origyear= |publisher=Sage Publications |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-4129-1421-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=9 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=The Colonial Experience, 1607–1776: Puritans' and Pilgrims' Relationship with Native Americans |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huping Ling]], a professor of history at [[Truman State University]], has asserted that the participation of Chinese students in sports helped break local stereotypes in the St. Louis area during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=LING |first1=Huping |authorlink1=Huping Ling |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Chinese St. Louis: From Enclave to Cultural Community |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d48Fos9tv58C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2004 |origyear= |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-59213-039-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=112 |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Dwindling "Hop Alley"; 1920s – 1966 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=d48Fos9tv58C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;This history of racial tension in the competition between whites and minority groups shows an attempt to prove the humanity, equality, and even occasionally their superiority on the playing field. By doing so, groups of minorities hoped that sports would serve as a source for racial pride that would eventually lead to upward social mobility. However, as early as 1984, criticism has been levied against these ideas. Sports sociologist Harry Edwards openly criticized African Americans as being “co-conspirators” in their own children’s exploitation by the white dominated sports establishment. Despite the the perception of a white dominated sports establishment, research has shown that there is greater emphasis on sports as a potential career path in the African American community compared to the White community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beamon|first=Krystal K.|date=2009-08-27|title=Are Sports Overemphasized in the Socialization Process of African American Males?

Racial remarks have been made about athletes of color throughout history. Radio host Don Imus described the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hos" on his radio program "Inmus in the Morning" in 2007. Later on he proclaimed that the match-up between Rutgers and their opponents looked like a showdown of the "jigaboos versus the wannabes." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=700de70c-5ec6-40f7-bd39-0874026cc1f4@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 sports commentator Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder proclaimed his theory on why Black Americans are more athletic than White Americans:

"The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way, because of his high thighs and big thighs that goes up into his back, and they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs and he's bred to be the better athlete because this goes back all the way to the Civil War when during the slave trade … the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big black kid …"

Snyder was later fired by CBS. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=642a95b8-81fc-494a-9afb-78131b9bc861@sessionmgr102|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherman Maxwell was the first African American sports broadcaster. He began his career in 1929 on WNJ radio. He was known as "the voice of Newark". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/NewsDetailsPage/NewsDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=News&amp;docIndex=&amp;source=&amp;prodId=&amp;mode=view&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=OVIC&amp;catId=&amp;u=csubak&amp;displayGroups=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA181561747&amp;activityType=&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=|title=Gale - Enter Product Login|website=ic.galegroup.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portrayals in film ==
The US-set films ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' and ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'' have been described as memorializing the "golden age of sports" as a time of white prevalence and dominance,&lt;ref&gt;King 2006, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'' showed [[Don Haskins|a white coach]] [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners basketball team|helping to dissolve]] the color barrier in college basketball.

''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' deals with the subject of the [[Rugby World Cup]] in post-apartheid South Africa.

{{Main article|List of Indigenous Australian sportspeople}}

Inequality in sport for the [[Aboriginal Australian]]s exists due to material barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Giulianotti 2005, p.69-70.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 report by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] suggested that fear of "racial vilification" was partly responsible for the under-representation of Aboriginal and other ethnic groups in Australian sports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com.au/breaking-news/racism-common-in-australian-sport/story-e6frf33c-1111114656872#.UNn95bYj7cs&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Africa ==
In [[South Africa]], black representation on the cricket and rugby [[national sports team]]s is ensured via the introduction of quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Giulianotti 2005, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Discussions of race and sports in the United States, where the two subjects have always been intertwined in [[American history]], have focused to a great extent on African Americans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gems 2009, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of sport and performance level, African Americans are reported to be over- or under-represented.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; African Americans compose the highest percentage of the minority groups active at the professional level, but are among those who show the lowest participation overall.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2013, while 2.8% of full-time degree-pursuing undergraduates were black men, the group comprised 57% of college football teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/4110443/college-football-race-problem/ |title=College Football big problem with race |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Diane Roberts |date=November 12, 2015 |publisher=Time magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 64% of men's basketball players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/11/black-college-football-and-basketball-players-are-the-most-powerful-people-of-color-on-campus/ |title=Black college football and basketball players are the most powerful people of color on campus |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Shaun R. Harper |date=November 11, 2015  |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; While blacks predominate in football and basketball, whites predominate in all other regulated sports.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

A 2001 study indicated that black high school students play harder than white students, because the former were more likely to perceive sports as a venue to success. The study denies that racial characteristics, per se, is a factor in success in sports.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/exer_sci/ESS200/Raceh/Raceh.htm |title=Race and sport |accessdate=November 13, 2016|publisher=Smith College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all races and sports, from 3.3% (basketball) to 11.3% (ice hockey) are successful in making the transition from high school varsity to an NCAA team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/probability-competing-beyond-high-school |title=Probability of Competing Beyond High School |accessdate=November 13, 2016  |publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; From .8% (men's ice hockey) to 9.4% (baseball) successfully transition from NCAA to professional teams. Therefore, the overall success rate of high school athletes progressing to professional athletes was from .03% (men and women's basketball) to .5% (baseball).&lt;!---presume that baseball includes AAA minor leagues--&gt; The annual number of NCAA athletes drafted into professional sports annually varied from seven (men's ice hockey) to 678 (baseball).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/estimated-probability-competing-professional-athletics |title=Estimated probability of competing in professional athletics  |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |publisher=NCAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike black athletes, blacks as a group have not perceived sports as an important venue to prosperity.
There are higher participation rates by blacks as well as higher numbers of people in non-athletic endeavor, such as policy, teaching, physicians, lawyers, engineers, and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2014/09/why_are_there_so_many_black_athletes/ |title=Why Are There So Many Black Athletes? |accessdate=November 13, 2016 |author=Henry Louis Gates Jr. |date=September 1, 2014 |publisher=theroot.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletics have been increasingly subsidized by tuition. Only one in eight of the 202 [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] colleges actually netted more money than they spent on athletics between the years 2005 and 2010. At the few money making schools, [[American football|football]] and sometimes basketball sales support the school's other athletic programs. The amount spent on an athlete in one of the six highest-profile football conferences, on average, is six times more than the amount spent to educate the non-athlete. Spending per student varied from $10,012 to $19,225; cost per athlete varied from $41,796 to $163,931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Mary Beth | last=Marklein | title=Athletics get more dollars than academics | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/usatoday/article/1837721| work= | newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=[[Melbourne, Florida]] | pages= 4A | date=January 16, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---soft copy is missing "box" (present in hard copy) which has exact figures but otherwise supports this material---&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">'''Side stitch''' (also called a '''side ache''', a '''side cramp''', a '''side crampie''', a '''side sticker''' or simply the '''stitch''') is an intense stabbing [[pain]] under the lower edge of the [[ribcage]] that occurs while [[exercise|exercising]]. It is also referred to as '''exercise-related transient abdominal pain''' ('''ETAP''').&lt;ref name=pub_med_ischemia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=DP|author2=Callister, R |title=Characteristics and etiology of exercise-related transient abdominal pain.|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|date=February 2000|volume=32|issue=2|pages=432–438|pmid=10694128|doi=10.1097/00005768-200002000-00026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people think that this [[abdominal pain]] may be caused by the internal organs (like the [[liver]] and [[stomach]]) pulling downwards on the [[Diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]],&lt;ref name=Collins09&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Andrew|title=On Running on Lessons from 40 Years of Running.|date=2009|publisher=Authorhouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9781438936246|page=148|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xovMmC_USRYC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that theory is inconsistent with its frequent occurrence during [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;"965 athletes in six different sports (running, swimming, cycling, aerobics, basketball, and horse riding). Over the course of a year of training and competition, 75% of swimmers had trouble with stitches, 69% of runners were afflicted, 62% of horse riders had ETAP, 52% of aerobics participants suffered, 47% of basketball players did so, and 32% of cyclists were affected " Characteristics and Etiology of Exercise-Related Transient Abdominal Pain,' Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, Volume 32 (2), pp. 432-438, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; which involves almost no downward force on these organs. If the pain is present only when exercising and is completely absent at rest, in an otherwise healthy person, it does not require investigation.

== Causes ==
There is no single precise known reason for a stitch to occur. There are, however, a number of popular theories as to what may cause, increase the chances of, or otherwise exacerbate a stitch. A leading theory is that the pain may be caused by an increase in blood flow to the [[liver]] or [[spleen]]. Increases in the heart rate during exercise will force extra red blood cells into the liver which can cause temporary [[hepatomegaly]] and [[portal hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy|last=Moore|first=Keith|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary hepatomegaly and portal hypertension can restrict blood flow through the portal vein of the liver thus slowing blood flow to the rest of the body; this is why most runner's cramps are felt on the right side near the liver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muir|first=Brad|date=2009-12-01|title=Exercise related transient abdominal pain: a case report and review of the literature|journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association|volume=53|issue=4|pages=251–260|issn=0008-3194|pmc=2796944|pmid=20037690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible mechanism for the pain is that high internal pressure in the liver or spleen restricts blood flow, causing hypoxia.

There are other theories regarding side stitches than simple stretching of the [[viscus|visceral]] [[ligaments]] due to repeated vertical translation and jolting. Such theories include diaphragmatic [[ischemia]],&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Having a stitch explained|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/treatment_room/newsid_2131000/2131547.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; imbalances of the [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic spine]],&lt;ref name="pub_med_posture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=DP|author2=Callister, R |title=Influence of posture and body type on the experience of exercise-related transient abdominal pain.|journal=Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine Australia|date=September 2010|volume=13|issue=5|pages=485–8|pmid=20022301|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2009.10.487}}&lt;/ref&gt; irritation of the parietal [[peritoneum]]&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt; and strain on visceral ligaments by a fluid-engorged gut.&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pub_med_ligaments"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=BT|author2=Hopkins, WG |title=Investigation of the side pain "stitch" induced by running after fluid ingestion.|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|date=August 1999|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1169–75|pmid=10449020|doi=10.1097/00005768-199908000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further theory points to shallow breathing as a possible cause for a stitch&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Stop Runners' Cramps|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/how-to-stop-runners-cramps|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one possible preventative measure involves adjusting at what point in a runner's stride they inhale, or reducing the frequency of inhales (with an increase in inspiratory capacity).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p 391 The Lore of Running, Tim Noakes, Publisher: Human Kinetics Publishers Date Published: 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-88011-438-7}}  {{ISBN|0-88011-438-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for the variety of theories include, in particular, the prevalence of ETAP during swimming.

Most of the time, side stitches occur on the right side of the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This may be because the largest organ in the abdominal cavity, the liver, is on that side. Certain athletes also report a pain in the tip of their [[shoulder blade]]. This is believed to be because this is a [[Referred pain|referred site]] of pain for the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve.&lt;ref name=pub_med_ischemia /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2013}} When the side stitch is on the right side, published advice is to try to exhale when the left foot lands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is also a belief that an imbalance of electrolytes (such as calcium, potassium, and sodium) in the blood could also contribute to the side stitch.&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt;

The '''social impact of thong underwear''' has been covered extensively in the media, ranging from a ban on wearing [[thong (clothing)|thong]]s to thongs for the underaged. The rise of thong usage has been asserted by Christian minister Oneil McQuick to be linked to a rise of [[sexualization]] in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Oneil|last=McQuick|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ewm93pO7YQcC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=thong+society+sex|title=The Sexuality Series|page=29|publisher=L.I.M Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1-4196-4225-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Christian writer Philo Thelos to be linked to a rise in a desire to go unclothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philo|last=Thelos|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KpYJYeKiss8C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=thong+society+sex|title=Divine Sex: Liberating Sex from Religious Tradition|page=52|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2003|isbn=1-55395-400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Thong (cropped).jpg|thumb|Woman wearing a T-back thong in [[Sunrise, Florida]], USA in 2006]] 

When discussing the trend of wearing thongs, Christian writer Sharon Daugherty comments in her book ''What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?'' that the fashion industry "may have changed the mindset of our society",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sharon|last=Daugherty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3kx5Z42GPYC||title=What Guys See That Girls Don't: Or Do They?|page=61|publisher=Destiny Image Publishers|year=2006|isbn=0-7684-2368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the observation that "the whole idea of wearing so that no panty line or bumps can show isn't substantiated" and that "the thong was created by fashion designers to arouse sexual thoughts".{{sfn|Daugherty|2006|page=63}}

[[Monica Lewinsky]] gave evidence during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] that she was flirting with [[Bill Clinton]] in [[Leon Panetta]]'s office, and that she lifted her jacket to show him the straps of her thong underwear above her pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Starr | first = Kenneth | author-link = Ken Starr | title = Report to the House on President Clinton: Narrative Pt.

Marketing analysts Marian L. Salzman, Ira Matathia and Ann O'Reilly observed in the book ''Buzz: Harness the Power of Influence and Create Demand'' that thong brands are riding on the wide media coverage of thongs to create [[Word of mouth|buzz]].&lt;ref&gt;Marian L. Salzman, Ira Matathia and Ann O'Reilly, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sf85DYe9140C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=thong+society+sex&amp;lr=&amp;ei=4vcESNDMF5jWyATNt_D9Dg&amp;sig=f7ebSu-0y8UlAac7H8tqhsOIUiw Buzz: Harness the Power of Influence and Create Demand], Page 116, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, {{ISBN|0-471-27345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographer [[Lauren Greenfield]] wrote in her book ''Girl Culture'', "Understanding the [[dialectic]] between the extreme and the mainstream – the anorexic and the dieter, the stripper and the teenager who bares her midriff or wears a thong – is essential to understanding contemporary feminine identity."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Greenfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TUT9vKPr4_YC&amp;pg=PT155&amp;dq=thong+britney+spears&amp;lr=&amp;ei=TxEFSNTxLYOOywSSjuCiDw&amp;sig=gCRLKGJiBIpHS_FdG9K02x9uk4k Girl Culture], Chronicle Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8118-3790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, political commentator Cedric Muhammad wrote in essay ''The Thong versus the Veil'', "We wondered at the end of the day, of the two groups of women most prominently featured on American TV these days, who gains more respect for their intellect and spirit – the Afghan woman who is so totally veiled that you can't even see her eyes or the Black woman in the R&amp;B and Hip-Hop video who dances while wearing a bikini and thong?"&lt;ref&gt;Laura Flanders (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gg5NNztsUooC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=thong+culutre+sex&amp;lr=&amp;ei=DhgFSLXXPJTAzATBy_yXDg&amp;sig=QZNRmkA0_poI66Hywqj9tkkPYyg#PPA181,M1 The W Effect: Bush's War on Women], Page 181, Feminist Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-55861-471-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School restrictions==
The dress code for [[St. Ambrose Academy]], a Roman Catholic middle school and high school in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], specifically addresses swimsuits with "thong-cut legs" as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambroseacademy.org/dresscode.pdf |title=Ambrose Academy website |publisher=Ambroseacademy.org |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727005219/http://www.ambroseacademy.org/dresscode.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Dixon High School (California)|Dixon High School]] in [[Dixon, California]], the dress code specifies that all undergarments – specifically listing thongs, along with [[bra]]s and [[briefs]] – must be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhs.dixonusd.org/PAGES/Information/rules_dress.htm |title=Dixon High School |publisher=Dhs.dixonusd.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011210154/http://dhs.dixonusd.org/PAGES/Information/rules_dress.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Victoria]] Law School briefly put the school logo on thongs, but quickly pulled them from sale after controversy sprung up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indissent.com/jan2003/lawnews.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810135944/http://www.indissent.com/jan2003/lawnews.htm |archivedate=2003-08-10 |title=Indissent, University of Victoria |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=10 August 2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 a [[Miami University]] male professor was banned from using the school's recreation center because he refused to stop wearing thong swimwear. The professor challenged the school in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/1999/03/02/loc_professor_sues_miami.html|title= Professor sues Miami U to keep thong swimsuit |date=2 March 1999|accessdate=6 January 2016|publisher=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 a [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] High School principal was in the center of a variety of controversies including bans on clothing to the extent that "thong panties were unofficially banned." One student alleged that she was given a dress-code violation note for wearing a thong.&lt;ref name="Monterey County Weekly" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/12.14.00/dresscode-0050.html |title=Metro Active |publisher=Metro Active |date=14 September 2000 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story made national headlines in the United States.&lt;ref name="Monterey County Weekly"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070628153120/http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/articles/7128/print Monterey County Weekly] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0009/13/tod.04.html |title=CNN transcript |publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com |date=13 September 2000 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a female high school vice principal in San Diego physically checked up to 100 female students' underwear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10news.com/news/1515763/detail.html |title=Channel 10 news |publisher=10news.com |date=17 June 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120184346/http://www.10news.com/news/1515763/detail.html |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as they entered the school for a dance, with or without student permission, causing an uproar among students and some parents and eliciting an investigation by the school into the vice principal's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcsandiego.com/News/1427309/detail.html NBC San Diego] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011160853/http://www.nbcsandiego.com/News/1427309/detail.html |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her defense, the vice principal said the checks were for student safety and not specifically because of the wearing of thongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20020605-9999_2m5thong.html |title=&gt; News &gt; North County - 2 on RB High staff faulted for checks of undergarments |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2002-06-05 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20020616-9999_2m16thong.html |title=&gt; News &gt; North County - Demotion possible for assistant principal |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2002-06-16 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/06/18/thong-demotion.htm |title=USA Today |work=USA Today |date=18 June 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/06/18/national/main512654.shtml |title=CBS News |publisher=CBS News |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcsandiego.com/News/1429777/detail.html NBC San Diego] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214172315/http://www.nbcsandiego.com/News/1429777/detail.html |date=14 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[head teacher]] of a British primary school voiced her concern after learning that female students as young as 10 were wearing thong underwear to school. This incident led to a media debate about the appropriateness of thong underwear marketed to young girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2943874.stm |title=Bbc (Uk) |publisher=BBC News  |date=28 May 2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The [[University of California]] [[4-H]] program specifically forbids "string, thong or crochet" swimsuits for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/filelibrary/2557/28364.doc |title=University of California, Davis |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208005132/http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/filelibrary/2557/28364.doc |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For men, the dress code specifies "swim trunks only (no shorts, cut-off pants, or Speedos)." A similar policy by [[Virginia]] [[FCCLA]] bans "skimpy bikini or thong type suits" for women and specifies "swim trunks" for men ("no speedos").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.me.vccs.edu/fccla/documents/DressCode_000.doc VCCS FCCLA website]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Vicky Botwright]], then 16th seeded in women's squash circuit and dubbed the "Lancashire Hot Bot", was prohibited by the [[Women's International Squash Players Association]] (WISPA) from wearing a thong and a sports bra in the British Open Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/other_sports/1408489.stm |title=All thong wrong @ BBC Sports Online |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021203211540/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/other_sports/1408489.stm |archivedate=3 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Alexander Putnam competed in the [[London Marathon]] in a green thong and painted as a tropical tree to protest against logging in Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/s-%93Mara-thong%94%20Man%20runs%20from%20Congo%20loggers "Mara-thong" Man runs from Congo loggers], Rainforest Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female bodybuilder]]s in America are prohibited from wearing thong or T-back swimsuits if contests are being filmed for television, otherwise they are allowed to do so by certain fitness organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Maria R. Lowe, ''Women of steel: female bodybuilders and the struggle for self-definition'', page 191, New York University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8147-5094-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bans==
In October 2002, Florida officials banned thongs from [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] and other public beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-01-05-spring-break-usat_x.htm|title=Alcohol-soaked spring break lures students abroad|newspaper=USA Today|author=Donna Leinwand|date=2003-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thongs for younger girls==
The 2000s saw a rise in the popularity of thongs among younger girls, who have been dubbed "thong feminists" by comedian [[Janeane Garofalo]]. The trend has been attributed to pop idols like [[Britney Spears]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2002 [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] released a line of thong underwear targeted for girls ages 10–16, though critics pointed out that children as young as seven could fit one of the thongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/05/22/news/companies/abercrombie/ |title=CNN Money |publisher=CNN  |date=28 May 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JS Online"&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=43941 JS Online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114063620/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=43941 |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D9163BF937A15756C0A9649C8B63 |title=New York Times |work=New York Times |date=24 May 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for A&amp;F, Hampton Carney, stated that he could list "at least 100 reasons why a young girl would want thong underwear."&lt;ref name="JS Online"/&gt; This controversy spawned a great deal of free publicity for Abercrombie, including a chain letter that received wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/aandf.html |title=Break the Chain website |publisher=Breakthechain.org |date=6 June 2002 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122041435/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/aandf.html |archivedate=22 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; British retailer [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] produced child-size thongs and padded [[Brassiere|bras]] for girls as young as nine, eliciting a similar response from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=20 Feb 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/20/ngirls220.xml |title=(UK) |publisher=The Telegraph |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=This Is Money |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=363110&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;in_a_source=&amp;ito=1490 |title=(UK) |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=9 July 2001 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etam UK|Etam]], another British retailer, produced [[Sheer (textile)|sheer]] [[Top (clothing)|top]]s and thong underwear for girls of similar age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2003140951,00.html The Sun (UK)]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, photobooks and DVDs of underaged girls in T-back thongs has become popular as "T-back Junior Idols", which has come under scorn as a new form of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070503f1.html Photos of preteen girls in thongs now big business], Japan Times&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indecent exposure==
* In August 2007 a man in Texas was arrested for [[indecent exposure]] for being naked in his own backyard. He reported that he was in fact wearing a thong and was not naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/local/local_story_220113341.html |title=San Marcos Daily Record "Backyard exposure leads to arrest" |publisher=Sanmarcosrecord.com |date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090215/http://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/local/local_story_220113341.html |archivedate=7 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other impacts==
* A [[YMCA]] management firm has addressed thongs in dress code policy, stating (in different areas) that "thong-type wear isn't an issue."

{{refimprove|date=June 2016}}
'''Sports law in the United States''' overlaps substantially with [[labor law]], [[contract law]], competition or [[antitrust law]], and [[tort law]]. Issues like defamation and [[Privacy|privacy rights]] are also integral aspects of sports law. This area of law was established as a separate and important entity only a few decades ago, coinciding with the rise of player-agents and increased media scrutiny of sports law topics.

==Amateur sports law==
Membership is voluntary. The [[NCAA]] operates along a series of bylaws that govern the areas of ethical conduct, amateur eligibility, financial aid, recruiting, [[Gender equality|gender equity]], championship events, and academic standards. The [[NCAA]] has enforcement power and can introduce a series of punishments up to the death penalty, the company term for the full shut-down of a sporting activity at an offending college. Coaches are offered contracts and if any contractual agreement is violated NCAA has the right to hold any person(s) under the contract liable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/louisianastate/docDetail.action?docID=10529927|title=myLSU - Single Sign On|author=|date=|website=site.ebrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Title IX]] is an increasingly important issue in [[College athletics|college sports]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/book/15701|title=Sports Justice: The Law and the Business of Sports|first1=Roger I.|last1=Abrams|first2=|last2=A01|date=22 May 2018|publisher=Northeastern University Press|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act, passed in 1972, makes it illegal for a federally funded institution to discriminate on the basis of sex or gender. In sports law, the piece of legislation often refers to the effort to achieve equality for women's sports in colleges. The [[Office of Civil Rights]] (OCR) is charged with enforcing this legislation. This agency implemented a three-prong test for schools to adhere to:

*Are the opportunities for female and male athletes proportionate to their enrollment?
*Does the school have a history of expanding athletic opportunities for women?
*Has the school demonstrated success in meeting the needs of its students?

In 1995 the Gender in Equity Disclosure Act was passed to require schools to make an annual, public report on male-female athletic participation rates, recruiting by gender, and financial support. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''Brown University v. Cohen'', is an important aspect of litigation for women sports.

A critical piece of federal legislation, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 guarantees certain due process rights including hearings and appeals for U.S. athletes under the governance of the USOC and its NGBs.

==Labor issues in sports==
In 1967, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] accepted that players have the right to form unions or players' associations. It is now common for [[Professional sports|professional athletes]] to organize into associations or unions in order to negotiate [[collective bargaining agreements]]' (CBAs) with their sport's owners. Under federal labor law, players and owners must negotiate mandatory issues, those relating to hours, wages, and working conditions, in good faith. All other issues are deemed "permissive," and do not have to be negotiated. Once a CBA is in place, players agree not to strike and owners promise not to lock out players. By way of example, the 2005 [[National Hockey League]] season was cancelled because of an owners' lockout after the parties' CBA had expired. In 1994, [[Major League Baseball]] lost half its season and the playoffs because ballplayers went on strike over the issue of a [[salary cap]]. Historically, the most controversial issues subject to CBA negotiation are [[Free agent|free agency]], [[Minimum wage|minimum salary]], squad size, draft, salary cap, grounds for termination, and suspension.

In nearly all professional sports, the issue of limits on the use of [[performance-enhancing drugs]] has become an integral aspect of CBA negotiations. Drug policies are not uniform for all professional sports. Typically, each CBA explains the policy regarding drug testing, list of [[Doping (sport)|banned drugs]], violations, penalties, privacy issues, and rights of appeal. Drug violations may lead to suspensions and loss of salary. The [[BALCO]] controversy involving high-profile professional athletes and coaches highlights the allegedly widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in different sports.

Player agents, made famous by the famous line from a player to his agent ("Show me the money!") in the movie ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', are generally certified by each sport's players' association. Once certified, player agents or contract advisors may negotiate individual player contracts. Agents who are entrusted to conduct business on a player's behalf owe a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]], i.e., a duty to remain loyal, act honestly, behave ethically, and act in the player's best interest when negotiating. More than half the states in the United States currently regulate the activities of player agents in addition to union regulation for bad acts. Super agents like baseball's [[Scott Boras]] and football's [[Drew Rosenhaus]] are frequently the subject of media profiles.

The first body to assist player agents in learning the ins and outs of contract negotiations, endorsements and media relations was the Association for Representatives of Athletes. The co-founders and leaders of ARPA, since absorbed into the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]], were Professor William Weston (University of Baltimore Law School) and Professor Michael E. Jones (University of Massachusetts Lowell). The late Bob Woolf is acknowledged{{By whom|date=February 2010}} as being one of the first player agents for assisting [[Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Earl Wilson (baseball)|Earl Wilson]] to negotiate his player contract.

==Antitrust issues in sports==
{{See also|Fraser v. Major League Soccer}}
Until a few decades ago,{{when|date=October 2017}} most United States professional sports leagues' contracts retained clauses contracts that essentially prevented players from leaving their original teams by their own choice. These "reserve clauses" were upheld because courts found that these sports leagues did not operate in interstate trade or commerce, meaning they did not fall under [[Competition law|antitrust laws]]. See ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]'' (1922).  This interpretation has largely been eroded today. However, [[Major League Baseball]] may still retain limited anti-trust exemptions (it is unclear whether the entire exemption has been overruled by Flood Act because the true extent of the exemption was vague). It is important to note that the formation of players unions for the purpose of negotiating contracts with management is exempt from anti-trust scrutiny under labor law. The [[by-product]] of good faith negotiations between management and players unions in the form of a CBA is also exempt from anti-trust scrutiny.

==Tort law issues==
Until recently, [[tort]]s were never part of the landscape of sports law. A tort can be defined as an actionable wrong &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sports Law [microform] : Tort Liability of the College and University Athletic Department Administrator|last = chester|first = nolte|publisher = ERIC clearinghouse|year = 1979|location = Washington D.C.|pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1975 an Illinois appeals court established that players can be found guilty of negligence if their actions are "deliberate, willful or with a [[Recklessness (law)|reckless disregard]] for the safety of another player so as cause injury to that player." See ''Nabozny v. Barnhill''.  Negligence torts are typically harder to prove in [[contact sport]]s, where violent actions and injuries are more common and thus more expected ("assumption of risk" or "self-defense"). Spectators can also sue for negligence if their injuries could not have been expected (not "foreseeable") given the nature of the sporting event they were attending. A baseball fan sitting in the bleachers could reasonably expect a baseball might come toward the seat, but a wrestling fan sitting courtside would not reasonably expect a wrestler to come flying his or her way.

Sports' tort law extends into other less obvious areas. Team doctors could be liable for medical malpractice, a form of negligence, for giving a player a false clean bill of health so the player may continue to perform. A player who purposefully causes [[bodily harm]] to another athlete, coach, or spectator may be guilty of committing an intentional tort along with a criminal act of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]].&lt;ref&gt;R v Tevaga [1990] 1 NZLR 296&lt;/ref&gt; The law of defamation protects a person's good character or reputation. The publication of false information about a well-known athlete ("public figure") may be actionable if it was published with a reckless disregard for the truth or [[actual malice]]. The growth of non-traditional media outlets, e.g. web pages, [[instant messaging]], cable, etc. has added a new dynamic to this area of the law.

Closely related to the subject of torts in some ways, is the area of publicity rights. While the tort of defamation protects a person's reputation, the [[Personality rights|right of publicity]] permits a person to commercially exploit his or her likeness, name, and image. This area of sports law includes trademarks, tradenames, domain names, and copyrights.

==Outside the U.S.==
International amateur sports are run by a variety of organizations. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) is made up of each country's Olympic Committee, which in turn recognizes a national governing body (NGB) for each Olympic related sport. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) is the national governing body for all U.S. athletes in the Olympic and [[Pan American Games|Pan-American Games]]. The IOC is the international governing body for the summer and [[winter Olympic Games]].

Labor issues are not unique to United States law. The [[European Union]] has dealt with countless sports-related legal issues. The most important development in this area was the [[Bosman ruling]], in which the [[European Court of Justice]] invalidated restrictions imposed by EU member countries and [[UEFA]] (the governing body for [[association football|football]] within Europe) on foreign EU nationals. Bosman was extended to countries with associate trading relationships with the EU by the [[Kolpak ruling]]. The [[6+5 rule]] was a proposed rule by [[FIFA]] that sought to limit the effects of Bosman and its offshoots on football clubs; it sparked considerable legal controversy in Europe and was abandoned in 2010.

The subject of [[drug test]]ing, especially in international sports like cycling and [[track and field]], is under the jurisdiction of each sport's NGB and international federation, the USOC, the IOC, and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]. The final arbitrator in resolving drug related disputes is the [[Court of Arbitration for Sports]].

'''Australia'''

The capacity for the law of assault to intervene in contact sports is limited by the athlete's willing participation. By engaging in a sport, participants are held to accepted the inherent risks of such an activity as applied in ''Rootes v Shelton''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1967/39.html|title=(1967) 116 CLR 383, 385.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

However, questions of legality arise where the conduct was deliberate as was the case in ''McCracken v Melbourne Storm &amp; Orcs,'' where Melbourne Storm players sought to intentionally injure McCracken during play.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken v Melbourne Storm &amp; Ors [2005] NSWSC 107; see also Canterbury Bankstown Rugby League Football Club Ltd v Rogers; Bugden v Rogers [1993] NSWCA 49&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, issues also arise where conduct can be characterised to fall "outside the scope of the Plaintiff's consent to degree of physical contact during the game",&lt;ref&gt;''Sibley v Milutinovic'' [1990] ACTC 6&lt;/ref&gt; thus invoking compensation.

A '''sports visor'''—also called a '''sun visor''' or '''visor cap'''—is a type of crownless hat consisting simply of a [[visor]] or brim with a strap encircling the head. The top of the head is not covered and the visor protects only the face, including eyes, nose, and cheeks, from the sun.

The visor portion of a sun visor may be either curved or flat and the strap is often equipped with an adjustable  [[velcro]] fastener in back. The strap can function as a [[sweatband]] although usually not. This type of headgear was designed for use in outdoor sports (especially [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[softball]]) where eye protection from direct sunlight is desirable, but is now often used by non-athletes at beach and other sunny outdoor events.

In [[Gaelic football]], "'''The System'''" ({{Lang-ga|An Córas}}&lt;ref&gt;https://antuairisceoir.com/2014/08/12/na-dubs-an-mbuailfear-i-mbliana-iad/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tuairisc.ie/mo-ghraidhin-an-te-ata-ag-suil-le-peil-thaitneamhach-oscailte-spleodrach/&lt;/ref&gt;) is a style of play pioneered by the [[Donegal GAA|Donegal senior football team]] during the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0918/1224324120267.html|title=Gallagher answering McGuinness' call|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=18 September 2012|quote=Now, they talk on the phone at least an hour a day and spent countless hours on that same field, coaching and exhorting the players into becoming genuine All-Ireland contenders and devising a style of play that has become nationally known as "the system".}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as having caused a revolution in the sport, with establishment counties unable to comprehend it or work out how to deal with it.&lt;ref name=fearless_shift_axis_of_power/&gt; The System was used during the managerial reign of [[Jim McGuinness]] with Donegal, who overcame traditionally stronger counties to win two [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]]s and one [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] in the space of two years.

Donegal's winning of the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship was described as "one of the great GAA managerial coups" in history.&lt;ref name=fearless_shift_axis_of_power/&gt; Prior to this Donegal had had little success in the Championship since [[1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1992]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe|last=O'Shea|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/donegal-one-step-from-sam-after-20year-wait-3210495.html|title=Donegal one step from Sam after 20-year wait|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=27 August 2012|quote=Cork never really got going.

[[Joe Brolly]] said as early as 2011 that "Gaelic football has never seen anything like it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rory |last=Houston |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2011/0828/284053-gaatracker/ |title=As it Happened: Dublin 0-08 Donegal 0-06 |work=RTÉ Sport |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |quote=1520 The ever-brilliant Joe Brolly: "It is the mother of all defensive systems.

They reimagined it. They took a game that had been listing for a few years and made it a thrilling experience. In so doing, they interrupted the decision-making cycle of every team they met.

When you consider the opposition – Cavan, Derry, Tyrone, Down, Kerry, Cork and Mayo – you can't but marvel at the achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Malachy|last=Clerkin|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/1227/1224328179636.html|title=Donegal take a listing vessel and refloat it on a wave of thrilling proportions|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=27 December 2012|accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Donegal beat Kildare in the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An early incarnation of "The System" saw Donegal overpower [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the 2011 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] in [[Jim McGuinness]]'s first season in charge.]]
The format of "The System" has provoked much debate among Gaelic football analysts. Former [[Derry GAA|Derry]] footballer and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] analyst [[Joe Brolly]], after watching Donegal overpower his county's team in the 2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship, wrote a column prophesying an All-Ireland win for Donegal due to the team being, he concluded, "virtually unbeatable". He was proven correct when Donegal retained the Ulster Senior Football Championship they had won the previous year before going on to win the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] for the first time in twenty years. Brolly proposed at the time that Donegal were capable of swallowing entire teams into a vacuum. Keith Duggan—writing in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' after the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final—contested this notion, instead proposing that teams encountering Donegal had fallen apart due to their own weaknesses and that Donegal had merely exploited this. However, Duggan acknowledged that Donegal had "expanded the possibilities" of Gaelic football.&lt;ref name=fearless_shift_axis_of_power&gt;{{cite news|first=Keith|last=Duggan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0929/1224324605134.html|title=Fearless Donegal ready to shift axis of power|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=29 September 2012|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under "The System", players whose careers were thought to be behind them have been revived. Players such as [[Ryan Bradley (Gaelic footballer)|Ryan Bradley]] and [[Anthony Thompson (Gaelic footballer)|Anthony Thompson]] emerged as if from nowhere. The top teams in Gaelic football—[[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]], [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] and [[Cork GAA|Cork]], who had dominated the sport over the previous decade—have been made to appear merely ordinary, and have been swatted aside with relative ease.

Traditional Gaelic football formations are rendered redundant under The System. A corner-back such as [[Frank McGlynn]]—who had never scored a point in his Championship career before scoring 1–4 in 2012—has been turned into ruthless attacking players, while corner-forwards—the traditional scorers—contribute to the team's overall defensive efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/allireland-final-donegal-v-mayo-croke-park-330-3237031.html|title=All-Ireland Final: Donegal v Mayo, Croke Park, 3.30|newspaper=Sunday Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable successes==
The System was successfully used by Donegal to win the [[2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship]], the [[2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship]] and the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. Donegal's comprehensive defeat of [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in their 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final meeting was described by the national media as "the most seismic result in [Kerry] since the 1987 Munster final replay defeat to Cork".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colm|last=Keys|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/house-that-jack-built-in-danger-of-collapse-3190890.html|title=House that Jack built in danger of collapse|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-final against Cork, nobody outside the county gave Donegal a chance, and Cork went into the game as heavy favourites to win the title itself—even though this was only the semi-final. Donegal deployed The System to devour the heavily fancied Cork team and progressed to their first title decider since 1992.&lt;ref name=league_of_their_own&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary|last=Hannigan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0827/1224323032489.html|title=Donegal may be in a league of their own, but no it's not rugby|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=27 August 2012|quote=Over on BBC Northern Ireland they were no less befuddled... "Predictions?” asked Austin O'Callaghan. Jarlath [Burns of Armagh]: "Cork." Mickey [Harte of Tyrone]: "Cork." Paddy [Bradley of Derry]: "Cork." [...] Final whistle. "Well?” asked Austin, but his guests didn't really know where – or how – to start.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyrone's three-time All-Ireland winning manager [[Mickey Harte]], attempting to analyse the game for the [[BBC]], expressed his shock: "To be honest, I could not see that coming. Donegal annihilated Cork, there is no other word for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/19371945|title=Donegal annihilate Cork in All-Ireland Football semi-final|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=26 August 2012|accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donegal then unleashed The System on [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]], rendering them motionless with two early goals and keeping them scoreless for the first sixteen minutes of the match. The first goal occurred in the third minute of the game when Donegal captain [[Michael Murphy (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Murphy]] lashed the ball into the net, having collected a high ball delivered by [[Karl Lacey]]. ''[[Championship Matters]]'' named it "Goal of the Championship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldaily.com/2012/09/27/ddtv-video-murphy-strike-against-mayo-named-goal-of-the-championship/|title=DDTV Video: Murphy strike against Mayo named Goal of the Championship|work=Donegal Daily|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleventh minute [[Patrick McBrearty]]'s attempt at scoring a point came crashing off the Mayo post. Mayo's [[Kevin Keane]] fumbled, dropping the ball into the path of [[Colm McFadden]] who promptly slotted it into the back of the net for a second Donegal goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Frank |last=Roche |url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/columnists/frank-roche/dazzling-donegals-day-3239806.html |title=Dazzling Donegal's day |work=Evening Herald |publisher=Independent News &amp; Media |date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=24 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209022307/http://www.herald.ie/opinion/columnists/frank-roche/dazzling-donegals-day-3239806.html |archivedate= 9 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McFadden, who scored a total of 1–03 for Donegal in the first half alone, was soon through on goal again only for Mayo goalkeeper [[David Clarke (Gaelic footballer)|David Clarke]] to block the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Breheny|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/murphy-rocket-sees-donegal-strike-gold-3239536.html|title=Murphy rocket sees Donegal strike gold|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=24 September 2012|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2012/0923/338702-live-all-ireland-football-finals/|title=Live updates from the All-Ireland finals at Croke Park|work=RTÉ Sport|publisher=RTÉ|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The System returned in full force in the 2014 Championship, with Donegal defeating [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] in the semi-final to produce one of the most shocking results in Championship history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2014/0830/640353-mayo-v-kerry/|title=Kerry beat Mayo in replay thriller to grab final spot|work=RTÉ Sport|publisher=RTÉ|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Harkin|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/written-off-by-everyone-but-donegal-tear-up-the-script-30551297.html|title=Written off by everyone - but Donegal tear up the script|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game The System was cited by the media as having been behind the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Keith|last=Duggan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/neil-mcgee-pushing-bodies-on-was-key-to-dublin-upset-1.1914606|title=Neil McGee: pushing bodies on was key to Dublin upset - ‘We went away to a training camp for four, five days and Jim more or less broke down their game plan and we exploited it’|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=2 September 2014|page=2|quote=One of the lazier stereotypes about the Donegal defensive game – generally labelled ‘the system’ – is that it somehow does the work on its own. But McGee had plenty of moments in the spotlight with Brogan on Sunday and took his turn roaming forward like the other Donegal back six.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of opponents==
Cork's [[Donncha O'Connor]] said of Donegal in 2012, "Every fella knows what the next fella's going to do. It's probably a bit dangerous if you're concentrating on what Donegal do, but it's just that they have a system. Whether they're up or down, they stick to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=184277|title=O'Connor: Donegal stuck to their guns|work=Hogan Stand|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His teammate [[Ciarán Sheehan]] said in 2014, "I played against Donegal in the All-Ireland semi final a few years back, their power and fitness was something else and unfortunately we couldn't match them. I think they're definitely back to those levels and with that power and physicality you can never underestimate them and they're well worth their place in the [All-Ireland] final [against Kerry]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Harrington|url=http://www.joe.ie/gaa/gaa-news/joe-talks-to-carltons-ciaran-sheehan-about-the-cork-footballers-and-the-all-ireland-final/|title=JOE talks to Carlton's Ciaran Sheehan about the Cork footballers and the All-Ireland Final|work=JOE|date=13 September 2014|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Pat Spillane]] famously branded Donegal's style of play "Shi'ite football".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/local-sport/beware-of-praise-from-outside-conaghan-1-3971612|title=Beware of praise from outside – Conaghan|newspaper=Donegal Democrat|publisher=Johnston Press|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised Jim McGuinness during the early development of The System—"There are people who go to the Hague for war crimes – I tell you this, some of the coaches nowadays should be up for crimes against Gaelic football".&lt;ref name=league_of_their_own/&gt; Less than a year before McGuinness led his team to All-Ireland success, [[Vincent Hogan]] branded him "a leader of sheep" in a famous newspaper article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McGuinness a leader of sheep |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/vincent-hogan/vincent-hogan-mcguinness-a-leader-of-sheep-2940524.html |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=21 November 2011 |first=Vincent |last=Hogan |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/sport/local-sport/sheep-jibe-was-not-welcomed-1-3274387 |first1=Alan |last1=Foley |first2=Tom |last2=Comack |title=‘Sheep’ jibe was not welcomed |work=[[Donegal Democrat]] |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==View of McGuinness==
After defeat to Mayo in 2013 McGuinness said: {{quote|Our system is exactly the same every single year. It was the same in 2010 when we were with the under-21s. And that is the reason why we won the All Ireland in 2012. We'll go back and we'll identify all the things that we're talking about here to day – injuries, hunger for the game, what would we have done better ourselves, what could we have got right in terms of the whole season and of the game today. And once we've done all that, we'll know a lot more about the situation. That would normally take two to three weeks. On the back of 2011 we knew we had to go more offensive. That's why we didn't get over the line in 2011 and we put a huge emphasis on the attacking side of the game in 2012 to get us over the line. And it was that analysis that brought us over the line last year. That whole process has to happen again now. To me, it only makes sense at the end of a cycle to look at where you went right and where you went wrong and see what you would have changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Seán|last=Moran|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/jimmy-promises-to-find-out-why-he-s-no-longer-winning-matches-1.1484577|title=Jimmy promises to find out why he's no longer winning matches|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=5 August 2013|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''varsity letter''' (or '''monogram''') is an award earned in the [[United States]] for excellence in school activities. A varsity letter signifies that its winner was a qualified [[varsity team]] member, awarded after a certain standard was met.

== Description ==

The award letter is usually made in the colors and initials representing the school that the recipient attends. The letter patch is primarily constructed of [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] and [[felt]] materials. Standard sizes range from {{convert|4|in|0}} to {{convert|8|in|0}}. While {{convert|4|in|0}} and {{convert|5|in|0}} usually denote Junior Varsity achievements, {{convert|6|in|0}} to {{convert|8|in|0}} would denote full (Senior) Varsity. The stitching style used for creating the chenille look is called a moss stitch, while the outlining sew down is called a chain stitch.

== History ==

With the advent of organized sports, there was a need for uniforms. There was an additional need for identifications which was satisfied by the use of emblems or letters.

In 1865, the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] baseball team added an Old English 'H'. The 'H' was embroidered on the gray flannel shirt. The football team started to use the 'H' in 1875. For 25 years following the introduction in 1865 of the letter, it was the practice for the team captain to allow certain players who played in the most important games (Yale or Princeton) to keep the 'H' jerseys as an award. If a player did not play in an important game, the player had to return the jersey at the end of the season. Awarding the 'H' jersey may have been the birth of the varsity letter as an award. The letterman sweater was first regularly used by the 1891 "Nine" (baseball) and was black with a small Crimson 'H' on the left breast.

It is not known when the letter sweater came to high schools. The earliest known example of a letter sweater in a high school is found in the 1911 yearbook of Phoenix Union High School, Arizona Territory.{{needs citation|date=December 2016}} A student in a group photo is pictured, not in football uniform, wearing a [[V-neck sweater]] with the letter 'P' on the left side.

The sweater seems to be the home of the award letter from the 1890s until the 1930s. Another award during the 1920s and 1930s was a stadium style blanket given as an award. In the 1930s, the letter award started to appear on leather sleeved, wool-bodied jackets. The jackets from the 1930s were different in design than today's modern jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017114347/http://members.cox.net/phxjer/sleeves/history.htm|url=http://members.cox.net/phxjer/sleeves/history.htm|title=History of the Letter Award Tradition|archivedate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations and application ==
As a decorative clothing item, the varsity letter has a huge number of variations and no set standard is made to any school on how it should look.

Chenille letters come in many different forms and shapes. Some institutions use Old English or script style, two or three letter monogram, 3D shading, chenille bordered or the traditional straight block style. Students generally receive only one actual letter, but can win the distinction multiple times. These additional designations are shown by adding embroidered sport insignias, modeled metal insert pins, or bars that are attached to the letter. Some schools may embroider non-athletic letters with their award title, such as "Academics" or "Arts".

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The chenille letter is traditionally placed on the left chest of the varsity jacket, which is also at times adorned with championship chenille patches showcasing the team or individual accomplishments. School mascot patches are also commonly used.

During the 1980s, and again in the 2010s, varsity jackets have been adopted into [[hip-hop fashion]], with companies such as [[Avirex]], [[Phat farm|Phat Farm]] and [[Rocawear]] making their own variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.askmen.com/fashion/galleries/baseball-jackets.html Varsity jackets as street fashion]&lt;/ref&gt;
