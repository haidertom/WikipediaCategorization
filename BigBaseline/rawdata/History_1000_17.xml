==Report==

===Background===
[[File:Darlington raceway.svg|thumb|left|Layout of Darlington Raceway, the track where the race is held.]]
'''Darlington Raceway''' is a [[race track]] built for [[NASCAR]] racing located near [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. It is nicknamed '''"The Lady in Black"''' and '''"The Track Too Tough to Tame"''' by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as "A NASCAR Tradition." It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that is effective at both ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1430">Throughout the period before the [[American Civil War]], petitions and memorials relating to the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery question]] appear in many records of the [[United States Congress]]. Between 1836 and 1844, the '''21st rule''' of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] (the so-called [[gag rule]]) provided that no petition relating to the abolition of slavery would be entertained in any way; therefore, all such petitions and memorials received while this rule was in effect were [[Table (parliamentary procedure)# Use in the United States|tabled]]. 

The rule, proposed by [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Henry L. Pinckney]], was passed without any debate. During this period, hundreds of petitions relating to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of slavery, slavery in the [[District of Columbia]], fugitive slave laws and fugitive slaves, the admission of slave states, slavery in the [[Historic regions of the United States|territories]], [[Africa]]n colonization and repeal of the 21st rule were tabled.

The '''Age of Sail''' (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the [[early modern period]] in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sailing ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |title=The Age of Sail |publisher=[[HMS Trincomalee|HMS ''Trincomalee'']] |accessdate=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316114603/http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |archive-date=2016-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], demonstrating that the advance of [[steam power]] had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete.

The [[Suez Canal]], in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships, and made steamboats faster on the [[European-Asian sea route]].

==Golden Age of Sail==
The period between 1850 and the early 20th century when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Sail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html "Sailing Ship Rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161737/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html |date=2010-12-28 }}. [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak&amp;mdash;immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.

==Decline==
Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s, even if steamships also were used for such transports and became more and more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. 

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

[[File:ages-in-chaos.jpg|right|thumb|''Ages in Chaos'' book cover]]

'''''Ages in Chaos''''' is a book by the controversial writer [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1952, which put forward a major revision of the history of the Ancient Near East, claiming that the histories of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Israel]] are five centuries out of step.  He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the ''Ages in Chaos'' series.

Velikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists.

==Summary==
Velikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in ''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'' in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of [[Alexander the Great]] is garbled, but ''Ages in Chaos'' was his first full-length work on the subject.

His starting point for the first volume of the series was that [[the Exodus]] took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]], but at the fall of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Ages in Chaos''&lt;/ref&gt;  In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of "ghost doubles" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events.

First he claimed that the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]] came from the beginning of Egypt's [[Second Intermediate Period]], and that this was an Egyptian account of the [[Plagues of Egypt]].  He then identified [[Dudimose|Tutimaios]] as the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the [[Hyksos]] with the biblical [[Amalek]]ites, the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] with the Biblical [[Queen of Sheba]], the [[land of Punt]] with [[Solomon]]'s kingdom, and Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] with the Biblical King [[Shishak]].  He claimed that the Egyptian [[Amarna letters]] from the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], from roughly the time of King [[Ahab]].

== Later works on ancient history ==
[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Musée061.JPG|right|thumb|Akhnaton]]
A second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed.  Instead it was followed in 1960 by ''Oedipus and Akhnaton'', where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] was the origin of the Greek legend of [[Oedipus]], and that [[Amenophis III]] was [[Laius]], and [[Tutankhamun]] was [[Eteocles]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series.  In ''Peoples of the Sea'' he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt.  [[Manetho]]'s [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and [[Nectanebo I]] is a ghost double of [[Rameses III]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Peoples of the Sea''&lt;/ref&gt;  Rameses III fought invasions by the [[Sea Peoples]], including the "Peleset", conventionally identified with the [[Philistines]].  According to Velikovsky, the "Peleset" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries.  The [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]] then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the [[oasis|oases]] simultaneously with the Persians.

[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|Ramses II]]
In ''Ramses II and His Time'' Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]].  Thus, [[Ramses I]] was an alter-ego of [[Necho I]], [[Seti I]] of [[Psamtik I]], [[Ramses II]] of [[Necho II]], and [[Merneptah]] of [[Apries]].  In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern [[Turkey]] were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-[[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]].  The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at [[Battle of Kadesh|Kadesh]] is identical to Necho's fight against [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]], [[Nabopolassar]] is [[Mursili II]], [[Neriglissar]] is [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]], [[Labashi-Marduk]] is [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]], and Nebuchadrezzar II is [[Hattusili III]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Ramses II and His Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: ''The Assyrian Conquest'' and ''The Dark Age of Greece''; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/ The Immanuel Velikovsky Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former work, Velikovsky separated the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasties]], specifically arguing that over a century separated [[Ay]] and [[Horemheb]], conventionally regarded as his successor.  Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE.  The "great king" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king.

The books have remained popular.  The British publisher [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]] reprinted ''Ages in Chaos'' ten times between 1953 and 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Velikovsky |1977 |p=iv (publisher's summary)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009.

==Controversy and criticism==
The revised chronology proposed by ''Ages in Chaos'' has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, William]] 1952. ''New York Herald Tribune Book Review'' April 20. Retelling the Near East's Ancient History. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Waldemar Kaempffert|Kaempffert, Waldemar]] 1952. ''New York Times Book Review'' April 20. Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, and the Egypt of Exodus. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiebing, Jr., William H. 1984. Cosmic Catastrophism, Chap. III, in ''Ancient Astronauts, Cosmic Collisions'' Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-260-2}}. pp. 57-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965 the leading cuneiformist [[Abraham Sachs]], in a forum at [[Brown University]], discredited Velikovsky's use of [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;see transcript in ''Aeon'' 1992, Vol.3 No.1, pp.103-5, and also http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vsachs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] 1992. ''Aeon'' '''3''' (1), section "Bonanza from Brown" in "Of Lessons, Legacies, and Litmus Tests: A Velikovsky Potpourri (Part One)", pp. 88-90. "Velikovsky confronted a panel of four professors [at Brown University on March 15, 1965]: [[Leon Cooper|Leon N. Cooper]] (physics), Bruno J Giletti (geology), Charles Smiley (astronomy) and Abraham J. Sachs (history of mathematics) [who was substituting for [[Otto Neugebauer]] ], moderated by [[Henry Kučera]] (linguistics). In the event, Velikovsky debated the first three handily. He was stunned by Sachs whose address was both a rhetorical and substantive ''tour de force''. Velikovsky's rebuttal began: 'Dr. Sachs threw so many accusations in that [[Philippic]] of his that I am at a difficulty to answer; but I invite Dr. Sachs to spend the hour and a half tomorrow at the meeting [at Diman House], and every one of you too, and point by point each of his statements will be proven wrong.' Unfortunately, Sachs did not show up the next day and Velikovsky did not even mention Sachs [according to the tape recording of the proceedings in the possession of [http://www.velikovsky.info/Warner_B._Sizemore Warner B. Sizemore] who loaned it to Ellenberger March 31, 1979]. Curiously, Velikovsky's file for the Brown trip contains typed rebuttals to all the panelists ''except'' Sachs, for whom only partial, penciled notes exist&amp;mdash;but later that year Velikovsky would reply to Kim J. Masters, a Princeton sophomore, within a week in ''The Daily Princetonian'' (Nov. 15, 1965) over a criticism of ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''. Velikovsky's rebuttal to Masters was scathing, running the gamut from haggling over details to ''ad hominems''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[fringe science]] expert [[Henry H. Bauer]] wrote ''Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy'', which ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' described as "the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1064461-2,00.html | title = Science on the Fringe | publisher = [[Time magazine]] | author = Michael D. Lemonick/Gainesville | date = 2005-05-24 | accessdate = 2008-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from ''Ages in Chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Bauer |1999 |pp=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of ''Ages in Chaos'', which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes which he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/hatshepsut.html Lorton, David ''Hatshepsut, the Queen of Sheba, and Immanuel Velikovsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's ''Ages in Chaos'' series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in [[Glasgow]] specifically to debate the revised chronology.&lt;ref&gt;"Ages in Chaos?'-Proceedings of the Residential Weekend Conference, Glasgow, 7th-9th April 1978" ''Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review'' Vol. VI, issue 1/2/3 84pp (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and [[David Rohl]], was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable,&lt;ref&gt;Bimson, "Finding the Limits of Chronological Revision" in "Proceedings of the SIS Conference: Ages Still in Chaos" ''Chronology &amp; Catastrophism Review'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{harvnb |James |1991 |p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]],&lt;ref name=rohl283&gt;{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods.&lt;ref name=rohl402&gt;{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the [[Bronze Age collapse|end of the Bronze Age]], credited Velikovsky with "point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as "disastrously extreme", producing "a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve" and noted that "Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy".&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

One important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the [[Assyria]]ns in the 7th century BCE.  Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE.  They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties.  Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians.

==Legacy== 
In spite of the unrelenting hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University at Buffalo|Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal ''The Velikovskian''. He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title ''Pillars of the Past''. Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled ''Ages in Alignment''.

Far from slavishly championing Velikovsky's chronology, these scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in -331.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Little if any of this has been endorsed by the mainstream historians.

'''Anthropogeny''' is the '''study of human origins'''. It is not simply a synonym for [[human evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which is only a part of the processes involved in human origins. Many other factors besides biological [[evolution]] were involved, ranging over climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural ones. Anthropogenesis, meaning the process or point of becoming human, is also called [[hominization]].

The term ''anthropogeny'' was used in the 1839 edition of [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper]]'s  ''Medical Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooper (physician)|Robert Hooper]], M.D. (1839) ''A New Medical Dictionary Containing the Explanation of the Terms in Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pharmacy, Practice of Physic, Surgery, Materia Medica, Midwifery, and the Various Branches of Natural Philosophy Connected with Medicine''. Philadelphia: M. Carey &amp; Son, Benjamin Warner, and Edward Parker. Griggs &amp; Company Printers.&lt;/ref&gt; and was defined as "the study of the generation of man". The term was popularized by [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834–1919), a German [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], in his groundbreaking books, ''Natural History of Creation''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1868) ''The History of Creation''. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschicht'') (1868) and ''The Evolution of Man''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1897) ''The Evolution of Man: A Popular Exposition of the Principal Points of Human Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', Volumes 1 and 2. English Translation. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Anthropogenie'') (1874). Haeckel was one of the first biologists to publish on [[evolution]]. Haeckel used the term Anthropogeny to refer to the study of comparative embryology and defined it as "the history of the evolution of man". The term changed over time, however, and came to refer to the study of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason |first1=Otis T.|authorlink=Otis T. Mason|year=1880|title=Sketch of North American Anthropology in 1879|url=|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|volume=14|issue=5|pages=348–356|doi=10.1086/272557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last use of the word ''anthropogeny'' in English literature was in 1933 by [[William K. Gregory]].&lt;ref name="gregory" /&gt; There was a gap in the usage of the term from 1933 to 2008. Anthropogeny was reintroduced in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varki|first1=Ajit|authorlink=Ajit Varki|authorlink2=Daniel Geschwind|authorlink3=Evan Eichler|last2=Geschwind|first2=Daniel|last3=Eichler|first3=Evan|year=2008|title = Explaining human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture|url=|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|volume=9|issue=10|pages=749–763|doi=10.1038/nrg2428|pmc=2756412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now back in academic use at the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Anthropogeny vs. anthropology==
{{disputed section|date=June 2018|reason=Seems to be using words incorrectly and making incorrect intepretations from the evidence.}} 
The root in ancient Greek ''[[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|anthropos]]'' means human and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' means discourse or study, and ''[[wiktionary:-genesis]]'' means the process of creation or origin.
''Anthropology'', therefore, is quite literally the study of humans, whereas ''anthropogeny'' is the breakdown of the word anthropos agai but with the link word -geny (γένη, γένος) which again literally means the study of the birth and gender of humans.

According to the ancient Greeks who came up with the terms, anthropology is the sum of many sciences relating to the human study. There is social, economic, civil and comparative anthropology.

Anthropogony derives from the word 'anthropo' again and -gony (γόνοι), meaning 'the causing of, the birth of', both in a literal and metaphorical sense, referring to what caused by human born or/and conceived/created.

Anthropogeny on the other, is whatever derives from humans. -geny ('γένης᾽), meaning 'the born' or who is born of, but also the gender.

According to Gregory (1933), anthropologists are interested in measuring and quantifying aspects of being human, whereas anthropogenists are interested in "piecing together the broken story of the 'big parade' that nature has staged across the ages".&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=William K.|year=1985|title=The New Anthropogeny: Twenty-Five Stages of Vertebrate Evolution From Silurian Chordate to Man|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=77|pages=29–40|doi=10.1126/science.77.1985.29|pmid=17792389}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of the words, Gregory's statement is wrong.

So anthropology is the study of humans and anthropogeny, is the study of what humans 'gave birth to', to its core definition, although there have been many confusions by those who do not really have an understanding of the word's origins.

Modern anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[archaeology]]. The field of anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]].

The field of anthropogeny is also influenced by the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, however, given that it is the study of the origin of humans, it is also influenced by fields ranging from [[anatomy]] and [[biomechanics]] to [[neurology]] and [[genetics]].

A comprehensive list of Domains of Scientific Discipline relevant to anthropogeny can be found in the [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca/ Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA)], associated with the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA), at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

A '''charcoal pile''' is a carefully arranged pile of [[wood]], covered by turf or other layer, inside which a fire is lit in order to produce [[charcoal]]. The pile is tended by a [[charcoal burner]]. It is similar to a [[charcoal kiln]], but the latter is usually a permanent structure made of materials such as stone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1636">'''Chronological synchronism''' is an event that links two [[chronology|chronologies]]. For example, it is used in [[Egyptology]] to ground [[Egyptian chronology]]. The main types of chronological synchronism are synchronisms with other historical chronologies and synchronisms with precisely datable astronomical events.

Synchronisms with other chronologies often rely on some form of recorded communication between regions. For example, in Egyptology, the earliest such synchronisms appear in the 15th century BC, during the [[Amarna Period]] by the considerable quantity of diplomatic correspondence between [[Amenhotep III]] and [[Akhenaten]] and various [[Near Eastern]] monarchs; that links Egyptian chronology with other Near Eastern chronologies.

Astronomical synchronisms rely on precise identification of astronomical events recorded in the historical record. The best known of these is the [[Sothic cycle]] whose careful study led [[Richard Anthony Parker]] to argue that the dates of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt]] could be fixed with absolute precision.&lt;ref&gt;Set forth in "Excursus C: The Twelfth dynasty" in his ''The Calendars of ancient Egypt'' (Chicago: University Press, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has eroded that confidence and questioned many of the assumptions used with the Sothic Cycle. As a result, experts have moved away from relying on it.&lt;ref&gt;One example is Patrick O'Mara, "Censorinus, the Sothic Cycle, and calendar year one in ancient Egypt: the Epistological problem", ''Journal of Near Eastern studies'', '''62''' (2003), pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''''' (titled '''''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive''''' for the British edition) is a 2005 book by academic and popular science author [[Jared Diamond]], in which Diamond first defines ''collapse'':  "a drastic decrease in human population size and/or political/economic/social complexity, over a considerable area, for an extended time."  He then reviews the causes of historical and pre-historical instances of [[societal collapse]] — particularly those involving significant influences from [[environmental change]]s, the effects of [[climate change]], hostile neighbors, [[international trade|trade partners,]] and the society's response to the foregoing four challenges— and considers the success or failure different societies have had in coping with such threats.

While the bulk of the book is concerned with the demise of these historical civilizations, Diamond also argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Easter-island-moai.jpg|thumb|Diamond says [[Easter Island]] provides the best historical example of a societal collapse in isolation.]]

In the prologue, Jared Diamond summarizes his [[methodology]] in one paragraph:
{{quote|text=This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which [[environmental problems]] contribute. My previous book (''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''), had applied the comparative method to the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other "input" variables postulated to influence a society's stability. The "output" variables that I examine are collapse or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Collapses of past societies ===

Diamond identifies five factors that contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbours, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society's response to the forgoing four factors.

The root problem in all but one of Diamond's factors leading to collapse is [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.

Diamond also writes about cultural factors (values), such as the apparent reluctance of the [[Greenlandic Norse people|Greenland Norse]] to eat fish. Diamond also states that "it would be absurd to claim that [[environmental damage]] must be a major factor in all collapses: the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] is a modern counter-example, and the [[destruction of Carthage]] by [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in 146 BC is an ancient one. It's obviously true that military or economic factors alone may suffice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern societies ===
{{See also|Planetary boundaries}}

He also lists twelve [[List of environmental issues|environmental problems]] facing humankind today. The first eight have historically contributed to the collapse of past societies:
# [[Deforestation]] and [[habitat destruction]]
# [[Soil]] problems ([[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], and [[soil fertility]] losses)
# [[Water management]] problems
# [[Overhunting]]
# [[Overfishing]]
# Effects of [[introduced species]] on [[native species]]
# [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]]
# Increased per-capita impact of people

Further, he says four new factors may contribute to the weakening and collapse of present and future societies:

&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[Anthropogenic climate change]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Buildup of [[toxin]]s in the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; [[energy crisis|Energy shortages]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Full human use of the Earth’s [[photosynthetic]] capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

=== Conclusions ===
In the last chapter, he discusses environmental problems facing modern societies and addresses objections that are often given to dismiss the importance of environmental problems (section "One-liner objections"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", pages 503-514 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;). In the "Further readings" section, he gives suggestions to people who ask "What can I do as an individual?".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, "Further readings" section of the chapter 16, pages 569-574 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws conclusions, such as:
{{Block quote|In fact, one of the main lesson to be learned from the collapses of the Maya, Anasazi, Easter Islanders, and those other past societies [...] is that a society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. [...] The reason is simple: maximum population, wealth, [[resource consumption]], and waste production mean maximum environmental impact, approaching the limit where impact outstrips resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?"section "One-liner objections", page 509 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Finally, he answers the question, "What are the choices that we must make if we are to succeed, and not to fail?" by identifying two crucial choices distinguishing the past societies that failed from those that survived:&lt;ref name=Choices&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive'', Penguin Books, 2011, chapter "The world as a polder: what does it all mean to us today?", section "Reasons for hope", pages 522-524 ({{ISBN|978-0-241-95868-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long-term planning: "[...] the courage to practice long-term thinking, and to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions."&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;
* Willingness to reconsider core values: "[...] the courage to make painful decisions about values. Which of the values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained under new changed circumstances? Which of these treasured values must instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?"&lt;ref name=Choices/&gt;

''Collapse'' is divided into four parts.
*Part One describes the environment of the US state of [[Montana]], focusing on the lives of several individuals to put a human face on the interplay between society and the environment.
*Part Two describes past societies that have collapsed. Diamond uses a "framework" when considering the collapse of a society, consisting of five "sets of factors" that may affect what happens to a society: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of [[trade|trading partners]], and the society's  responses to its environmental problems. A recurrent problem in collapsing societies is a structure that creates "a conflict between the short-term interests of those in power, and the long-term interests of the society as a whole." 

The societies Diamond describes are:

* The [[Greenland]] [[Norsemen|Norse]] (cf. [[Hvalsey Church]]) (climate change, environmental damage, loss of trading partners,  hostile neighbors, irrational reluctance to eat fish, chiefs looking after their short-term interests).  
* [[Easter Island]] (a society that [[History_of_Easter_Island#Destruction_of_society_and_population|collapsed]] entirely due to environmental damage)
* The [[Polynesia]]ns of [[Pitcairn Island]] (environmental damage and loss of trading partners)
* The [[Anasazi]] of southwestern North America (environmental damage and climate change)
* The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of Central America (environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors)
* Finally, Diamond discusses three past success stories:
** The tiny egalitarian Pacific island of [[Tikopia]]
** The agricultural success of egalitarian central [[New Guinea]]
** The [[forest management]] in stratified [[Japan#Ecoregions|Japan]] of the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]]-era, and in [[Germany]].

*Part Three examines modern societies, including:
** The [[Rwandan genocide|collapse into genocide of Rwanda]], caused in part by overpopulation
** The failure of [[Haiti]] compared with the relative success of its neighbor on [[Hispaniola]], the [[Dominican Republic]]
** The problems facing a [[developing country|developing nation]], [[China]]
** The problems facing a [[First World]] nation, [[Australia]]
*Part Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and [[globalization]], and "extracts practical lessons for us today" (pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23). Specific attention is given to the [[polder model]] as a way [[Dutch people|Dutch]] society has addressed its challenges and the "top-down" and most importantly "bottom-up" approaches that we must take now that "our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course" (p.&amp;nbsp;498) in order to avoid the "12 problems of [[Sustainability|non-sustainability]]" that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees "signs of hope" nevertheless and arrives at a position of "cautious optimism" for all our futures.

==Reviews==
[[Tim Flannery]] gave ''Collapse'' the highest praise in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', writing:&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Flannery]], [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5706/45.full "Learning from the past to change our future"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', volume 307, 7 January 2005, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=While he planned the book, Diamond at first thought that it would deal only with human impacts on the environment. Instead, what has emerged is arguably the most incisive study of senescing human civilizations ever written. [...] the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that ''Collapse'' must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.}}

''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the [[future]]. Secondly, the reviewer claimed ''Collapse'' contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond purportedly overstated the number of [[Starvation|starving]] people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3555894 "History on an environmental scale. Of porpoises and plantations. When communities self-destruct"], ''[[The Economist]]'', volume 374, 13 January 2005, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of British Columbia]] professor of [[ecological planning]] [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] wrote that ''Collapse''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile, able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreover, Rees wrote that ''Collapse'' is "a necessary antidote" to followers of [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]], such as [[Bjørn Lomborg]] who authored ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''. Rees explained this assertion as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]], [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7021/full/433015a.html "Contemplating the abyss"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', volume 433'', 6 January 2005, pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Human behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, ''Collapse'', confronts this contradiction head-on.}}

[[Jennifer Marohasy]] of the [[think-tank]] [[Institute of Public Affairs]] wrote a critical review in ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'', in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennifer Marohasy]], [http://www.ipa.org.au/library/EE%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf "Australia's Environment: Undergoing Renewal, Not Collapse"] (PDF), ''Energy and Environment'' 16 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Malcolm Gladwell]] highlights the way Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/03/050103crbo_books?currentPage=1 "The Vanishing"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 2005-01-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Diamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.}}

While Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.

Jared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage and cultural inflexibility is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists, who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and [[slave raiding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Benny Peiser|author-link=Benny Peiser|year=2005|title=From Genocide to Ecocide: The Rape of Rapa Nui|journal= [[Energy &amp; Environment]] |volume= 16 No. 3&amp;4|url=http://archive.4edu.info/Youth_2007/ESY_06.5_From_Genocide_to_Ecocide.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline, and that introduced animals—first rats and then sheep—were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora, which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930–1960.&lt;ref&gt;Terry L. Hunt and Carl P. Lipo, [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5767/1603.full "Late Colonization of Easter Island"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 9 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Questioning Collapse'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) is a collection of essays by anthropologists criticizing various aspects of Diamond's books ''Collapse'' and ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1145682|title = Review: Questioning Collapse|last = Flexner|first = James L.|date = December 2011|journal = Pacific Affairs|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|volume = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
In 2010, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] released the documentary film ''Collapse'' based on Diamond's book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715324/ ''Collapse: Based on the Book by Jared Diamond'', [[Internet Movie Database]] (page visited on 10 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26059223&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">A '''concert party''', also called a '''Pierrot troupe''', is the collective name for a group of entertainers, or [[Pierrot#England 2|Pierrots]], popular in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the first half of the 20th century. The [[variety show]] given by a Pierrot troupe was called a '''Pierrot show'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb029ms225 |title=Papers relating to English concert parties and pierrot shows |publisher=[[Archives Hub]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-end-of-the-pierrot-show-1087139.html |title=Theatre: End of the pierrot show |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=14 April 1999 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concert parties were travelling shows of songs and comedy, often put on at the seaside and opening with a Pierrot
number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English filming, English writing |last=Jefferson Hunter |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |isbn= |page=226 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbnHvxuby54C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=A+concert+party,+also+called+a+Pierrot+troupe,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iM3dTq-xJ4n54QSD28XTBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1891, the singer and banjoist Clifford Essex returned from France, having admired the Pierrots he had seen there, and decided to create a troupe of English Pierrot entertainers. Thus began the tradition of seaside Pierrots in [[pointed hat]]s and black or coloured costumes who sang, danced, juggled, and joked on the piers of [[Brighton]], [[Margate]] and [[Blackpool]] from the 1890s until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;See Pertwee.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of performance attracted artists from [[music hall]] and variety theatre. Some performers, such as [[Neville Kennard]], were known as specialists in the field.

Immensely popular in Great Britain from the 1920s to the 1940s, concert parties were also formed by several countries' [[armed forces]] during the First and [[Second World War]]s. During the Second World War, the British Armed Forces' concert party became known as the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA), later succeeded by the [[Combined Services Entertainment]] (CSE).

As other forms of entertainment (particularly [[television]]) replaced variety shows in general, concert parties largely died out during the 1950s. This form of entertainment has been described by [[Roy Hudd]] as long-gone and much lamented.&lt;ref name="Hudd"&gt;Roy Hudd, Philip Hindin, ''Roy Hudd's cavalcade of variety acts: a who was who of light entertainment, 1945-60'', 1997, p94&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous fictitious concert party outside the armed forces was ''[[The Good Companions]]'' in [[J. B. Priestley]]'s eponymous novel. In the novel [[Sylvia Scarlett]], the main characters ([[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the film version) form a concert party, The Pink Pierrots.

The '''Council of [[Paderborn]]''' of 785, debating the matter of the [[Charlemagne#Saxon Wars|Christianization of the Saxons]], resolved to make punishable by law all sorts of [[idolatry]], as well as the belief in the existence of [[witchcraft]]. It ordered the death penalty for self-appointed [[witch hunt|witch-hunters]] who had caused the death of persons accused of witchcraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Demythologization''' as a [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] approach to religious texts seeks to separate cosmological and historic claims from philosophical, ethical and theological teachings. [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884-1976) introduced the term ''demythologization'' (in German: ''[[w:de:Entmythologisierung|Entmythologisierung]]'') in this context,&lt;ref&gt;
Rudolf Bultmann, ''New Testament and Mythology and Other Basic Writings'' (1984), p. 3
&lt;/ref&gt;
but the concept has earlier precedents.

== Spinoza's hermeneutic approach to Scripture ==
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|right|142px|[[Baruch Spinoza]]]]
In his 1677 ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] argues that any event in Scripture which is inconsistent with natural laws must be interpreted either as unreliable testimony or as a metaphorical or allegorical representation of a moral teaching. Because the masses are "wholly ignorant of the workings of nature",&lt;ref&gt;6:22&lt;/ref&gt; they are prone to interpret any natural event they can't explain as a miracle, and this "ridiculous way of expressing ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;6:36&lt;/ref&gt; often finds its way into Scripture. Scripture aims not at narrating things in terms of their natural causes, but rather at exciting the "popular imagination" in order to "impress the minds of the masses with devotion."&lt;ref&gt;6:73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore it speaks inaccurately of God and of events, seeing that its object is not to convince the reason, but to attract and lay hold of the imagination. If the Bible were to describe the destruction of an empire in the style of political historians, the masses would remain unstirred.&lt;ref&gt;6:85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order to correctly interpret scripture we must understand the opinions and judgments of the ancients and learn common "Jewish phrases and metaphors."&lt;ref&gt;6:105&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise we will be prone to "confound actual events with symbolical and imaginary ones."&lt;ref&gt;6:98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many things are narrated in Scripture as real, and were believed to be real, which were in fact only symbolical and imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;6:98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Kant's ''Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone'' ==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|142px|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1793 ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason|Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone]]'' argues that the [[New Testament]] teaches a hermeneutic strategy in which "not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law's interpreter."&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 1, Section 1, “The Christian religion as a natural religion,” as translated by Theodore M. Greene&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jesus] claims that not the observance of outer civil or statutory churchly duties but the pure moral disposition of the heart alone can make man well-pleasing to God (Mt 5:20-48); … that injury done one’s neighbor can be repaired only through satisfaction rendered to the neighbor himself, not through acts of divine worship (Mt 5:24). Thus, he says, does he intend to do full justice to the Jewish law (Mt 5:17); whence it is obvious that not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law’s interpreter, for taken according to the letter, it allowed the very opposite of all this.&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 1, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kant understood the [[Pharisees]] to have interpreted the [[Old Testament]] as a statutory religion, and he claims that the New Testament intends to replace statutory religion with a "moral religion," which combines all duties into a single universal rule, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 1, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever, over and above good life-conduct, man fancies that he can do to become well-pleasing to God is mere religious delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 2, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Such delusions, Kant argues, must be abandoned to fulfill the New Testament's demand for a rational religion.

== Bultmann's ''New Testament and Mythology'' ==
[[File:Rudolf Bultmann Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|142px|[[Rudolf Bultmann]]]]
The German theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argues in his 1941 ''New Testament and Mythology'' that it is no longer plausible to demand that Christians accept the "mythical world picture" of the [[New Testament]].&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot use electric lights and radios and, in the event of illness, avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament and Mythology and Other Basic Writings'' (1984), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To interpret New Testament mythology in cosmological terms, as a description of the universe, is not plausible. This interpretation must be superseded by an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] interpretation that "discloses the truth of the [[kerygma]] as kerygma for those who do not think mythologically."&lt;ref&gt;p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Can the Christian proclamation today expect men and women to acknowledge the mythical world picture as true? To do so would be both pointless and impossible. It would be pointless because there is nothing specifically Christian about the mythical world picture, which is simply the world picture of a time now past which was not yet formed by scientific thinking. It would be impossible because no one can appropriate a world picture by sheer resolve, since it is already given with one’s historical situation.&lt;ref&gt;p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Surat al-Kahf (surah 18), verses 83-101 ==
[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The Caspian Gates in [[Derbent]], Russia, part of the defence systems built by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns, often identified with the Gates of Alexander]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn is related in chapter 18 ([[Surat al-Kahf]], "The Cave") of the Quran. This chapter was revealed to Muhammad when his tribe, Quraysh, sent two men to discover whether the Jews, with their superior knowledge of the scriptures, could advise them on whether Muhammad was a true prophet of God. The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them "about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story". "If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit." (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope="row"|18:83-98]]).

The verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhul-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:

==The Alexander Romance and Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Alexander the Great shown wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]].]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn has its origins in legends of [[Alexander the Great]] current in the Middle East in the early years of the Christian era. According to these legends the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements of the legend are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The [[Alexander Romance]] went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}

Alexander was already known as "the two-horned one" in these early legends.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57}} The reasons for this are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity ("horn") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the "Land of Gog and Magog" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Dhul-Qarneyn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities ("qarns", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} In the west he finds the sun setting in a "muddy spring", equivalent to the "poisonous sea" which Alexander found in the Syriac legend. {{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the Syriac original Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran changes this into a general administration of justice.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the east both the Syrian legend and the Quran have Alexander/Dhul-Qarneyn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}

"Qarn" also means "period" or "century", and the name Dhul-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as "He of the Two Ages", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}

==Dhul Qarnayn in later literature==

Dhul-Qarnayn the traveller was a favourite subject for later writers. In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī, 1058–1111) wrote of how Dhul-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}

The [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhul Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the "mother" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhul Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhul Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}

The Malay-language ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]'' traces the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families, such as the [[Sumatra]] [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] royalty,&lt;ref&gt;Early Modern History {{ISBN|981-3018-28-3}} page 60&lt;/ref&gt; from Iskandar Zulkarnain,&lt;ref name="(Malaysia)1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Balai Seni Lukis Negara (Malaysia) |title=Seni dan nasionalisme: dulu &amp; kini |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZL-fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&amp;dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain |year=1999 |publisher=Balai Seni Lukis Negara}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Raja [[Rajendra Chola]] (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.&lt;ref name="TasaiDjamari2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S.

==People identified with Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:100_manat._Türkmenistan,_2009_a.jpg|thumb|[[Oghuz Khan]] pictured with two horns as Zulqarnayn on a 100 [[Turkmenistan]] [[Turkmenistan manat|manat]] banknote.]]
{{also|Cyrus the Great in the Quran}}
Muslim and other commentators have identified Dhul Qarnayn with [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]],{{sfn|Netton|2006|p=72-73}} but some have objected that this cannot be so: Alexander lived only a short time, whereas Dhul-Qarnayn lived for 700 years as a sign of God's blessing; Alexander behaved very badly while Dhul-Qarnayn was a paragon; and Dhul-Qarnayn worshiped [[Allah|only one god]], while Alexander worshiped many.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.2}} Other candidates have been suggested:

*[[Cyrus the Great]], the 6th century BCE [[Achaemenid Persia]]n conqueror.
*[[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr|Imru'l-Qays]] (died 328 CE), a prince of the [[Lakhmids]] of southern Mesopotamia, an ally first of Persia and then of Rome, celebrated in romance for his exploits.{{sfn|Ball|2002|p=97-98}}
*"[[Messiah ben Joseph]]", a fabulous military saviour expected by [[Yemenite Jew]]s and associated in folk-lore with [[Dhu Nawas]], a semi-legendary 6th century Yemenite king.{{sfn|Wasserstrom|2014|p=61-62}}

It is named for the [[Fashoda incident]] (1898) which is judged to have given rise to it. In ''[[The State of Africa]]'', the [[British people|British]] historian [[Martin Meredith]] says:

:"Ever since an incident in the Sudanese village of Fashoda ... the French had been vigilant in guarding against anglophone encroachment in what they considered to be their own backyard &amp;mdash; ''le pré carré''. In his memoirs, [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]] listed the disasters that had afflicted France in his youth and that had led him to devote himself to upholding France's 'grandeur': the first on the list was the Fashoda incident. The 'Fashoda syndrome', as it was known, formed a basic component of France's Africa policy. To ensure that African issues received due attention, the French presidential office included a special Africa Unit &amp;mdash; ''Cellule Africaine'' &amp;mdash; with a wide remit to cover everything from intelligence work to bribery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Meredith |authorlink=Martin Meredith |title=[[The State of Africa]]: A History of Fifty Years of Independence |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |date=2006 |page=493 |isbn=9780743232210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meredith judges that the 1990 French intervention in [[Rwanda]] was an expression of the "syndrome". Rwanda lies on the border between "[[Francophone]]" and "[[English-speaking|Anglophone]]" Africa. In 1990, there was a short-lived invasion by the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a coalition of [[Tutsi]] exiles and those advocating democratic reform. Many of the RPF had grown up in Tutsi refugee camps in formerly British-controlled [[Uganda]] and had learned to fight in the [[Uganda]]n army, and Uganda was seen by Paris as being, at that time, within the British sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brauman|first=Rony|title=Devant le mal.

The Fashoda complex has been used in connection with foreign policies of other countries, particularly [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Waterbury"/&gt;

The '''February Countercurrent''' ({{zh|c=二月逆流|p=''Èryuè nìliú''}}), also known as the '''February Adverse Current'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|title=Resolution on CPC History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, refers to the joint efforts by a group of [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] veterans to oppose the ultra-leftist radicalism at the beginning of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The events refer mainly to a series of stormy meetings of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]] and the top military brass which took place between January and February, 1967, which pitted Communist revolutionary generals [[Tan Zhenlin]], [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]], [[Xu Xiangqian]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], and others against Maoist radicals led by [[Lin Biao]], [[Kang Sheng]], [[Jiang Qing]], and [[Zhang Chunqiao]]. The veterans asserted that the Cultural Revolution was throwing the country into chaos and that its real aim was to purge the top leadership of the party and the military. Mao did not come into face-to-face conflict with the generals but tacitly disapproved of their actions. The generals were denounced by Lin Biao at the Twelfth Plenum of the 8th Party Congress in October 1968 as a "serious anti-party act".&lt;ref name=duowei&gt;{{cite news|title=多维历史：陈丕显亲述二月逆流真相|url=http://history.dwnews.com/news/2013-08-08/59303667-all.html|publisher=''Duowei News''|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Mao backtracked on the official designation given to the February Countercurrent after the death of Chen Yi at a time when Mao felt increasingly politically isolated. Mao rushed out of bed to make an impromptu appearance at Chen Yi's funeral, signalling his attempt to reach out to the old comrades who have been purged or otherwise harmed during the Cultural Revolution.

The post-Mao Communist Party reversed the verdict on the February Countercurrent; it is rarely discussed in mainland China today.

'''"The Franklin Prophecy"''', sometimes called "The Franklin Forgery", is an [[antisemitic]] speech falsely attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], warning of the supposed dangers of admitting [[Jews]] to the nascent [[United States]].  The speech was purportedly transcribed by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, but was unknown before its appearance in 1934 in the pages of [[William Dudley Pelley|William Dudley Pelley's]] [[Silver Legion]] pro-[[Nazi]] weekly magazine ''Liberation''.  No evidence exists for the document's authenticity, and some of the author's claims have actively been disproven.

The setting for the speech is a dinner table discussion purportedly recorded by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the convention of the [[Continental Congress]].  Primarily, it is a polemic arguing against admitting Jewish immigration into the newly formed United States. The text is as follows:&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

{{quote|There is a great danger for the United State of America. This great danger is the Jew. Gentlemen, in every land the Jews have settled, they have depressed the moral level and lowered the degree of commercial honesty. They have remained apart and unassimilated; oppressed, they attempt to strangle the nation financially, as in the case of Portugal and Spain.

For more than seventeen hundred years they have lamented their sorrowful fate — namely, that they have been driven out of their mother land; but, gentlemen, if the civilized world today should give them back Palestine and their property, they would immediately find pressing reason for not returning there. Why? Because they are vampires and vampires cannot live on other vampires --they cannot live among themselves. They must live among Christians and others who do not belong to their race.

If they are not expelled from the United States by the Constitution within less than one hundred years, they will stream into this country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us and change our form of Government for which we Americans shed our blood and sacrificed our life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded within two hundred years, our children will be working in the field to feed Jews while they remain in the counting houses, gleefully rubbing their hands.

I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews forever, your children and your children’s children will curse you in their graves. Their ideas are not those of Americans, even when they lived among us for ten generations. The leopard cannot change his spots. The Jews are a danger to this land, and if they are allowed to enter, they will imperil our institutions. They should be excluded by the Constitution.}}

==Authenticity==
According to Pelley, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney wrote that he had kept a journal of the Convention, but it has never been found; no evidence exists for Pelley's claim that it was printed privately.  The Franklin Institute has rejected Pelley's claims that it owns a manuscript copy of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/306346 Benjamin Franklin vindicated: an exposure of the Franklin "prophecy"] by [[American Jewish Congress]], 1938, p. 9-10 via [[Archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] report ''Anti-Semitism in Europe: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations'' (2004) states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Franklin "Prophecy" is a classic anti-Semitic canard that falsely claims that American statesman Benjamin Franklin made anti-Jewish statements during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. It has found widening acceptance in Muslim and Arab media, where it has been used to criticize Israel and Jews...&lt;ref&gt;''Anti-Semitism in Europe: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations''. United States Congress. Senate. Committee on Foreign Relations. Subcommittee on European Affairs. 2004. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Franklin was a friend to the Jews of 18th-century America,&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp "The Franklin "Prophecy": Modern Anti-Semitic Myth Making"], ''Facts''. Anti-Defamation League. April–May 1954. Retrieved January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed toward the building of Philadelphia's first permanent synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikvehisrael.org/e2_cms_display.php?p=past_our_history "Our History"]. Mikveh Israel. Retrieved January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] noted that the reference to a return to Palestine was an [[anachronism]], since the modern [[Zionist]] movement did not arise until nearly a century after Franklin's death.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

Similar antisemitic quotations have been attributed to [[George Washington]] and have been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/quotes/washington/enemies.asp "To Bigotry, No Sanction"]. Snopes. March 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, in a marked sign of religious tolerance, Washington sent a letter to the [[Jew]]ish community in [[Rhode Island]], writing "May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid."&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirschfeld|first=Fritz|title=George Washington and the Jews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-250L02b4EMC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=January 31, 2006|year=2005|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-927-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Despite having been repeatedly discredited since its first appearance, the "prophecy" has proved a remarkably durable [[antisemitic canard]]. It has appeared most recently as a popular [[Hoax|Internet hoax]] promulgated on [[Usenet]] groups and antisemitic websites, where it is presented as authentic. On February 18, 1998, a member of the [[Central Committee of Fatah|Fatah Central Committee]] revived this myth and mistakenly referred to Franklin as a former [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/arab/anti_sem_myth.asp "The Franklin 'Prophecy': American Anti-Semitic Myth Finds Acceptance in Arab World"], Anti-Defamation League. March 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama Bin Laden]] used this canard briefly in his October 2002 "[[Letter to the American People]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldview/story/0,,845725,00.html "Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'"], ''The Guardian''. November 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''From Atlantis to the Sphinx''''' is a work of non-fiction by British author, [[Colin Wilson]], with the subheading  ''Recovering the Lost Wisdom of the Ancient World''.

Wilson proposes in the text that the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] was constructed by a technologically advanced people "nearly 10,000 years before [[Egyptologists]] have hypothesized" by the same people who provided plans for the construction of the pyramids of Egypt, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Central]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67741948.html|title = Book Thickens the Riddle of the Sphinx|last = Graham|first = Mark|date = 6 November 1997|work = [[Rocky Mt. News|Rocky Mountain News]]|access-date = 2015-08-02|via = [[Highbeam Research]]|location = Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book explores the connection between [[astronomy]] and [[mythology]], arguing that ancient man used "Lunar knowledge" (intuition) as opposed to modern man's "Solar knowledge" (logic) to interpret the universe and therefore possessed an entirely different but equally valid mentality from that of modern man. Wilson proposes that the outlook of ancient man was based on "seeing the big picture" rather than logically breaking down the universe into its constituent parts.

Wilson develops this idea of civilisations founded on Lunar Knowledge together with astronomy to explain the monumental and seemingly spontaneous achievements of ancient cultures such as the [[Pyramids of Giza|Pyramid Complex]] at [[Giza]] in Egypt.

Wilson argues that the essential weakness of [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' is that Frazer attributed the fundamental mythological systems to the beginnings of the farming cultures, specifically to fertility. Agreeing with [[Giorgio de Santillana]]'s thesis developed in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'', Wilson places the genesis of mythology previous to fertility cultures, linking the fundamental myths to astronomical occurrences such as the [[Precession of the Equinoxes]].

The main observations drawn by Wilson are that our ancient pre-''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ancestors possessed intelligence equal to that of modern man, their apparent lack of technological achievement being explained by the needlessness of it based on their completely different, intuitive and all-embracing mentality. Over time, a more logical and dissecting mentality evolved leading to the traits which mark modern civilisations.

The term 'bourgeois' is used derogatorily to describe anything considered humdrum, unimaginative and/or selfishly materialistic
* '''[[Bronze Age]]''' – In Britain, this was the period – from about 2300 to 700 BC – when metal first began to be widely used, possibly as a result of the increase in contact with Europe. However, various types of stone, particularly flint, remained very important for long after metal became available. The Bronze Age saw the introduction of cremation of the dead and burials in round barrows. The later (and best known) phases of construction at Stonehenge also date from this period

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">The '''Göttingen school of history''' was a group of historians associated with a particular style of historiography located at the [[University of Göttingen]] in the late [[18th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gierl|first=Martin|title=Scholars in Action (2 vols): The Practice of Knowledge and the Figure of the Savant in the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtV2nJcVolQC&amp;pg=PA285|date=3 May 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-24391-7|page=285|chapter=Change of Paradigm as a Squabble between Institutions|quote=The term “Gottingen school of history" refers not to student-teacher relations nor to a shared methodology, but precisely to this field of competition in historical, cultural and anthropological interpretation, which emerged in Gottingen in the second half of the eighteenth century as an institutional effect of the Gottingen university, and which is captivating not for its shared attitude, but for its vigorous activity emanating from all of the university’s areas of expertise in all areas of contemporary cultural-historical debate - which, as a political and cultural identity debate, was at the centre of discourse in the late Enlightenment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group of historians played an important role in creating a "scientific" basis for historical research,&lt;ref name="Cheng2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheng|first=Eileen K.|title=The Plain and Noble Garb of Truth: Nationalism &amp; Impartiality in American Historical Writing, 1784-1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9-dg5Zh8n4wC&amp;pg=PA362|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3073-0|pages=362–|quote=…historians of the Gottingen school also played an important role in establishing the basis for critical scholarship and a more “scientific” approach to history during the second half of the eighteenth century as they used their training in philology and statistics and in what were considered the “auxiliary sciences" of paleography and numismatics to analyze historical data.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were also responsible for coining two fundamental groups of terminologies in [[scientific racism]]:
*Blumenbach and Meiners's [[color terminology for race]]: [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] or white race; [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] or yellow race; [[Malay race|Malayan]] or brown race; [[Negroid race|Ethiopian]] or black race; and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]] or red race;&lt;ref&gt;''The End of Racism'' by Dinesh D'Souza, pg 124, 1995, "Blumenbach's classification had a lasting influence in part because his categories neatly broke down into familiar tones and colors: white, black, yellow, red, and brown."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gatterer, Schlözer and Eichhorn's [[Generations of Noah|Biblical terminology for race]]: [[Semitic people|Semitic]], [[Hamitic]] and [[Japhetic]].

The University of Göttingen was the original centre of the "[[:de:Geschichtswissenschaft|Geschichtswissenschaft]]" or history as an academic discipline, and became a major centre for globally-orientated anthropology.&lt;ref name="Burns2006"/&gt; The school itself was one of the newest universities in Europe, having been founded in 1734 by [[:de:Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen|Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen]], and the first to require the obligation to conduct and publish research alongside lecturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Demel|first=Walter|title=Race and Racism in Modern East Asia: Western and Eastern Constructions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HTMyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=1 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-23741-4|pages=68–|quote=In order to explain this concept and its changes, one must consider the intellectual situation of Göttingen. A university had been founded in this Lower Saxony town in 1736-37. Here, for the first time. the task of giving lectures was combined with the obligation to conduct and publish research. Göttingen soon became known as a center of “universal” historiography which - under English influence - flourished there… Being a center of global history, Göttingen became a hub for globally oriented anthropology as well. Or, to express it with a slight exaggeration: It became what would be called in German the most important ‘’Hexenküche’’ [witch’s kitchen] of racial theories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historians of this school sought to write a [[universal history]] by combining the critical methods of [[Jean Mabillon]] with that of the philosophical historians such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Edward Gibbon]].&lt;ref name="Ranke2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Iggers|first=Georg|title=The Theory and Practice of History: Edited with an Introduction by Georg G.

Niebuhr and Ranke refined the concern with critical method, Ranke in the process narrowed the universality of the outlook of the Gottingen historians. What Ranke brought to history was less a new method - this had been developed to a great extent by the Gottingen school - than a greater emphasis on the professional and technical character of history and a conception of history that we shall discuss later in this Introduction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Historical anthropology''' is a [[historiographical]] movement which applies methodologies and objectives from [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]] to the study of historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Like most such movements, it is understood in different ways by different scholars, and to some may be synonymous with the [[history of mentalities]], [[cultural history]], [[ethnohistory]], [[microhistory]], [[People's history|history from below]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]''. Anthropologists whose work has been particularly inspirational to historical anthropology include [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Arnold van Gennep]], [[Jack Goody]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] has contrasted historical anthropology with [[Social History]], finding that historical anthropology tends to focus on qualitative rather than quantitative data, smaller communities, and symbolic aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; Thus it reflects a turn away, in the 1960s, in [[Marxist historiography]] from 'the orthodox Marxist approach to human behaviour in which actors are seen as motivated in the first instance by economics, and only secondarily by culture or ideology', in the work of historians such as [[E. P. Thompson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt;

Historical anthropology was rooted in the [[Annales School]], associated with a succession of major historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pierre Nora]], along with researchers from elsewhere on the Continent such as [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. The label ''historical anthropology'' has been actively promoted by some recent Annales School historians, such as [[Jean-Claude Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Claude Schmitt |url=https://cem.revues.org/8862 |title=Anthropologie historique |publisher=Cem.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acrh.revues.org/1926 |title=L’anthropologie historique de l’Occident médiéval. Un parcours |publisher=Acrh.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1929 by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], the review [[Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales]] is still among the most influential French publications for research in historical anthropology.

Historical anthropology has been open to similar criticisms to anthropology: 'as [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] and [[John Comaroff|John]] and [[Jean Comaroff]] have observed, studies in which societies were represented in this way were often partial, biased, and unwitting handmaidens to the domination of non-Western peoples by Europeans and Americans'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; But since the Second World War, increasingly reflexive approaches have led to sophisticated developments of the field, and the banner of 'historical anthropology' has often attracted Anglo-American historians in ways that the Annales School did not: key figures have been [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Jay O'Brien (anthropologist)|Jay O'Brien]], [[William Roseberry]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Jane Schneider]], [[Peter Schneider (historian)|Peter Schneider]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], and people from elsewhere in the world such as [[Aaron Gurevich]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">'''Historical determinism''' is the stance that events are historically predetermined or currently constrained by various forces. Historical determinism can be understood in contrast to its negation, i.e. the rejection of historical determinism.

Some political philosophies (e.g. Early and Stalinist [[Marxism]]) assert a [[historical materialism]] of either predetermination or constraint, or both.

Used as a pejorative, it is normally meant to designate an overdetermination of present possibilities by historical conditions.

The '''''History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence''''' (abbreviated to '''''History of the Great War''''' or '''''British Official History''''') is a series of {{nowrap|109 volumes,}} concerning the war effort of the British state during the [[First World War]].  It was produced by the Historical Section of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] from 1915 to 1949; after 1919 [[Brigadier-General]] [[James Edward Edmonds|Sir James Edmonds]] was Director. Edmonds wrote many of the army volumes and influenced the choice of historians for the navy, air force, medical and veterinary volumes. Work had begun on the series in 1915 and in 1920, the first volumes of ''Naval Operations'' and ''Seaborne Trade'', were published. The first "army" publication, ''Military Operations: France and Belgium 1914'' Part I and a separate map case were published in 1922 and the final volume, ''The Occupation of Constantinople'' was published in 2010.

The ''History of the Great War'' Military Operations volumes were originally intended as a technical history for military staff. Single-volume popular histories of military operations and naval operations written by civilian writers, were to be produced for the general public but Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] was dismissed for slow work on the military volume and his draft was not published. Edmonds preferred to appoint [[half-pay]] and retired officers, who were cheaper than civilian writers and wrote that occasionally the "'War House' foisted elderly officers on him, because they were not going to be promoted or offered employment but was afraid to tell them so".

In the 1987 introduction to ''Operations in Persia 1914–1919'', G. M. Bayliss wrote that the guides issued by [[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO) were incomplete. "Sectional List number 60" of 1976 omitted the ''Gallipoli'' volumes but contained ''The Blockade of the Central Empires'' (1937), that had been ''Confidential'' and retained "For Official Use Only" until 1961. The twelve volume ''History of the Ministry of Munitions'', the ''Occupation of the Rhineland'' (1929) and ''Operations in Persia 1914–1919'' (1929) were included. The [[Imperial War Museum]] Department of Printed Books and the Battery Press republished the official history in the 1990s with black and white maps. The Department of Printed Books and the Naval and Military Press republished the set in paperback with colour maps in the 2000s and on [[DVD]]-[[Read-only memory|ROM]] in the 2010s.

==Background==

===Official history===

The modern form of official military history began in the mid-nineteenth century with reports written as guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, were not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that its official histories should be written for the public, since it had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war to inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing explicit lessons from their successes and failures.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}}

None of the points of view to be served by the production of official history is immune to error, because work by a military historian could be fraudulent, distorting the record for personal or political reasons. Populist history can dilute the story to the point of worthlessness and civilian academics can be prone to select facts and interpretations according to their ideals, ideology and preconceived ideas. Military histories written as textbooks might be expected to have a basis in truth, necessary to teach useful lessons to students and the British ''Report of the Committee on the Lessons of the Great War'' ([[Walter Kirke|Kirk Report]], 1931) drew on the published volumes of the British official history and conclusions in the report were incorporated into a new edition of ''Field Service Regulations''. Operations might again be conducted in Iraq and Iran and official history volumes were produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, rarely referring to those of allied and opposing armies; comparative analysis is absent and national bias, due to ulterior motives like the temptation to myth make, can also be found. The Australian ''[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918]]'' edited by [[Charles Bean]] contains exaggerations of the significance of the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagements of soldiers from Britain and its allies.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}}

Australian failures and casualties are sometimes blamed on British higher commanders, when high-ranking Australian officers could justly be criticised. The post-war [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), was at risk of abolition and needed a function that could not be replicated by the army or navy, to justify its existence. The parts of ''The War in the Air'' (1922–1937) written by H. A. Jones gave undue emphasis to strategic bombing, unbalancing the work.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=9–10}} Embarrassing events can be disguised by underwriting and in the French official history ''Histoire de La Grande Guerre'', the [[French Army Mutinies]] of 1917  were passed over in a few paragraphs in ''Les Armées Françaises dans la Grande Guerre'', despite occurring in {{nowrap|43 percent}} of the French Army. Many of the historians, editors and contributors to the ''History of the Great War'' (1915–1949) had been senior officers during the war, which had the advantage of bringing first-hand knowledge of events and experience of military art to the work but this risked allowing loyalty and an understandable desire to protect reputations leading to unfair blaming, particularly on outsiders.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=10–11}}

The narrative of the [[Battle of Jutland]] (1916) is described in Volume III of the Royal Navy history ''Naval Operations'' (1923). The draft text was revised at the request of some serving officers present at the battle, to remove critical remarks about them. Many of the officers were retired or dead, when a revised edition was published in 1940 but the excised passages were not restored.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=10–11}} The British Army ''Military Operations....'' volumes have been criticised for dishonesty, in not blaming GHQ for the extent of British casualties. The authors have been accused of exculpating Field Marshal Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from December 1915 to the end of the war, by default. In 2011, Neil Wells wrote that as the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, Haig and other commanders escape explicit blame for failures, yet the reader is left free to form conclusions.{{sfn|Wells|2011|pp=11–12}}

===British official history===

In 1906, [[Official history|official histories]] were being written by three departments at the [[War Office]] and one in the [[Admiralty]]. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] chairman of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], suggested that a subcommittee be established as the Historical Section, to centralise the collection of army and navy archives, as a repository of the lessons of war for strategists. Esher thought that the lessons of the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] (11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902) could not be shown unless the naval, military and political aspects of the war were treated as one. In January 1907, the subcommittee was established with Sir [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|George Clarke]] as chairman, charged with the completion of an official history of the Boer War. The original account was begun by Colonel [[George Francis Robert Henderson|G. F. R. Henderson]] (1854–1903), before ill health forced him to retire. Before he died, Henderson had completed a narrative up to the beginning of the war but it was not published. A later version, (''History of the war in South Africa'' 1899–1902, four volumes, 1906–1910) by Major-General [[John Frederick Maurice|J. F. Maurice]] reached publication but had needed a large number of assistants, which increased the price of the book; it was favourably received but did not sell well.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=5–6}}

===Histories of the Great War===
The Historical Section was busy on a history of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) in August 1914 but work was suspended on the outbreak of the First World War. The section began to collect material being returned from France and Lieutenant-Colonel E. Y. Daniel was appointed as a full-time secretary.{{efn|Daniel retired in 1939, at the age of 74.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=6}}}} Experience of writing the history of the South African War, showed that delay made the task impossible and that the collection of material for the work should begin at once. In May 1915, Captain C. T. Atkinson was sent to France to collect unit diaries. Atkinson reported that the diaries were inadequate, because of the difficulty of writing them during events like the [[Great Retreat]] of 1914, when few were kept and that these had big gaps. Although the diaries would not show ''why'' events occurred, Atkinson recommended that they should be indexed and grouped by unit, subject and chronology and that later they could be scrutinised to identify discrepancies caused by the organisation of the material.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=6}}

A formal decision to write an official history was not taken until a Cabinet meeting on 26 August 1915, when [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] (1 April 1877 – 26 January 1963) the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of the War Council, advocated a series of histories to provide

{{quote|...a popular and authoritative guide for the general reader; for the purposes of professional reference and education [and to provide] an antidote to the usual unofficial histories which besides being generally inaccurate, habitually attribute all naval and military failures to the ineptitude of the Government.|Hankey{{sfn|Green|2003|p=6}}}}

Field Marshal [[Herbert Kitchener]] (24 June 1850 – 5 June 1916) the [[Secretary of State for War]] wanted work begun on a single-volume popular history, to be published soon after the war. This would maintain public interest in the main series and put the case of the government, at the same time as accounts by participants and popular authors. The [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] objected over the cost but Hankey considered that it would be a work of education and reference, not a commercial proposition and that if scientific works were judged only on commercial criteria, research would be abolished.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=6–7}}

The Treasury gave way and agreed to finance an official history series and popular single-volume works, written by civilian authors to ensure public appeal. Sir [[Julian Corbett]] (12 November 1854 – 21 September 1922) was appointed to write the navy volume and Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] (28 December 1859 – 22 October 1933) was chosen for the army volume. Work on the military histories was slow and in 1917, Daniel reported that Atkinson and an assistant had examined only {{nowrap|160 of}} {{nowrap|1,100 unit}} diaries and Fortescue had only reached as far as November 1914. The war precluded a big increase in manpower and for the Fortescue volume to be adequate, Daniel reported that confidential staff correspondence would be needed. With the huge increase in the size of the British army, it would only be practical to use some unit diaries and care would be needed to avoid skewing the selection. In March 1919, [[Winston Churchill]] (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) received a pre-publication copy of the Corbett popular history of the navy and objected to certain passages. Churchill wanted official records to be published with the volume so that the public could judge for themselves. Hankey claimed that Churchill's objections made the publication of an official history series questionable, since they would inevitably reflect on leaders, many of whom remained in public life.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=7–8}}

[[File:Winston Churchill by William Orpen, 1916,.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Winston Churchill by William Orpen, 1916}}]]
Hankey wrote that an official history should ''not'' be written, because it would attract parliamentary and public criticism, the length of time taken to publish would mean that each volume would be examined and that the history would be produced at a loss. The experience of producing the navy volume also showed that each publication would

{{quote|...run the gauntlet of departmental criticism which [was] apt to emasculate the work and deprive it of half its interest.|Hankey{{sfn|Green|2003|p=8}}}}

but the objections were not enough to cancel the project, given the benefits of publication. The public knew little of the early stages of the war and it had a right to benefit from the state monopoly on official information, presented in a readable manner. An official history would also serve to educate professional officers, that mattered more than cost and that criticism was unavoidable. Publication would refute unofficial histories that blamed the government or individual officers and for this, the histories could not evade controversy or be inoffensive to individual sensibilities. The Cabinet agreed for publication to continue, subject to vetting by the War Office and the Cabinet, with the proviso that the decision might be reversed if the Corbett volume was badly received; the volume was published in 1920, to extremely good press reviews.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=8}} Work on the military histories in 1919 was hampered by paucity of resources and bad management, until Brigadier-General [[James Edward Edmonds|J. E. Edmonds]] (25 December 1861 – 2 August 1956), who had joined the Historical Section in February 1919, was appointed Director on 1 April. Edmonds found documents in un-catalogued bundles on the floor, from which historians had abstracted items and not replaced them.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=6–7, 9}}

The Fortescue volume was to have covered the war but he wrote so slowly, that it was decided to end his volume at May 1915 and only cover France.{{efn|Captain G. S. Gordon had been employed in January to cover events to December 1915 and to add the Dardanelles campaign but had disappeared to Gallipoli in June and written nothing.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=9}}}} Edmonds also came to doubt the quality of the work, judging Fortescue to be ignorant of the workings of a contemporary army, apparently being {{nowrap|200 years}} behind the times; Fortescue had excluded dates and times and used obsolete language. Fortescue agreed to revise his draft but then took no notice, his second draft being confused, containing nothing about the general situation and hardly referring to the Germans. Senior officers were ridiculed, the government blamed for not stopping the war and the French effort was "slurred over in less than one typewritten page". Edmonds blamed Fortescue for lacking interest, lethargy and ignoring the records made available, bungling the chance to write an exciting story of the BEF, by delivering a patchwork of unit diaries. At the end of the year, Edmonds decided to rewrite the work because of Fortescue's prevarication and "grossly inaccurate and misleading" writing; Fortescue was sacked and Edmonds even wanted him to be made to pay back his salary. After the unfortunate experience with Fortescue, Edmonds decided that an account must be enhanced by statements, private records of officers and by German material, to counter "garbled" accounts by the likes of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[John Buchan]]. Soundings with publishers and authors convinced Edmonds, that a work based on dispatches would fail to engage the public. An educational work needed a foundation on which to base teaching, conclusions which were similar to those of Hankey, that a work must be readable enough for the public to buy, be a credible educational work for the military student and rebut inaccurate commercial accounts by  civilian authors.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=9–11}}

==Prelude==

===Finance===
The cost of producing the official history was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 13 June 1922, during a proposal to farm out the work to private enterprise. Some [[Member of parliament|MPs]] claimed to have heard nothing of the ''History.... '' despite five volumes having been published to a very good press. Daniel was called before [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the [[Secretary of State for Education|President of the Board of Education]] and pointed out that working on the ''History....'' would never pay a living wage and that for educational reasons the government must foot the bill, because of the exceptional value of the work. He calculated that the cost of the ''History....'' from 1916 to 1922 was about £42,000, the military histories costing £16,800 and the naval works £11,800, while the annual cost of producing [[Hansard]] was £44,000. Daniel also showed that the cost of the war from 3 August 1914 to 31 March 1920 was £11,196,927,000 or £3,500 per minute, a vast cost against which, the price of making the experience available for education was about four minutes of war expenditure per year for the Historical Section. The next meeting of the Historical Section subcommittee on 31 July 1922 endorsed the continuation of the project.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=11–12}}

Finance remained the dominant influence on the production of the volumes, rather than literary or academic concerns about the work of the Historical Section. The subcommittee met six times in 1923 and on 9 August, Hankey managed to obtain a permanent Cabinet Subcommittee of Control of the Official Histories, chaired by the President of the Board of Education and meeting annually. There were twelve meetings between 1924 and 1946, with representatives from the Treasury, War Office, Admiralty, [[Air Ministry]] and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Daniel and Edmonds usually attended; other official historians and members of the [[Colonial Office|Colonial]] and [[India Office|India]] offices were present for particular discussions; where the committee failed to agree, a ruling was made by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. Edmonds submitted an annual report, other historians added summaries of their work, progress reports, staff and personnel matters and publications by foreign official historians. Meetings considered costs and the progress of publication, the number of volumes, their scope and size. On rare occasions the committee made a ruling on content, after complaints by a department; in 1928, the War Office strenuously objected to some of the content of the first Gallipoli volume by C. F. Aspinall-Oglander.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=12–13}}

Money determined the speed of publication, the size and number of volumes and the choice of author, Edmonds preferring to employ officers on half-pay or retired on £500 per year, about half the price of a civilian author; officers were usually willing to work longer hours and do unpaid work. The Treasury managed to obtain the removal of Lieutenant-General [[Launcelot Kiggell]], former Chief of the General Staff of the British Armies in France, late 1915 to early 1918, from 1918 Part I for reasons of cost. In 1923, it had been decided to prepare the volume out of sequence, because of the importance of the failure of the German [[Spring Offensive]] (21 March – 18 July) but by 1926, Kiggell had failed to prepare even a draft narrative for circulation to participants and thought that it would take him another four years. At the Committee for Control meeting in January 1926, the Treasury recommended Kiggell's removal and Edmonds agreed, because his work was "lacking in colour and atmosphere".{{sfn|Green|2003|p=14}}

===Commerce===
The price of the early volumes was set at 21 [[Shilling]]s (21s) and another 21s for accompanying map cases but this was considered too costly for professional officers. In 1923, the price was cut to 12s 6d but this left no surplus for advertising and no incentive for booksellers to display them prominently; publishers also set a maximum number of pages per volume, a constraint that led the Committee for Control in 1924 to advise a price increase to 15s. In March 1933, Edmonds showed copies of French, German and Austrian histories to demonstrate their "elaborate and voluminous" nature. The comprehensive nature of the project was also determined by finance and proposals made by government departments from 1922 to 1939, for histories beyond the Western Front. In 1931, the War Office asked for a volume on the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]], because of lessons offered by a campaign in such a climate, at such a distance from Britain. The Treasury refused and suggested that the Colonial Office pay, as it had done for the West African volume. East Africa Part I was eventually published in 1941 with Colonial Office money. At the same meeting, the Foreign Office asked for a volume on the [[Blockade of Germany]] at their expense, because of the lessons that could be learned and its utility in conferences on international law; by being labelled ''Confidential'' it could be written frankly.{{efn|The highest category of confidentiality was ''Secret'', which limited circulation of material to individuals and army officers who had a need to know. ''Confidential'' writing could be seen by commissioned officers and some [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) and ''For Official Use Only'' items could be seen but not bought, communicated to the press or persons not employed by the government.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}}} Several volumes were financed by interested departments but Edmonds retained supervision and maintained the same editorial control as for the other volumes.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=14–15}}

Parsimony affected the organisation of the Historical Section and the speed it could publish the ''History.... '' Premises, visits to battlefields and the number of historians and administrators were limited and in 1922, Edmonds threatened to resign if denied more help. Along with Daniel and Edmonds, the section had only three or four full-time officers, who had to write the volumes, prepare them for publication, maintain the library, study [[prisoner of war]] (POW) records and foreign official and non-official publications (in their native language) and provide help for the War Office, War Graves Commission, Staff College, educational establishments and government departments. The section had about {{nowrap|2,000 visitors}} a year to its cramped offices in [[Cavendish Square]], until it moved to the Audit Office in 1922. By 1924, Edmonds had five administrators and eight writers, when the French and German equivalents had about {{nowrap|130 each;}} the British staff were also underpaid, [[A. F. Becke]] being refused a salary increase from £500 per annum. Edmonds got the money instead, from £560 to £800 per annum and then £1,000 per annum in 1924, when he was writing most of the histories, managing the section and working a seven-day-week for three months, then taking ten days off (Edmonds worked like this for much of the {{nowrap|29 years}} of the project). A 1927 proposal for [[Cyril Falls]] (2 March 1888 – 23 April 1971) to visit Mesopotamia for £200 was vetoed by the Treasury but £50 was allowed for Aspinall-Oglander to visit Gallipoli.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=16}}

===Official documents===

The British had fielded the largest land army in their history, by 1924 the army had generated more than {{nowrap|25 million}} documents and Edmonds thought they would take nine years to sort. When he took up his duties, Edmonds found the papers in heaps in the floor and apparently summarily sacked the Chief Clerk, for refusing to climb a ladder to retrieve a bundle. Edmonds complained that his predecessor, C. T. Atkinson, had let historians plunder the packets of documents and not return items; it had taken until June 1923 to catalogue the records. The first draft of a volume was prepared by a "narrator", who sorted, read and analysed the documents. The result was revised by the "historian" who added comments and a conclusion. The draft was then sent to participants down to battalion commanders, other senior military officers, politicians and government departments. The draft for 1916 Part I (including the [[First Day on the Somme]]) was sent to {{nowrap|1,000 officers,}} who by 1931, had sent {{nowrap|1,470 replies.}} Comments on the first chapter created a pile {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and Edmonds complained that his staff was insufficient, considering that he had briefed them that all names, initials, ranks and numbers had to be checked and then cross-checked with the French and German accounts; the small number of staff slowed production. In 1922, Edmonds had calculated that it would take twenty years to write ten volumes, a feat that the French had achieved in three years. It took {{nowrap|21 years}} (excluding 1939–1945) to produce {{nowrap|14 Western}} Front volumes and {{nowrap|15 more}} on other theatres.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=16–18}}

===Content===
While finance determined the speed of the writing of volumes, Edmonds as Director had the greater influence on the literary and academic integrity of the work.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=18}} In the first volume published in 1922, Edmonds wrote in the preface, that "no deviation from the truth nor misrepresentation will be found in the official histories on which my name appeared". Edmonds' claim has been challenged ever since, leading to a common assumption that the work is vapid at best and at worst fraudulent, a partial, misleading and exculpatory account of the military establishment. In 1934, Liddell Hart questioned the integrity of the writers, calling 1918 Part I "patriotic" and "parochial". Norman Brook, one of the official historians, claimed in 1945, that Edmonds could not be trusted to revise 1916 Part I, because he had succumbed to the temptation to interpolate his views. In 1976, [[John Keegan]] (15 May 1934 – 2 August 2012) wrote

{{quote|...the compilers of the British Official History of the First World War have achieved the remarkable feat of writing an exhaustive account of one of the world's greatest tragedies without any display of emotion at all.|Keegan{{sfn|Green|2003|p=44}}}}

In 1985, David French wrote that Edmonds "...has a private purpose to conceal the truth about the high command in France from the lay public...." and that Edmonds had become concerned to refute claims by politicians, that Haig wasted lives on futile offensives; Edmonds' subjects were heroes beyond criticism. Tim Travers wrote that Edmonds eschewed direct criticism of senior officers, was obliged to Haig and protected his reputation, rigged facts and drew false conclusions in the volumes on the Somme (1916 Part I), Passchendaele (1917 Part II) and 1918 Part I.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=44–45}} In 1996, [[Paddy Griffith]] (4 February 1947 – 25 June 2010), called it an "...encyclopaedic work, transparently individualistic in tone, lucidly organised, wide in scope and by far the best book on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].". Griffith called the quantity of writing on the Great War "prodigious" and that despite Edmonds being unstable, insecure and having never held a [[Field officer|field appointment]], he was conscientious, intelligent and rarely allowed his devious and opinionated nature to distort his work on the official history.{{sfn|Griffith|1996|pp=258–259}}

Edmonds determined the presentation of information, which imposed constraints on the authors. All but implied criticism was to be avoided and the author was to resist the temptation to be "wise after the event". Disclosure of facts about opponents was to be kept to small-type footnotes or notes at the end of chapters, because introducing facts not known at the time was hindsight, which was unfair and un-scholarly. A conclusion could be written for reflection and comment but not for fault- finding. For Edmonds, the constraints were necessary for the facts innocuously to be shown to the lay reader, yet be available to experts reading between the lines.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=54–55}} After Henry FitzMaurice Stacke, the first author of ''Military Operations: East Africa, Volume I'' died and Charles Hordern was appointed as replacement, Hordern wrote that Stacke had been frustrated by being obliged to

{{quote|...gloss over (to put it mildly) mistakes and shortcomings to so great an extent as in my opinion to nullify the value of the work as history. Like him I have sedulously tried to avoid wounding any susceptibilities. But I have not shrunk from criticisms where they seemed necessary for the purpose either of impartial record or military study.... I have striven to say only enough to enable an intelligent reader to form his own judgement.|Charles Hordern (1938){{sfn|Green|2003|p=54}}}}

The avoidance of hindsight was consistent with the education Edmonds received at the [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] on the teaching of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] (1 June 1780 – 16 November 1831), that the critic must only use the information available to a commander and his motives, rather than what the commander did not and could not know. Using knowledge after the event could show arrogance and a lack of critical judgement. In writing the first Gallipoli volume (1929), Cecil Aspinall-Oglander ignored the convention and on the draft copy, Edmonds called his account biased and lacking in the objective judgement necessary for an official historian. When Aspinall-Oglander refused to revise his text, Edmonds criticised him for

{{quote|...lacking critical judgement, of arrogant sarcasm and of producing a valueless work which he would one day come to regret.|Green{{sfn|Green|2003|p=55}}}}

a complaint which had been occasionally levelled at Edmonds by the War Office and several participants in the war. Despite the constraints that Edmonds imposed on the form of the official histories, Green called his accounts accurate and comprehensive. Edmonds's correspondence with [[B. H. Liddell Hart|Basil Liddell Hart]] shows that Hart valued the official history and offered constructive criticism. Green wrote that when David French called the work "official but not history", he had used Hart's words out of context, Liddell Hart meaning that by leaving potentially controversial details to be read between the lines, Edmonds created the risk that later historians might use the phrase "official but not history", to describe the volumes.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=55}}

==Publishing==

===''Persia, 1914–1919''===
[[File:Iran map.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Iran (Persia)}}]]
In October 1920, the [[Government of India]] provided money for a record of the Indian contribution to the world war and chose Brigadier-General F. J. Moberly (15 September 1867 – 6 April 1952) to write the official account of the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] (6 November 1914 – 14 November 1918). Moberly published it in four volumes from 1923–1927 and in 1926 the Government of India requested an additional volume on the [[Persian Campaign]] (December 1914 – 30 October 1918). The work was nearly finished by September 1927, when the Government of India had doubts about publication on political grounds, because it would be dangerous to disclose intrigues with Iranian governments and individuals. The most helpful Iranian factions would come badly out of a volume that denigrated their assistance and "...the less we bring Afghanistan into the narrative the better for us". Sir Denys Bray of the [[Indian Political Department|Foreign and Political Department]] (Army Headquarters, India) supported the "excellent written" history but wanted it lodged in the ''Confidential'' records. Stephen Gaslee of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] wrote to Daniel in October 1927, about his concern that the government of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) might publish information from the [[Russian Empire]] on Iran.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}

Gaslee felt that Soviet disclosures might put the British government at a disadvantage, if a censored version of British involvement in Iran had already been published; instead he preferred a comprehensive history kept ''Confidential''. General [[George Macaulay Kirkpatrick|G. M. Kirkpatrick]] (Chief of the General Staff [India] from 1916 to 1920), took the view that discussion of the [[Seistan Force|Seistan Strategy]] might upset Iranian sensibilities. Sir [[Percy Cox]] (20 November 1864 – 20 February 1937) who had been Chief Political Officer of [[Indian Army during World War I|Indian Expeditionary Force D]], told Moberly that it was a fine piece of work, free from bias. Moberly wrote to Cox that avoiding controversy would render the volume valueless, making it impossible to justify British involvement in Iran to the public. Moberly referred to sensitivity over the "corrupt and self-interested attitude" of most Iranian politicians during the war and British fears of unrest in Afghanistan. Cox agreed that a [[Expurgation|bowdlerised]] account would be worthless and that Moberly should write without fear or favour, if necessary securing a commercial publisher. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 9 March 1928, the volume was limited ''For Official Use Only'' and since this would increase the cost of the volume, [[Office of Public Sector Information|His Majesty's Stationery Office]] (HMSO) agreed to pay for it.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}

Moberly finished the work in May 1928, then in September, after the Foreign Office and the Government of India had approved the text, [[William Peel, 1st Earl Peel|Lord Peel]], [[Secretary of State for India]], insisted that the politics of the military operations be removed and the last three chapters re-written, because even in a volume restricted ''For Official Use Only'', the disclosure of secrets was most objectionable. Moberly wrote that if officers were to benefit from the experience of wartime events in Iran, the exceptional nature of political factors there and in neighbouring countries could not be ignored. Moberly wrote that he understood the need for care in writing the history and that the chapters had been vetted informally by the Foreign Office and approved by Cox, who as an expert in the field, was well qualified to balance secrecy with the needs of army students. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 26 March 1929, it was ruled that the volume would be marked ''Confidential'' in Britain and ''Secret'' in India. Edmonds had objected to the ''Confidential'' label, since it would be withheld from young officers but was over-ruled. A limited edition of {{nowrap|500 unexpurgated}} copies was printed by HMSO in late 1929, with {{nowrap|150 being}} marked ''Secret'' and sent to the Government of India. In March 1930, copies of the ''Confidential'' volume were supplied to the [[Imperial War Museum]] (IWM) library among others and in February 1933, HMSO destroyed the last {{nowrap|300 unbound}} copies; in 1987 the IWM published a [[facsimile]] copy of the volume at £24 net.{{sfn|Moberly|1987|nopp=y}}

===''Rhineland, 1918–1929''===

In 1930, Edmonds proposed a volume on the occupation in the [[Rhine Province]] by [[British Army of the Rhine|British Army on the Rhine]] (BAOR), to counter a recent German book but the Treasury refused to pay.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=15}} Edmonds hoped that the War Office would find the money, began to collect information from former commanders and staffs of the BAOR and ensured the storage of BAOR records. By 1939, poor offices, lack of promotions and government parsimony, led him to complain that the official history, a national memorial, was being neglected. When Daniel retired in late 1939, Edmonds took on the duties of Secretary as well as Director and on 15 November, the Historical Section was evacuated to [[Lytham St Annes|St. Anne's on Sea]], [[Lancashire]] and thence to the [[National Library of Wales]] at [[Aberystwyth]] in April 1942. In February, the Committee for the Control of Official Histories decided to let Edmonds write the volume. [[Rab Butler|R. A. Butler]], [[President of the Board of Education]], said that the volume would be useful as a historical background for the [[Armistice]] and disarmament terms to be imposed on Germany. In 1987, Bayliss wrote that utility was the main criterion but that it also kept Edmonds busy, having been passed over for the writing of the official histories of the [[Second World War]]. Edmonds was pleased because he saw it as the final volume of his Western Front campaign history.{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Edmonds felt qualified to write the volume, having visited the Rhineland during the occupation, having gained specialist knowledge of the law of military government working with Professor [[L. F. L. Oppenheim]] (30 March 1858 – 7 October 1919) in 1912 on ''The Laws and Usages of War'' and being on good terms with many of the senior officers involved. Edmonds was hampered by a 1942 air raid, that burnt many of the records stored at [[Walworth]] in London. At Aberystwyth, Edmonds was isolated from metropolitan libraries and short of researchers. Requests for help from the Director of the Imperial War Museum had little effect, since his books had been moved to Barnstaple in Devon and because coverage of the occupation and inter-war period was sparse, owing to the usual lack of money. Edmonds was still able to glean plenty of details and gossip from senior officers in the occupation. General [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|Charles Fergusson]] (17 January 1865 – 20 February 1951), a former military governor of [[Cologne]], said that he disliked Field Marshal [[Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet|William Robertson]] (29 January 1860 – 12 February 1933) and that the enmity had led him to resign, despite being on good terms with General [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Herbert Plumer]] (13 March 1857 – 16 July 1932).{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Major-General [[Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd]], Chief of Staff of the BAOR, criticised Robertson for being too fussy, Fergusson for pro-German sympathies and told Plumer that Fergusson was too much of a gentleman for the job. Plumer had asked if it were possible to be too much of a gentleman and Massingberd reminisced that he had said

{{quote|...yes you can when fighting against animals like the Boche and the Japs.... You have to fight him as if he was a man eating Tiger or hunting Bull Elephant".|Massingberd{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}}}

Due to the hostilities, Edmonds was unable to correspond and exchange material with German researchers and was allowed only a [[galley proof]] and one page proof. In October 1943, Edmonds complained that speed and economy mattered more than respect for military history. Edmonds hoped that the volume would have educational use, in the event that Britain would again occupy foreign lands and that

{{quote|...the quick change of the German attitude from one of humble subservience to pre-war arrogance, and the call for the strictest economy regardless of the military situation may be said to be the keynotes of the story of the occupation.|Edmonds{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}}}

Edmonds struggled to produce an impartial history of the occupation and draft copies sent to the War Office and Foreign Office, led Brigadier W. L. van Cutsen for the War Office to complain that the volume should have been more broadly written and that administrative and other details were overly detailed but he found the chapter on the operations of the British [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesia]] Force helpful. Far worse criticism came from the Foreign Office on 3 January 1944, the text being called often misleading and incomplete, without the inclusion of much controversial material. It was suggested that the value of the volume would be enhanced by the reduction of political references to mere facts and dates. Examples included a desire to describe the murder of [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (7 April 1882 – 30 June 1934) "in the [[Night of the Long Knives|purge]] of 30 June 1934" rather than "by Hitler" in Edmonds' draft. Unemployment pay should never be referred to as a "dole" as this implied that British men had enlisted in the pre-1914 army to avoid starvation and [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] (17 January 1863 – 26 March 1945) might resent being portrayed as "less well-disposed" to Germany, than [[Bonar Law]] (16 September 1858 – 30 October 1923). More examples were quoted and ended on Edmonds' description of the [[Locarno Treaties]] (5–16 October 1925) with "...it is most improper for an official historian to describe a treaty concluded by His Majesty's Government as 'verbiage'".{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Edmonds retorted that he would ignore the criticisms as they were "trifling or silly", except for a request to cut a comment that [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon|Viscount D'Abernon]], Ambassador to Germany (1920–1925) was pro-German. Edmonds pointed out that the views were his, not officially endorsed and that the official history should not be determined by the War Office, Admiralty or Foreign Office. The volume had been based on official documents and he stood by it. The source of the criticism was [[Charles Webster (historian)|Charles Webster]] (25 July 1886 – August 1961), who had written memoranda analysing the Armistice and military occupation, ready for the anticipated re-occupation of Germany. Edmonds was most critical of one of the documents and wrote to Webster defending Haig. Obstacles were placed between him and his detractors, with the intention of protecting his feelings, because the Foreign Office harboured another critic, [[Llewellyn Woodward]] (1890–1971), who called the book episodic, with slurred chronology and a narrative of the controversy over provisioning the occupied territories, that was misleading; criticism of civilian authorities lacked evidence and was "dogmatic and prejudiced". Woodward, less critical than Webster, asked him to spare Edmonds' feelings but Webster found the book lacking in analytical rigour, refused to devote more time to it and R. A. Butler, Chairman of the Committee on the Control of Official Histories, got the job of rejecting the book for publication. In July 1944, over Edmonds' objections, it was decided to print a hundred copies ''For Official Use Only'' but only after many Foreign Office demands had been conceded, including cuts to the preface.{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}

Work on the volume had begun in 1930, resumed in September 1942 and was completed in draft in July 1943. Ready to print in May 1944, the order came on 31 July for a limited edition by HMSO, because the small print run made it impossible for [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] to realise a profit. Edmonds later tried to have the small issue made public but in November 1947, HMSO was ordered to destroy the type of the book. (The volume remained unseen, until the Fifty-year Rule was amended to the [[Thirty-year rule]] in 1967, that allowed the public to view the surviving copies.) The failings of the volume raised questions as to the suitability of Edmonds continuing as Director of the Historical Section for the rest of the series but given that it was beyond his normal area of expertise, he was allowed to carry on and produced a short account of the Occupation of Constantinople, saw the remaining volumes on the Western Front through to publication and retired in July 1949, just before the publication of the final volume ''Military Operations: Italy, 1915–1919'' (1949), ended thirty years' work. Edmonds was somewhat chagrined when the War Office ordered 800 copies of ''Assize of Arms'' (1946) by Brigadier-General [[J. H. Morgan]] (20 March 1876 – 8 April 1955), that he called far more outspoken on the occupation.{{efn|Edmonds was also affronted at the publicity for ''The British War Economy'' (1949) by [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Hancock]] and [[Margaret Gowing|Gowing]], compared to the penny-pinching over the ''History of the Great War''.{{sfn|Edmonds|1987|nopp=y}}}}

===1917 Part II===

====Edmonds====

[[File:Third Ypres - Map Showing Progress in the Ypres Area..jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing advances on the Ypres front, 31 July –10 November 1917.}}]]
In the second volume of ''Military Operations France and Belgium, 1917'' (1917 Part II) Edmonds, wrote that Haig and General [[Hubert Gough]] (12 August 1870 – 18 March 1963) the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]] commander (30 October 1916 – 27 March 1918), were at cross purposes before and during the early part of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]] (31 July – 10 November 1917). Edmonds described meetings between Gough and his corps commanders on {{nowrap|6 and 16 June,}} at which deeper objectives than those of the ''GHQ 1917'' plan was decided and that an extra objective was added, to be attempted at the discretion of divisional commanders. This fourth objective (red line) was beyond the range of most of the Fifth Army field artillery, so all heavy artillery was to be on call to put a defensive barrage beyond advanced posts along it. An advance to the red line was to be attempted only against weak opposition.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=127–128}}

Brigadier-General [[John Humphrey Davidson|J. H. Davidson]], head of the Operations Branch at General Headquarters, questioned the Fifth Army plan in a memorandum of 26 June, recommending that the objectives be less ambitious and that the provision for an advance of {{convert|5000|yd|m}} to the red line be abandoned.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=128, 431–432, App XV}} A Fifth Army order of 27 June, summarised a meeting of Gough and the corps commanders the previous day and laid down the green line as the main objective, that required an advance of {{convert|1000|yd|m}} in the south, {{convert|3500|yd|m}} in the centre and {{convert|2500|yd|m}} in the north, at the junction with the French [[First Army (France)|First Army]] (General [[François Anthoine]]). Patrols were to be sent forward to probe the German defences and occupy vacant ground but it was more important to avoid a ragged front line.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=431–432}} In reply to Davidson, Gough wrote that the green line should be attempted and that opportunities to take ground up to the red line "without much opposition", should be taken.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=129, 440–442}}

On 28 June, Haig discussed the Davidson memo at a meeting with Gough and General Plumer (commander of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] on the right of the Fifth Army) and emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=129–130}} Edmonds wrote that the Fifth Army plan did not conform to Haig's requirement that the main battle would be fought for the plateau. Gough had spread the Fifth Army divisions evenly along the front, when he could have increased the size of [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Claud Jacob]]), opposite the plateau. In a footnote, Edmonds described Fifth Army intelligence summaries in July, that stressed the strength of the German defences on the plateau, that the Germans were building more defences there than on the rest of the front and that the assembly areas of the German ''[[Eingreif division]]s'' (specialist counter-attack divisions) were behind the plateau and the Broodseinde–Passchendaele ridge. The summaries predicted that the Germans would try to hold the plateau, even if driven back across the Steenbeek further north.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|p=130}}

&lt;!--I fear that it is OR from here--&gt;The description of the misunderstanding between Haig and Gough is contradicted by an account on the following pages, of a visit made on 27 June by Haig to the headquarters of II Corps. Jacob asked that his southern flank be extended to allow an attack on the Bassevillebeek Spur (Tower Hamlets) beyond the Bassevillebeek Stream, to deny the German army a jumping-off place, for counter-attacks against the right flank of the corps. Haig emphasised the importance of the capture of the plateau and arranged with the Fifth Army headquarters "at once", for II Corps to take command of the [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th Division]] (Major-General Major-General [[Louis Bols]]) to the south, that was the northernmost division of the Second Army. The Fifth Army–Second Army boundary was moved south on 4 July, to the {{nowrap|Klein Zillebeke–Zandvoorde}} road. In a footnote Edmonds described the transfer of the artillery of the [[23rd Division (United Kingdom)|23rd Division]] (Major-General [[James Melville Babington|J. M. Babington]]), the 24th Division artillery, thirteen medium {{nowrap|(60-pounder gun),}} {{nowrap|25 heavy}} ({{nowrap|fifteen 6-inch gun,}} {{nowrap|five 8-inch}} and {{nowrap|five 9.2-inch howitzer}} batteries from the Second Army to II Corps.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=131–132}}

Edmonds recorded {{nowrap|226 heavy}} and medium guns, {{nowrap|526 heavy}} and medium howitzers, {{nowrap|1,098 field guns}} and {{nowrap|324 field howitzers}}, a total of {{nowrap|2,174 artillery}} pieces in the Fifth Army or {{nowrap|2,299 pieces}} "on the Fifth Army front".{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=135–136}} In footnotes, Edmonds added that II Corps had an "extra division", three heavy counter-battery and three heavy bombardment double groups; (a single group had {{nowrap|4–6 siege,}} heavy or medium batteries) while each of the three British corps to the north had two heavy counter-battery double groups and three heavy bombardment single groups. The II Corps divisions had eight or nine field artillery brigades each, rather than the six in the divisions of the other corps.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=135–136}}{{efn|In ''The [[18th (Eastern) Division|18th Division]] in the Great War'' (1922), G.

The green line for II Corps varied, from a depth of {{convert|1000|yd|m}} on the southern flank at Klein Zillibeke, to {{convert|2500|yd|m}} on the northern flank, along the Ypres–Roulers railway; the green line from the southern flank of XIX Corps to the northern flank of XIV Corps required an advance of {{convert|3500|–|2500|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=153, 433–436, map 10}} An advance of {{convert|5000|yd|m}} to the red line was not fundamental to the plan and discretion to attempt it was left with the divisional commanders, based on the extent of local German resistance, which conformed to the manual SS 135.{{sfn|Corkerry|2001|pp=28–29}} Had the German defence collapsed and the red line been reached, the German {{lang|de|Flandern}} I, II and III lines would have been east of the new front line, except for {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} of {{lang|de|Flandern I}} south of Broodseinde.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=127, maps 10, 12, 15}}{{efn|In the [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)#Capture of Westhoek, 10 August|Capture of Westhoek]] (10 August), II Corps was required to reach the black line of 31 July, an advance of {{convert|400|–|900|yd|m}} and at the [[Battle of Langemarck (1917)|Battle of Langemarck]] (16–18 August), the Fifth Army was to advance {{convert|1500|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=180, 186, 190, App XVII, maps 17–19}}}}

====Travers====
In ''The Killing Ground....'' (1987), Tim Travers wrote that on the planning and conduct of the [[Battle of Pilckem Ridge]] (31 July – 2 August) and the Battle of  Langemarck described in 1917 Part II, the volume reflected three controversies.{{sfn|Travers|1987|pp=203–209}} Travers wrote that Gough believed that Haig had ordered him to plan a breakthrough offensive, particularly at the meeting on 28 June, yet a few days later, Haig changed his mind and wanted a step-by-step attack. Travers wrote that it was illogical to give the principal command of a bite and hold attack to a "thruster" like Gough, when Plumer had a reputation for thoroughness. Travers wrote that Haig wavered in his thinking about what he wanted but left Gough under the impression that he was to plan a breakthrough attack.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=205}}

Travers wrote that Haig had emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, particularly at the meeting of 28 June and that on 30 June, Haig wrote, "Capture the Passchendaele–Staden Ridge", on his copy of the Fifth Army plan. The importance of the Gheluvelt plateau is also found in GHQ orders of 5 July and Fifth Army orders on 8 July. Travers wrote that the Fifth Army failed to give adequate emphasis to this and that a structural obstacle constrained the army, since the southern edge of the Gheluvelt plateau was inside the Second Army boundary. Travers concluded that Haig and GHQ chose the time, place and strategy of the campaign and that Gough and the Fifth Army staff decided the tactics.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=206}} Travers called Wynne's first draft of 1917 Part II (1943) as "anti-Haig", the second draft (1944) as "anti-Gough" and the third draft (1945) as "anti-Haig and anti-Gough". Edmonds's fourth draft (published 1948) was "pro-Haig and anti-Gough" and Wynne declined to be named as an author. Travers wrote that Edmonds was willing to accept criticism and made amendments for interested parties, to whom drafts were circulated but became increasingly protective of Haig's reputation and noticeably autocratic towards the other historians.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=215}}

Travers described a leadership vacuum in the BEF caused by delegation, that was "scandalous" and that Edmonds failed to stress this. Gough had attempted a breakthrough offensive, conforming to the decisions laid down by Haig, was at fault for overlooking the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau and for ignoring a suggestion by the [[XIV Corps (United Kingdom)|XIV Corps]] commander (Lieutenant-General [[Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan|Rudolph Cavan]]), to add weight to the attack there.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=216}} Travers wrote that 1917 Part II omitted a request made by Gough in August for a conference, to discuss a remedy for the lack of weight being brought against the Gheluvelt plateau, a matter that Haig and the staff at GHQ should have settled long before the attack commenced, along with the awkward placement of the Second Army-Fifth Army boundary. In the published version of 1917 Part II, most of the blame for the decisions on the type of offensive, the width and direction of attacks and responsibility for planning was put on Gough and the Fifth Army staff, rather than on Haig and GHQ for selecting the Ypres Salient at all.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=217}}

====Green====
In 2003, Green described the writing of 1917 Part II by Wynne and the circulation of the first draft to participants. Gough found the first draft highly objectionable and since so many other participants in the battle had died, his views were given considerable attention by Edmonds, during Wynne's absence on war work in 1943. Gough held that the draft exaggerated his intention to break through the German defences at Ypres. Gough described the meeting of 28 June 1917 by Haig, Gough and Plumer, as evidence of Haig's understanding and acceptance of the Fifth Army plan. Gough noted that General Headquarters had caused a road to be built and kept clear for the use of cavalry and that Haig had rejected Rawlinson's and Plumer's plans as too limited. Gough stressed that his plan was not limited by specific objectives, which had hampered attacks at Loos and Gallipoli in 1915 and the Somme in 1916. Wynne had referred to the Davidson memo of 26 June but Gough pointed out that reserves were available close by, to exploit advantages that emerged, rather than the first attacking troops were to advance indefinitely.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=168–169}}

Green wrote that Edmonds told Wynne to include the points made by Gough but that Wynne objected, because Davidson had related how Haig revised his views after a 25 June meeting with the Cabinet in London and wrote "wear down the enemy but have an objective" on the Fifth Army plan. Wynne claimed that Gough had misunderstood Haig's intentions and that was the source of Gough's objections to the draft; Edmonds supported Wynne but later changed his mind.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=170}} Green wrote that Haig had intended Gough to conduct a breakthrough attempt and that Edmonds had included this in the draft, as well as describing the changes in Haig's outlook during 1917, as the prospect of significant French support varied. Gough had added the red line to meet Haig's requirements but overlooked the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, spreading his forces equally across the attack front. Green noted that Prior and Wilson had found this in their 1998 study and that in 2001 Simpson noted Prior and Wilson's emphasis on artillery and lack of analysis of infantry operations.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=113}} Green also wrote that Edmonds referred to the continuity of Haig's optimism about the possibility of a deep advance on 4 August, 21 September and in early October, long after the likelihood had ended.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=171–175}}

Edmonds changed the draft in Gough's favour, by showing that the weather in August was unusually wet, with extracts from a French study ''Le Climat de La France'' (Bigourdan) that contradicted the 1929 of Haig's Chief Intelligence Officer Brigadier-General [[John Charteris|J. Charteris]] (1915–1918).{{sfn|Edmonds|1948|pp=211–212}}{{sfn|Charteris|1929|pp=272–273}} Edmonds wrote that the worst of the weather was from {{nowrap|12 October − 10 November,}} yet vividly described the wet and muddy conditions in August and their morale-sapping effect on British troops.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=178}} Wynne had written extensively on the difficulties of the French Army after the Nivelle offensive and its effect on British strategy but Edmonds cut much of this.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=182}} Edmonds left much of the remainder of Wynne's draft, despite Gough's objection that it implied that Haig had abrogated his authority, by delegating so much to Gough and not imposing changes, to allay his doubts about the Fifth Army plan for the Gheluvelt plateau.{{sfn|Travers|1987|p=177}} Edmonds noted the persistence with which Haig pursued objectives and that he advocated attacks regardless of their geographical progress, to keep pressure on the German army.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=182}}

Green related an estrangement between Wynne and Edmonds, over Edmonds' willingness to accept Gough's objections. Edmonds sent Wynne to meet Gough, which led to a substantial change in Wynne's point of view. Wynne revised the draft to remove much of the blame from Gough, writing that Haig bore principal responsibility for the Fifth Army plan in the third (1945) draft. Edmonds then found this draft objectionable and quarrelled with Wynne, who declined to be named as an author. Green wrote that Edmonds and Wynne had changed their views about Gough and made the narrative of his role in the events of 1917 much more accurate, it being noticeably less defensive of Haig. Wynne's conclusion had been that the strategy of retaining the initiative to protect the French Army had worked and that the tactical intention to clear the Belgian coast had failed, due to an underestimation of German resilience and the mistaken attempt at a breakthrough.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=183–186}}

Earlier plans had been for short steps and an emphasis on the Gheluvelt plateau. Haig was responsible for accepting Gough's plan for 31 July, despite his cautious reminder to Gough on 6 July, giving the Passchendaele–Staden Ridge and the Belgian coast as geographical objectives. Wynne removed these details from his draft but concluded that the ''GHQ 1917'' plan might have been as successful as the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]] (7–14 June). Edmonds had also accepted the logic of an offensive in Flanders but not that of appointing Gough; if Haig had wanted a cautious attack he was wrong to have superseded Plumer. Green showed that Edmonds acknowledged the constraints affecting Haig but that he had wanted a breakthrough attack, chose Gough who known as a "thruster" and encouraged his optimism; Haig had kept any misgivings to himself.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=183–186}}

Green referred to Travers and wrote that he had taken the same view as Edmonds, on the questions of the intended breakthrough and the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds had written that Haig had accepted Gough's wishes and Green wrote that this did not mean that Gough was aware of Haig's doubts. Edmonds thought that Haig wanted a decisive success and the capture of distant objectives on the first day, ''despite'' doubts that he withheld. Travers had written that the Edmonds draft was wrong, yet had formed the same conclusions as Edmonds. Travers had criticised the published draft, for failing to record that Haig had not resolved disagreements and problems among his subordinates, long before the offensive began; Green wrote that Edmonds had made the same criticism. Green wrote that judging the drafts of the volume "pro-" or "anti-" Haig or Gough was facile and led to inconsistent conclusions. If the published draft was "anti-" Gough that it was surprising that he had called it a great improvement.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=186–188}}

Green compared the volume with later studies and wrote that the narrative did not support an explanation of the delay from {{nowrap|7 June – 31 July,}} being caused by a need to divert the Germans from the French army. On 7 May, Haig had decided to begin the Messines operation in early June but he had not been informed until 2 June of the state of the French army. Edmonds had written that the attack on Messines Ridge began on 7 June, because of the difficulty of mounting three simultaneous attacks at Ypres. Edmonds ascribed the apparent delay from {{nowrap|7 June – 31 July,}} to Haig's decision to give principal responsibility to Gough.{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=188–189}} Wynne had claimed that Edmonds failed to reveal the superiority of German tactics but in 1998, Prior and Wilson had shown that British tactics had evolved in 1917, although their application was inconsistent. Edmonds had demonstrated that the attack on Messines ridge was a cautious advance for {{convert|1|–|2|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The plan incorporated progressive elements like those used at Arras on 9 April, particularly emphases on counter-battery fire and a carefully controlled creeping barrage.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=190}}

The Second Army had {{nowrap|2,266 guns}} and howitzers, that fired {{convert|144000|LT|t}} of ammunition, {{frac|2|1|2}} times more than that available for the First Day on the Somme (1 July 1916), to counter the deep German defence zones and ''Eingreif'' divisions.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=190}} Strongpoints were destroyed, wire was cut and German artillery suppressed. Three layers of creeping barrage {{convert|700|yd|m}} deep preceded the infantry, who had been trained in the pillbox fighting methods used at Vimy Ridge. The infantry were followed by mopping-up parties, who captured by-passed German positions. Use of such techniques had been possible, because the artillery had become more accurate. The gunners also had more ammunition to use and had been able to suppress German defences as the British advanced; objectives had been limited to the range of the artillery and had led to a great victory. Prior and Wilson wrote that these methods were not used on 31 July, because Haig had over-ruled Rawlinson, Plumer and Davidson; Gough over-reached and left the British infantry vulnerable to German counter-attacks. Edmonds had written that on 31 July, excessive demands had been placed on the artillery, that had spread its fire too thin.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=190}}

Green wrote that at the end of August, Haig had turned to Plumer and bite-and-hold methods, that Edmonds called this a radical revision. The greatest weight of artillery-fire possible was to be massed against the Gheluvelt plateau, for a succession of strictly limited attacks. Plumer planned four steps at six-day intervals, to give time to move artillery and supplies forward. The steps were limited to a depth of {{convert|1500|yd|m}} and a large increase in medium and heavy artillery was to be used to smash pillboxes and to add to the counter-battery effort. The [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]] (20–26 September) had double the number of guns on half the depth of attack, making four times the weight of shell compared to 31 July. Infantry tactics also emphasised systematic consolidation of all captured ground and strongpoints. With the new battle drill and unprecedented artillery support, the attack was a great success. Green noted that Prior and Wilson described Menin road as a triumph of reduced expectations and that Passchendaele Ridge was still {{convert|4500|yd|m}} away. Haig had then insisted on preparations for a breakthrough after the successes of the [[Battle of Polygon Wood]] (26–27 September) and the [[Battle of Broodseinde]] (4 October) but inadequate artillery preparation led to the failures at the [[Battle of Poelcappelle]] (9 October) and the [[First Battle of Passchendaele]] (12 October).{{sfn|Green|2003|pp=191–193}}

Green concluded that the publication of 1917 Part II in 1948 had much to awaken controversy, particularly the contrast between flawed tactics and the methods used with success earlier in 1917. Green wrote that the volume mostly accorded with modern writing and contained little bias regarding Haig. Edmonds had referred to the external constraints of lack of manpower and the state of the French Army, yet his narrative had made the military errors manifest; Haig's desire for a breakthrough had led to a failure to relate strategy to tactics. Haig had failed to communicate with Plumer and Gough and had prolonged the offensive beyond the period of good weather that ended in early October. Green concluded that Edmonds had produced a work of lasting authority, in a series of substantial historical, military and literary value. Green wrote that later scholars who have accused Edmonds of bias, have had to acknowledge that his assessments and conclusions are largely accurate.{{sfn|Green|2003|p=207}}

The '''Institute of Political History''' ({{lang-hu|Politikatörténeti Intézet}}, PTI) is a company located in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], outside the Hungarian governmental institute-system and a public utility private research place. It is aiming and organizing the multifold scientific research of the recent past and the present age. Besides history it is widening its focus on other social sciences as well. It helps the birth of new scientific results with tenders, scholarships, support of individual and team researches. It enables the public usage of the documents of national value kept in the Archives and Library of the Institute. Besides the historical and societal research works, it hosts scientific conferences and cultural events as well. It is a kind of intellectual center that is concentrating first of all on renewing and popularizing social criticism in the widest range of the term.  For the publication of the results of the researches the Foundation operates a detached publishing house, ''Napvilág Kiadó'', and publishes the historical quarterly ''Múltunk'' (Our Past).

==The Archives of Political History and of Trade Unions==

The precursor of the Archives was established in 1948. It served as a department of the Institute of Labour Movement of the Hungarian Workers' Party until 1955, of the Institute of Party History of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party]] from 1957, of the Institute of Political History of the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] between 1989 and 1998, and as a part of the non-profit organization of the Institute of Political History from 1998. Its maintainer is the Foundation of Political History. Before the year 1989, the Archives had been collecting primarily the documents of the pre-1945 legal and illegal movements of the Hungarian labour movement, of the parties of the popular democratic period following the [[First World War]], of the left-wing youth organizations, and of the people connected to these movements and organizations. Now it is storing the documents of the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]] and the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party as well until 1992. Since 1998 it has been storing the documents of the Hungarian trade-unionist movement that were produced during the period of 1945 to 1989 and which had previously been stored in the [[Central Archives of Trade Unions]]. Nowadays the Archives are focusing not merely on the political Left, but also on the entire Hungarian history of the [[modern age]]. It is endeavoring to trace, collect and preserve the private documentations that are enduring sources of contemporary history, with a special emphasis on the history of the [[change of regime]], 1989.
As open proprietary archive, it is handling the documents in its care in accordance with the Hungarian rules set forth for public archives. According to its own rules, the Archives are open for research, while the staff is ready to provide the necessary information and supplies data as well.
In the care of the Archives there are 4298 running-metres of documents, and also 1215 cassettes and tapes, 30 discs and 284 rolls of research films. The majority of the fonds are co-ordinated and included in the inventory.

==Recent attacks against the PTI by the Hungarian government ==

The Hungarian right-wing government of [[FIDESZ]]-[[KDNP]] alliance with the assistance of the extreme right-neofascist opposition party [[Jobbik]] is attempting to confiscate both the majority of the materials of the Archives and the headquarters building &lt;ref&gt;[http://hvg.hu/itthon/20120404_kuria_politikaitorteneti_intezet Kell a hely a Kúriának, átköltöztetnék a Politikatörténeti Intézetet] – hvg.hu; 14. 04. 2012 (Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Institute of Political History, since it is the last independent historical workshop in Hungary;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polhist.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=289&amp;Itemid=124 Petition to stop government offensive against the Institute of Political History in Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt; with its two-third majority in Parliament the government even changed the Hungarian [[Constitution]] to make its attacks against the Institute legal.

[[Image:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''legacy of the Great Famine''' in [[Ireland]] ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') followed a catastrophic period of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The famine was a watershed in the [[history of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting [[Irish diaspora|diaspora]], the famine entered [[folk memory]]&lt;ref&gt;The Famine that affected Ireland from 1845 to 1852 has become an integral part of folk legend. Kenealy, ''This Great Calamity'', p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a rallying point for various [[Irish nationalism|nationalist movements]]. Modern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish [[historical narrative]], referring to the preceding period of Irish history as "pre-Famine."

==Political and Cultural Impact of the Famine==

===In Ireland===
Political reaction resulting from the [[Great Irish Famine]] was muted, because of the extremely limited [[electoral franchise]] that existed at the time. While [[Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Irish politics]] in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the [[Catholic Emancipation]] and "Repeal" movements under [[Daniel O'Connell]], it was not until the 1880s under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], nearly forty years after the Famine, that a major [[Irish nationalist]] political movement, the [[Home Rule League]] (later known as the 'Parliamentary Party') appeared. Parnell was also instrumental in establishing the [[Irish Land League]], to achieve [[land reform]]. (The [[Independent Irish Party]], formed in June 1852, disintegrated within four years, but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices.)

Outside the mainstream, too, reaction was slow. The 1848 [[Young Ireland]] rebellion under [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]], though occurring at the start of the Famine, was hardly impacted upon ''by'' the Famine, as much as by the clash between the "constitutional" nationalism and [[Catholicism]] of O'Connell and the [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[Irish republicanism|republicanism]] of Davis. Another rebellion would not occur again until the 1860s under the [[Fenians]]/[[Irish Republican Brotherhood]]. Historians have speculated that, such was the economic and social impact on Ireland, the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards; in other words, that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s.

Though its electorate was a small part of the population (as elsewhere in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]), those Irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1880s to vote for the two major British political parties, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], with more votes and seats going to the latter, even though it had been the party of government during the Famine. Because of the skewed franchise, a large body of voters continued to vote for [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]], who wished to maintain the Union that joined Britain and Ireland.

The British Royal Family avoided some censure, due to their perceived impotence in political affairs. Although some believed the myth that [[Queen Victoria]] (known in Ireland in later decades as the "Famine Queen") had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief, in fact the sum was £2,000, the equivalent of £61,000 today, from her personal resources. She also was patron of a charity that fundraised. On instruction of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] Victoria made what was largely seen as a propaganda visit in 1849. However, this visit was conducted under stringent security measures and was not free from protests or controversy. The celebrations associated with her visit  just after the famine were compared to "illuminating a graveyard" in a newspaper editorial at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy, Christine (2000), Hidden Famine: Hunger, Poverty and [[Sectarianism]] in [[Belfast]], p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic consequences===

It is estimated that one and a half million people died during the Famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851. A large proportion of these were Irish speakers, and the poorest districts, from which emigration continued to flow, were generally Irish-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maureen Wall]], 'The Decline of the Irish Language,' p.87, in Ó Cuív, Brian (ed.) (1969), ''A View of the Irish Language'', Irish Stationery Office.&lt;/ref&gt; The Famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language (the general exclusion of Irish from public life and the influence of the English-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part) but it was a conspicuous element.&lt;ref&gt;Breandán Ó Madagáin (1974, 1980), ''An Ghaeilge in Luimneach 1700–1900'', pp. 14–22, An Clóchomhar Tta, {{ISBN|0-7171-0685-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of an Ireland which thought of itself as essentially English-speaking, though with a persistent and influential reaction in the form of organisations such as the [[Gaelic League]] and the growth of a network of urban [[Status of the Irish language|Irish-speaking activists]] from the late nineteenth century on.

In pre-Famine Ireland Irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition. The latter persisted in the form of [[Irish language]] manuscripts containing both prose and poetry: a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Tomás de Bhaldraithe (ed.) (1970, 1973, 1976), ''Cín Lae Amhlaoibh'', p. xxvii, An Clóchomhar Tta, {{ISBN|0-7171-0512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ó Madagáin, pp. 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Many such manuscripts were taken to America by emigrants in the 1840s and after.

The emigration of numerous Irish speakers to America as an immediate or long-term result of the Famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the Irish language. This was marked in part by the foundation of Philo-Celtic Societies and the founding of the monthly journal ''An Gaodhal'' in 1881, the first such publication anywhere in which Irish was extensively used.&lt;ref&gt;Breandán Ó Buachalla, ' ''An Gaodhal'' i Meiriceá,' pp. 38–56, in Stiofán Ó hAnnracháin (ed.) (1979), ''Go Meiriceá Siar'', An Clóchomhar Tta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.H.A. Williams, 'Ceol na hÉireann agus amhráin na ndaoine sna Stáit Aontaithe,' pp. 68–84, in Ó hAnnracháin (ed.) (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish emigrants abroad===

If the political elite in Ireland remained tolerant of British political parties and the monarchy, emigrants were not so. Many Irish emigrants to the United States quickly associated with separatist republican groups and organisations like the IRB. The political liberties and freedom of opportunity they encountered in the States confirmed for them the potential of an independent Ireland and often made them more passionate and optimistic than some of their brethren at home.

The Famine and its causes became a major platform for emigrant anger, as it was the main cause for most of them being emigrants in the first place. [[John Mitchel]], a journalist by trade (who had written for Thomas Davis's newspaper, [[The Nation - Irish newspaper|''The Nation'']] before leaving to set up his own paper, only to be arrested, tried for [[sedition]] and [[Penal transportation|transported]] to the [[penal colony]] of [[Van Diemen's Land]]) proved to be a superb campaigner against British rule in Ireland. Analysing the famine, he wrote:

{{cquote|The Almighty indeed sent the potato blight but the English created the famine... a million and half men, women and children were carefully, prudently and peacefully slain by the English government. They died of hunger in the midst of abundance which their own hands created.&lt;ref&gt;John Mitchel, ''The Last Conquest of Ireland''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;John Mitchel&lt;/small&gt;}}

Mitchel's commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants, who saw themselves as the dispossessed, forced from Ireland by a famine they blamed on British government policies. The famine became a constant issue with [[Irish American]]s, who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the United States, remained emotionally attached to their native land. Leaders such as [[John Devoy]] in later decades came to play a major role in supporting Irish independence. It was no accident that the [[President of Dáil Éireann]], [[Éamon de Valera]] in 1920 chose to travel to the United States, not elsewhere, in his efforts to get the [[Irish Republic]] recognised and accepted, or that when [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] launched special bonds to fund the new Republic, many were sold to Irish Americans.

==Suggestions of genocide==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
A claim was made by a US professor of law, [[Francis A. Boyle]] that the Famine was [[genocide]] by the British against the Irish, meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination.  One US historian, [[James Mullin (American law librarian)|James Mullin]], insists that what happened can be described as genocide, sometimes accusing other historians, statisticians and researchers who state otherwise of pushing a British point of view, or of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]], rewriting history to make excuses for [[British imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/68067 Americanchronicle.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However more US, British and Irish historians, such as Professors [[F.S.L. Lyons]], [[John A. Murphy]], [[R. F. Foster (historian)|Roy Foster]], and [[James S. Donnelly, Jr]], as well as historians [[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], [[Peter Gray (historian)|Peter Gray]], [[Ruth Dudley Edwards]] and [[Cormac Ó Gráda]] have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide. All historians generally agree that British policies during the Famine (particularly those applied by the ministry of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]) were misguided, ill-informed and counter-productive, and that had a similar crisis occurred in England instead of Ireland then the government's response would have been very different.

The famine killed one million Irish through hunger and related diseases such as [[cholera]]. A million others emigrated during the famine, with millions more following them in the following decades. The vast majority of these people were [[Roman Catholic]], traditionally less inclined towards loyalty to the Crown. However, while it could easily be said that the famine and its after-effects ended conclusively any chance of Ireland ever being a military or economic threat to Britain again, it should be also noted that the famine's long term demographic effects were less the result of deaths from starvation (which, as with most famines, affected the old, the very young and the sick disproportionately) and more the result of emigration (which primarily affected the young population of reproductive age).

The historical evidence suggests that earlier Irish famines caused mortality of comparable magnitude to the famine of the 1840s. Some famines, in particular the [[Irish Famine (1740–41)|that of the early 1740s]], might have even killed a larger proportion of the Irish population compared to that of the mid-19th century. Nevertheless, after earlier famines the population recovered relatively quickly if only because most of the survivors did not have the resources to emigrate. By comparison, during the first half of the nineteenth century the real cost of a transatlantic voyage would fall to a point that by the 1840s even the poorest people could secure passage, albeit under wretched conditions. It seems virtually certain that economic factors alone would have caused considerable emigration from Ireland even without mass starvation. A comparison between the historical populations of [[Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Demographic history of Scotland|Scotland]] proves useful with regards to this point - even though Scotland has not experienced a catastrophic famine in the past two centuries, nevertheless, it has experienced steady emigration over that time, albeit on a slower and steadier pace compared to Ireland. As a result, while the population of Scotland surpassed that of Ireland around the beginning of the 20th century, by the end of the century the population of Ireland once again exceeded that of Scotland.

==Legacy of the Famine today==

Ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in the 1990s. It was a contrast, in many ways, with the 100th anniversary in the 1940s. Then, only a few commemorations were held—the most significant of which was a commissioned volume of Famine history edited by [[R. Dudley Edwards]] and [[T. Desmond Williams]] (though not published until 1956), and the 'Famine Survey' undertaken by the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] in 1945. The 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the Famine, as hundreds of events took place in Ireland and throughout the Irish diaspora, some of which received sponsorship from the [[National Famine Commemoration Committee]] based in the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], led by [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Avril Doyle]]. At the Great Famine Event held in [[Millstreet]], a statement from [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] was read aloud, apologising for the failure of past British governments to adequately address the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] ''Blair says sorry for Britain's 'failure' in the Irish famine'' 2 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A large amount of new famine studies were produced, many detailing for the first time local experiences. Historians re-examined all aspects of the Famine experience; from practical issues like the number of deaths and emigrants, to the long-term impact it had on society, sexual behaviour, land holdings, [[property rights]] and the entire Irish identity. In 2010 Britain failed to send a diplomatic representative to the opening of the National Famine Commemoration, while 14 other nations did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/british-fail-to-attend-famine-ceremony-2182551.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Famine in song==
The Famine is also commemorated in song, both from the period and from modern times. Irish novelist and songwriter, [[Brendan Graham]] has written a number of novels and songs on '''An Gorta Mor – the Great Irish Famine'''. His book publishing deal with [[Harper Collins]] originated from a number of songs he had written about An Gorta Mor, resulting in the publication of his best selling 'documentary novel' of the Famine – '''The Whitest Flower''' (HarperCollins, London, Sydney, Toronto, 1998). The Sunday Times, Canberra called The Whitest Flower – 'An important addition to the Irish national story'. The Whitest Flower, with its song 'soundtrack', was a required text for Boston's MIT Women's Studies Course. Along with its sequel '''The Element of Fire''' (HarperCollins, 2001), The Whitest Flower was also listed as 'support fiction' for Ireland's Leaving Certificate, History syllabus.

"'''[[The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)|The Voice]]'''" written by [[Brendan Graham]] and performed by Eimear Quinn won the 1996 [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Ireland. The lyrics refer to Ireland's troubled history and point clearly to Famine times in Ireland, ''I am The Voice of your hunger and pain''.

As well as entering the British Pop Charts, The Voice was one of the songs studied for the UK GCSE Music Syllabus, 1998. Eimear Quinn's version featured in the [[Pierce Brosnan]] movie – The Nephew, while the song found a new life in America with the recording and widespread PBS broadcasting of it as part of the group Celtic Woman's rise to prominence there.  Author and sociologist E. Moore Quinn in her book 'Irish American Folklore in New England', published in 2009, quotes the full lyric of The Voice.

'''"The Fairhaired Boy"''' – This song written by [[Brendan Graham]] was recorded by Cathy Jordan and [[Dervish]] on their 2003 album, 'Spirit'. Carmel Conway also recorded the song on her 2009 album 'This Beautiful Day'. It is also performed in the 'Cois Tine – Stories of Liam O' Flaherty' – by singer and violinist Fionnuala Howard. A song of emigration from Ireland during Famine times, The Fairhaired Boy tells of the sorrow of parting – 'Soon you'll in California be or Colorado bound'. In The Whitest Flower, Graham's heroine Ellen sings the song to Roberteen, a young neighbour from Ireland whom she finds dying in the lazaretto (fever shed) at Canada's Quarantine Island of Grosse Ile. The song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses, the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener's interest alive.

'''"Crucán na bPáiste"''' – 'the burial place of (unbaptised) children' – lies on a hilltop in Maamtrasna, Co.Mayo, overlooking Lough Nafooey, and Lough Mask in Ireland. It is a lament by a mother for a child she buries there during Aimsir an Drochshaoil ('The Time of the Bad Life' – the Famine). The song was written by Graham for Ellen Rua, one of the characters in his second novel,  '''The Brightest Day, The Darkest Night''', also published by Harper Collins. It has been recorded and performed by a number of artistes most notably [[Karen Matheson]] (as part of the Transatlantic Sessions), Cathy Jordan of Dervish and Eimear Quinn. Graham reveals the story of how the song came to be written in his Sunday Miscellany radio piece for RTÉ, called ''Effin' Songs'', recorded live in Ireland's National Concert Hall, with Eimear Quinn and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and piper Neil Martin, following with the song itself.

''"Crucán na bPáiste had become a claw in my gut – and my pilgrimage. Over many months it inched out in me its cry...focal by focal...line by line...until I was set free and it had found its epiphany. I had learned to keep out of the way...let the song write itself. This, I suppose is the real answer to the question with which we started. The truly special songs write us...we don't write them; we don't find them...they find us"''.

Another of Graham's Famine songs, '''"Ochón an Gorta Mor / Lament of the Great Hunger"''', was commissioned by the Irish Government, as part of the Ceól Reoite (Frozen Music – after Goethe's 'Architecture is frozen music') Millennial Project. Fourteen Irish composers were asked to pick a monument of national significance and to write a piece of music/song which would release from it the music frozen within. Graham chose the Curvilinear Glasshouses at Dublin's National Botanic Gardens, constructed at the time of An Gorta Mor, by monies diverted from research to find a cure for the potato blight afflicting Ireland. The glasshouses looked down over the Gardens' 'vegetable patch', where the blight was first discovered in Ireland in August 1845. Graham has described the 'frozen music' locked within the architecture of the Curvilinear Glasshouses as 'a lament for a famished people'. A song for unaccompanied voice it has been recorded by Róisín Elsafty, on the Ceól Reoite album and as a 'hidden track' by Cathy Jordan on the Dervish album, Spirit  . The song was also performed by Nuala Ní Chanainn in the 2002 production of Aistir/Voyage by the Swiss- based, Cathy Sharp Dance Ensemble.

"'''[[You Raise Me Up]]'''" - It was in fact reading Graham's novel The Whitest Flower, that led Norwegian composer, [[Rolf Løvland|Rolf Lovland]] to contact Graham with a melody. This melody in turn inspired Graham to write the lyric -You Raise Me Up, which has been recorded by some 400 artists (including [[Westlife]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Brian Kennedy (singer)|Brian Kennedy]] and [[Secret Garden (duo)|Secret Garden]], [[Daniel O'Donnell]], [[Helene Fischer]], [[Il Divo]], [[Russell Watson]] and [[Paul Potts]]) and has become one of the most successful songs in popular music history.

[[Brendan Graham]] has also recently written a number of integrated song and narrative pieces including '''Writing the Famine in Fiction and Song''', for The National Famine Commemoration Week in Ireland, 2010. This was narrated by the author with songs performed by Cathy Jordan accompanied on piano by Feargal Murray.

In Quebec, 2011, his shorter narrative and song piece – '''From Famine to Freedom – Ireland to Grosse Ile''' – was performed by the [[Quebec Symphony Orchestra]] and soloist Méav Ní Mhaolchatha, with Graham's narration translated into French. It included a first performance with orchestra of The Whitest Flower, Graham's title song for the soundtrack to his book. In response to the view handed down at the time of Ireland's Famine that "The judgement of God…sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated" (Charles E. Trevelyan – Permanent Assistant Secretary at the British Treasury with prime responsibility for Famine relief in Ireland), Graham's song calls to task a vengeful God:-

In August 2012 Brendan Graham composed and presented '''From Famine to Freedom—Ireland to Australia''', a commemoration in word and song of those who suffered during An Gorta Mór–The Great Irish Famine–and of those who fled the Famine to establish a new life Australia. Graham wrote a new song called, '''"Orphan Girl"''', dedicated to the memory of the 4,112, mainly teenage Irish orphan girls, who were given a free passage to Australia from Workhouses in every county of Ireland between 1848 and 1850. Brendan Graham was joined by Australian singer-songwriter, '''[[Sarah Calderwood]]''' who unites classic with contemporary folk. She is the charismatic front woman of Australia's premier Celtic group, '''Sunas''', who released the ABC best-selling debut album ‘As Night Falls’. Graham and Calderwood were also joined on the day by the inspirational '''Australian Girls Choir''', who have previously performed for Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama. The commemoration in words and song was a community day of celebration and remembering, especially for those who are descendants of these Irish Workhouse young women.For more information see www.irishfaminememorial.org

More recently in March 2013 '''The Possible Dreams Choir''' toured Victoria in Australia, singing '''"Orphan Girl"''' (sung by Fortunate and Nomcebo) and '''"You Raise Me Up"''' as part of their '''Voices for the Voiceless''' tour. Possible Dreams International, Inc is a non-profit organisation which partners with rural and remote communities in Swaziland, Southern Africa to empower families and individuals living with extreme poverty, malnutrition and endemic disease. So in Graham's "Famine in Song" lyrics, there resonates a global reach.

A famous modern song on the famine is "[[The Fields of Athenry]]", by [[Pete St. John]]. Written in three verses, it deals with a fictitious but realistic story of "Michael" being deported to [[Botany Bay]] for stealing corn to feed his starving family. Performed in folk, traditional and even reggae versions, it is often sung by supporters of [[Glasgow]]'s [[Celtic F.C.]], many of whom are of Irish descent. The song itself sums up the sense of despair, anger and bitterness of famine victims. The song was also covered by [[Boston]] [[punk rock]] band, the [[Dropkick Murphys]] on their 2003 ''[[Blackout (Dropkick Murphys album)|Blackout]]'' album.
[[File:Famine memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rowan Gillespie]]'s "Famine", in Ireland Park, [[Toronto]] [[Harbourfront (Toronto)|Harbourfront]]]]

[[Luka Bloom]]'s song 'Forgiveness' from his album Salty Heaven is sung from the point of view of an Irish Famine refugee who has relocated to Canada and who despite his suffering has chosen forgiveness over bitterness.

Luka Bloom's brother [[Christy Moore]] also has a song, written by Bloom but recorded by Moore, called 'The City of Chicago,' that chronicles the effects of the Famine and the subsequent mass emigration.

[[Pagan metal]] band [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] also have a song about the Famine named "The Coffin Ships" on their 2005 album ''[[The Gathering Wilderness]]''.

Another related song is "Famine" by [[Sinéad O'Connor]], released on the [[Universal Mother]] album. The lyrics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhb.fr/langues/Cei/soconnor.htm UHB.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003814/http://www.uhb.fr/langues/cei/soconnor.htm |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise the political aspect of the famine.

==Ireland and modern famine relief==

Ireland has been at the forefront of international famine relief.  In 1985 [[Bob Geldof]], Irish rock star and founder of [[Live Aid]], revealed that the people of Ireland had given more to his fundraising efforts per head of population than any other nation in the world. Irish NGOs ''[[Goal (charity)|Goal]]'', ''[[Concern (charity)|Concern]]'', ''[[Trócaire]]'' and ''[[Gorta]]'' play a central role in helping famine victims throughout Africa. In 2000, [[Bono]], lead singer with Irish band [[U2]], played a central role in campaigning for [[debt relief]] for African nations in the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign. The Irish famine experience continues to influence many Irish people in their attitudes towards the [[developing world]] and famine victims everywhere.

[[Nuclear weapons testing]] is defined in treaty language by specifying a space and time requirement.

{{quote|In conformity with treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union, a salvo is defined, for multiple explosions for peaceful purposes, as two or more separate explosions where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points, and the total length does not exceed 40 kilometers. For nuclear weapon tests, a salvo is defined as two or more underground nuclear explosions conducted at a test site within an area delineated by a circle having a diameter of two kilometers and conducted within a total period of time of 0.1 second.&lt;ref name=Yang&gt;{{citation|last1=Yang|first1=Xiaoping|first2=Robert|last2=North|first3=Carl|last3=Romney|first4=Paul G.|last4=Richards|date=August 2000|title=Worldwide Nuclear Explosions|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/my_papers/WW_nuclear_tests_IASPEI_HB.pdf|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition is inclusive of "zero yield" [[Nuclear weapons design#Warhead design safety|safety tests]] of warheads, whether the test is successful (there is no nuclear yield) or the test is unsuccessful (there is a nuclear yield).
It does not include [[Nuclear weapons testing#Alternatives to full-scale testing|hydronuclear, cold or subcritical tests]] because no nuclear explosions are possible, even in failure. In these sorts of tests there may be small amounts of chain reaction occurring, but they stop before materially adding to the chemical explosion that causes them. The line here is finely drawn, but, among other things, subcritical testing is not prohibited by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]], while safety tests are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Kalinowski|title=SubCritical Tests|url=http://www.math.yorku.ca/sfp/subcritical.html|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subcritical Experiments|author=Jeffrey Lewis|url=http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/6011/subcritical-experiments|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totals by country==

The table in this section summarizes all worldwide nuclear testing (including the two bombs dropped in combat which were not tests). The country names are links to summary articles for each country, which may in turn be used to drill down to test series articles which contain details on every known nuclear explosion and test. The notes attached to various table cells detail how the numbers therein are arrived at. As of 1993, worldwide, 520 atmospheric nuclear explosions (including 8 underwater) have been conducted with a total yield of 545 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] (Mt): 217&amp;nbsp;Mt from [[Nuclear fission|fission]] and 328&amp;nbsp;Mt from [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]], while the estimated number of underground nuclear tests conducted in the period from 1957 to 1992 is 1,352 explosions with a total yield of 90&amp;nbsp;Mt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-03610-5_17|title=Atmospheric Nuclear Tests|first=O.

==Known tests==

In the following subsections, a selection of significant tests (by no means exhaustive) are listed, representative of the testing effort in each nuclear country.

=== United States of America ===

{{main|List of United States' nuclear weapons tests}}

The standard "official" list of tests for American devices is arguably the [[United States Department of Energy]] DoE-209 document.&lt;ref name=doe209 /&gt; The United States conducted around 1,054 nuclear tests (by official count) between 1945 and 1992, including 216 atmospheric, underwater, and space tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/atest00.html |title=Chronological Listing of Above Ground Nuclear Detonations |publisher=Wm. Robert Johnston |date= |accessdate=2001-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some significant tests conducted by the United States include:
[[File:Crossroads baker explosion.jpg|right|thumb|Shot "Baker" of [[Operation Crossroads]] (1946) was the first underwater nuclear explosion.]]
* The ''[[Trinity test|Trinity]]'' test on 16 July 1945, near [[Socorro, New Mexico]], was the first-ever test of a nuclear weapon (yield of around 20 kilotons).
* The ''[[Operation Crossroads]]'' series in July 1946, at [[Bikini Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], was the first postwar test series and one of the largest military operations in U.S. history.
* The ''[[Operation Greenhouse]]'' shots of May 1951, at [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands, included the first [[boosted fission weapon]] test (named ''Item'') and a scientific test (named ''George'') which proved the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons.
* The ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' shot of 1 November 1952, at Enewetak Atoll, was the first full test of a [[Teller-Ulam design]] "staged" hydrogen bomb, with a yield of 10 megatons. This was not a deployable weapon. With its full [[cryogenic]] equipment it weighed about 82 tons. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* The ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' shot of 1 March 1954, at [[Bikini Atoll]], was the first test of a deployable (solid fuel) thermonuclear weapon, and also (accidentally){{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} the largest weapon ever tested by the United States (15 megatons). It was also the single largest U.S. radiological accident in connection with nuclear testing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The unanticipated yield, and a change in the weather, resulted in [[nuclear fallout]] spreading eastward onto the inhabited [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]] and [[Rongerik Atoll|Rongerik]] atolls, which were soon evacuated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Many of the Marshall Islands natives have since suffered from [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] and have received some compensation from the [[federal government of the United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} A [[Japan]]ese fishing boat, the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'', also came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to grow ill; one eventually died. The crew's exposure was referenced in the film ''Godzilla'' as a criticism of American nuclear tests in the Pacific.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* The ''[[Operation Plumbob]]'' series of  May - October 1957 is considered the biggest, longest, and most controversial test series that occurred within the continental United States. Rainier Mesa, Frenchman Flat, and Yucca Flat were all used for the 29 different atmospheric explosions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/operation-plumbbob-1957 |title=Atomic Heritage Foundation, Operation Plumbbob - 1957 |date= |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shot ''Argus I'' of ''[[Operation Argus]]'', on 27 August 1958, was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon in [[outer space]] when a 1.7-kiloton warhead was detonated at 200 kilometers altitude over the South [[Atlantic Ocean]] during a series of [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]]s.
* Shot ''Frigate Bird'' of ''[[Operation Dominic I and II|Operation Dominic]]'' on 6 May 1962, was the only U.S. test of an operational [[ballistic missile]] with a live nuclear warhead (yield of 600 kilotons), at [[Kiritimati]] (formerly Christmas Island) in the Pacific. In general, missile systems were tested without live warheads and warheads were tested separately for safety concerns. In the early 1960s there were mounting questions about how the systems would behave under combat conditions (when they were "mated", in military parlance), and this test was meant to dispel these concerns. However, the warhead had to be somewhat modified before its use, and the missile was only a [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]] (and not an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]), so by itself it did not satisfy all concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald A. |last=MacKenzie |authorlink=Donald Angus MacKenzie |year=1993 |title=Inventing Accuracy: A Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-63147-1|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QymEXZIWEe8C&amp;pg=PA343 343–344]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shot ''[[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan]]'' of ''[[Operation Storax]]'' on 6 July 1962 (yield of 104 kilotons), was an attempt at showing the feasibility of using nuclear weapons for civilian, peaceful purposes as part of [[Operation Plowshare]]. In this instance, a 1280-feet-in-diameter and 320-feet-deep [[explosion crater]], morphologically similar to an [[impact crater]], was created at the Nevada Test Site.
* Shot ''Divider'' of [[Operation Julin]] on 23 September 1992, at the Nevada Test Site, was the last U.S. nuclear test. Described as a "test to ensure safety of deterrent forces", the series was interrupted by the beginning of negotiations over the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_317.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103041622/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_317.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Soviet atomic bomb project}}

After the fall of the USSR, the American government (as a member of the International Consortium "[[International Science and Technology Center]]") hired a number of top scientists in [[Sarov]] (aka Arzamas-16, the Soviet equivalent of Los Alamos and thus sometimes called "Los Arzamas") to draft a number of documents about the history of the Soviet atomic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yury A Yudin |author2=Project Manager |title=Manuscript on the History of the Soviet Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Infrastructure|url=http://www.partnershipforglobalsecurity-archive.org/Documents/history-manuscript_eng.pdf|accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the documents was the definitive list of Soviet nuclear tests.&lt;ref name="USSRList2"/&gt;  Most of the tests have no code names, unlike the American tests, so they are known by their test numbers from this document.  Some list compilers have detected discrepancies in that list; one device was abandoned in its cove in a tunnel in Semipalatinsk when the Soviets abandoned Kazakhstan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Soviet Nuclear Site in Asia Has Unlikely Sentinel: The U.S.|author=Ellen Barry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/world/asia/22kazakhstan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnston Archive of Nuclear Weapons|author=Wm Robert Johnston|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/|accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists 13 other tests which apparently failed to provide any yield. The source for that was the well respected ''Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces''&lt;ref name=RSNF&gt;{{citation| editor-last=Podvig| editor-first=Pavel| year=2001| title=Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces| publisher=MIT Press| location=Cambridge, MA| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CPRVbYDc-7kC&amp;lpg=PA453| accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which confirms 11 of the 13; those 11 are in the Wikipedia lists.

The [[Soviet Union]] conducted 715 nuclear tests (by the official count)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/Sovtestsum.html |title=Soviet Nuclear Test Summary |publisher=Nuclearweaponarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1949 and 1990, including 219 atmospheric, underwater, and space tests. Most of them took place at the [[Semipalatinsk Test Site]] in [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Novaya Zemlya|Northern Test Site]] at [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Additional industrial tests were conducted at various locations in Russia and Kazakhstan, while a small number of tests were conducted in [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]].

In addition, the [[Totskoye nuclear test|large-scale military exercise]] was conducted by [[Soviet army]] to explore the possibility of defensive and offensive [[warfare]] operations on the nuclear battlefield. The exercise, under code name of "Snezhok" (Snowball), involved detonation of a nuclear bomb twice as powerful as the one used in [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and approximately 45,000 soldiers coming through the [[epicenter]] immediately after the blast&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Suvorov]], ''[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov7/index.html Shadow of Victory]'' ({{lang|ru|Тень победы}}), Donetsk, 2003, {{ISBN|966-696-022-2}}, pages 353–375.&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was conducted on September 14, 1954, under command of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] to the north of [[Totskoye]] village in [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Russia]].

Some significant Soviet tests include:
* ''[[Joe 1|Operation First Lightning/RDS-1]]'' (known as Joe 1 in the West), August 29, 1949: first Soviet nuclear test.
* ''[[Joe 4|RDS-6s]]'' (known as [[Joe 4]] in the West), August 12, 1953: first Soviet thermonuclear test using a sloika (layer cake) design. The design proved to be unscalable into megaton yields, but it was air-deployable.
* ''[[RDS-37]]'', November 22, 1955: first Soviet multi-megaton, "true" hydrogen bomb test using [[Andrei Sakharov]]'s "third idea", essentially a re-invention of the Teller-Ulam.
* ''[[Tsar Bomba]]'', October 30, 1961: largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, with a design yield of 100&amp;nbsp;Mt, de-rated to 50&amp;nbsp;Mt for the test drop.
* ''[[Chagan (nuclear test)|Chagan]]'', January 15, 1965: large cratering experiment as part of [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]] program, which created an artificial lake.

The last Soviet test took place on October 24, 1990. After the dissolution of the USSR in 1992, Russia inherited the USSR's nuclear stockpile, while Kazakhstan inherited the Semipalatinsk nuclear test area, as well as the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], the [[Sary Shagan]] missile/radar test area and three ballistic missile fields.  Semipalatinsk included at least the one unexploded device, later blown up with conventional explosives by a combined USA/Kazakh team. No testing has occurred in the former territory of the USSR since its dissolution.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|United Kingdom's nuclear testing series}}

The United Kingdom has conducted 45 tests (21 in Australian territory, including 9 in mainland [[South Australia]] at [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga]] and [[Emu Field]], 3 at Malden Island and 6 at Kiritibati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands of the central Pacific, and 24 in the U.S. as part of joint test series).

===India===
{{Main|List of Indian nuclear tests}}

[[India]] announced it had conducted a test of a single device in 1974 near Pakistan's [[Pokhran|eastern border]] under the codename ''Operation Smiling Buddha''. After 24 years, India publicly announced five further nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13, 1998. The official number of Indian nuclear tests is six, conducted under two different code-names and at different times.
* May 18, 1974: ''[[Operation Smiling Buddha]]'' (type: implosion, plutonium and underground). One underground test in a horizontal shaft around 107&amp;nbsp;m long under the long-constructed Indian Army [[Pokhran#Pokhran Test Range|Pokhran Test Range]] (IA-PTR) in the [[Thar Desert]], eastern border of Pakistan. The Indian [[India Meteorological Department|Meteorological Department]] and the [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Atomic Energy Commission]] announced the yield of the weapon at 12&amp;nbsp;kt. Other Western sources claimed the yield to be around 2–12&amp;nbsp;kt. However, the claim was dismissed by the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' and it was later reported to be 8&amp;nbsp;kt.&lt;ref name="smiling_buddha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaSmiling.html|title=India's Nuclear Weapons Program - Smiling Buddha: 1974|publisher=Nuclear Weapon Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* May 11, 1998: ''[[Operation Shakti]]'' (type: implosion, 3 uranium and 2 plutonium devices, all underground). The [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) of India and the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) simultaneously conducted a test of three nuclear devices at the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran#Nuclear test site|Pokhran Test Range]] (IAPTR) on May 11, 1998. Two days later, on May 13, the AEC and DRDO carried out a test of two further nuclear devices, detonated simultaneously. During this operation, AEC India claimed to have tested a three-stage thermonuclear device ([[Teller-Ulam design]]), but the yield of the tests was significantly lower than that expected from thermonuclear devices. The yields remain questionable, at best, by Western and Indian scholars, estimated at 20kt-45kt.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Pakistan's nuclear testing series}}

[[Pakistan]] conducted 6 official tests, under 2 different code names, in the final week of May 1998. From 1983 to 1994, around 24 nuclear cold tests were carried out by Pakistan; these remained unannounced and classified until 2000. In May 1998, Pakistan responded publicly by testing 6 nuclear devices.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chidanand Rajghatta, TNN, Sep 21, 2009, 12.00am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-21/pakistan/28104311_1_uf6-enrichment-centrifuge-plant |title=AQ Khan nails Pakistan's nuke lies - Pakistan - World - The Times of India |publisher=The Times of India |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main|North Korea's nuclear testing series}}

On October 9, 2006, [[North Korea]] announced they had conducted [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|a nuclear test]] in [[North Hamgyong Province]] on the northeast coast at 10:36 AM (11:30 AEST). There was a 3.58 magnitude earthquake reported in [[South Korea]]. There was a 4.2 magnitude tremor detected 240 miles north of P'yongyang. The low estimates on the yield of the test—potentially less than a kiloton in strength—have led to speculation as to whether it was a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] (unsuccessful test), or not a genuine ''nuclear'' test at all.

On May 25, 2009, North Korea announced having conducted [[2009 North Korean nuclear test|a second nuclear test]].  A tremor, with magnitude reports ranging from 4.7 to 5.3, was detected at [[Mantapsan]], 233 miles northeast of P'yongyang and within a few kilometers of the 2006 test location.  While estimates as to yield are still uncertain, with reports ranging from 3 to 20 kilotons, the stronger tremor indicates a significantly larger yield than the 2006 test.

On 12 February 2013, [[North Korea]]n state media announced it had conducted [[2013 North Korean nuclear test|an underground nuclear test]], its third in seven years. A tremor that exhibited a nuclear bomb signature with an initial [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 4.9 (later revised to 5.1) was detected by both [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission]] (CTBTO)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: On the CTBTO's detection in North Korea|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2013/on-the-ctbtos-detection-in-north-korea/|publisher=CTBTO|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS).&lt;ref name="USGS report 2013 nuclear test"&gt;{{cite web|title=M5.1 Nuclear Explosion - 24km ENE of Sungjibaegam, North Korea|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usc000f5t0|work=Earthquake Hazards Program|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=12 February 2013|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tremor occurred at 11:57 local time (02:57 [[UTC]]) and the USGS said the [[hypocenter]] of the event was only one [[kilometer]] deep.

On January 5, 2015, North Korean TV news anchors announced that they had successfully tested a "miniaturized atomic bomb", about 5 miles from the Punggye-ri nuclear site where a test was conducted in 2013.

On January 6, 2016, North Korea announced that it conducted a successful test of a hydrogen bomb.

==Alleged tests==
There have been a number of significant alleged/disputed/unacknowledged accounts of countries testing nuclear explosives. Their status is either not certain or entirely disputed by most mainstream experts.

===Germany===
''[[Hitlers Bombe]]'', a book published in German by the historian [[Rainer Karlsch]] in 2005, has alleged that there is evidence that [[Nazi Germany]] performed some sort of test of a "nuclear device" (a hybrid [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] device unlike any modern nuclear weapons), allegedly on 4 March 1945 near the [[German nuclear weapon project#Controversies regarding alleged nuclear tests|Ohrdruf concentration camp]], though the evidence for this has not yet been confirmed, and has been doubted by many historians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Israel===
Israel was reported by a West German army report to have made an underground test in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;June 1976, West Germany army publication 'Wehrtechnik'&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} Historian Taysir Nashif reported a zero yield implosion test in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuclear Weapons in the Middle East: Dimensions and Responsibilities, by Taysir Nashif&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} Scientists from Israel participated in the earliest French nuclear tests before DeGaulle cut off further cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/ Federation of American Scientists report on Israeli nuclear program]&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Korea===
{{Main|Ryanggang explosion}}
On September 9, 2004, it was reported by South Korean media that there had been a large explosion at the Chinese/North Korean border. This explosion left a crater visible by satellite and precipitated a large (2 mile diameter) mushroom cloud. The United States and South Korea quickly downplayed this, explaining it away as a forest fire that had nothing to do with the DPRK's nuclear weapons program.
{{Main|List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea}}
[[North Korea]] has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and 2017. The 3 September 2017 test, like their January 2016 test, is claimed to be a [[hydrogen bomb]] (but may only be a [[boosted fission weapon]] rather than an actual staged Teller–Ulam [[thermonuclear weapon]]).

===Pakistan===
Because Pakistan's nuclear programme was conducted under extreme secrecy, it raised concerns in the Soviet Union and India, who suspected that since the 1974 test it was inevitable that Pakistan would further develop its programme. The pro-Soviet newspaper, ''The Patriot'',  reported that "Pakistan has exploded a nuclear device in the range of 20 to 50 kilotons" in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Pakistan/Nuclear/chronology_1983.html NTI: 1983 in Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414084207/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Pakistan/Nuclear/chronology_1983.html |date=2010-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was widely dismissed by Western diplomats as it was pointed out that ''The Patriot'' had previously engaged in spreading disinformation on several occasions. In 1983, India and the Soviet Union both investigated secret tests but, due to lack of any scientific data, these statements were widely dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;—S.G. Roy, "India Investigates Reported Nuclear Test," United Press International, 25 June 1983, International; in Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe, 25 June 1983, http://web.lexis-nexis.com; "Pakistan Adamantly Rejects Accusation it Tested Bomb," Washington Post, 26 June 1983, First Section, World News, A24; in Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe, 25 June 1983, http://web.lexis-nexis.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book, ''The Nuclear Express'', authors [[Thomas C. Reed|Thomas Reed]] and Danny Stillman also allege that the People's Republic of China allowed Pakistan to detonate a nuclear weapon at its [[Lop Nur]] test site in 1990, eight years before Pakistan held its first official weapons test.&lt;ref name="HiddenTravelsBroad"&gt;William Broad, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/science/09bomb.html "Hidden Travels of the Atomic Bomb"], ''New York Times'' (8 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, senior scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] strongly rejected the claim in May 1998.&lt;ref name="Jang Media Group, Co. "&gt;{{cite web

Additionally, the UK conducted [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|nuclear tests in Australia]] in the 1950s.

===Russia===
The [[Yekaterinburg Fireball]] of November 14, 2014 is alleged by some&lt;ref&gt;The flash light in Siberia, November 14, 2014, a nuclear test in space, Association Pyrophor, August 16, 2015, available at https://assopyrophor.org/2015/08/16/the-flash-light-in-siberia-nov-14-2014-a-nuclear-test-in-space-le-flash-en-siberie-du-14112014-un-test-nucleaire-dans-lespace/, last retrieved 09/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt; to have been a nuclear test in space, which would not have been detected by the [[CTBTO]] because the CTBTO does not have autonomous ways to monitor space nuclear tests (i.e. satellites) and relies thus on information that member States would accept to provide. The fireball happened a few days before a conference in [[Yekaterinburg]] on the theme of air / missile defence.&lt;ref&gt;CSTO Getting Serious About Joint Air Defense System, Joshua Kucera, November 20, 2014, http://www.eurasianet.org/node/71041&lt;/ref&gt; The affirmation, however, is disputed as the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations claimed it was an "on-ground" explosion.&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com"&gt;New evidence that fire in the sky was caused by military, The Siberian Times, November 23, 2014, http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/n0027-new-evidence-that-fire-in-the-sky-was-caused-by-military/&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Siberian Times'', a local newspaper, noted that "the light was not accompanied by any sound".&lt;ref name="siberiantimes.com"/&gt;

===Vela Incident===
The [[Vela Incident]] was an unidentified ''double flash'' of light detected by a partly functional, decommissioned American [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Satellite]] on September 22, 1979 in the [[Indian Ocean]] (near the [[Prince Edward Islands]] off [[Antarctica]]), other sensors which could have recorded proof of a nuclear test were not functioning on this satellite. It is possible that this was produced by a nuclear device. If this flash detection was actually a nuclear test, a popular theory favored in the diary of then sitting American President [[Jimmy Carter]], is that it resulted from a covert joint [[South African]] and [[Israel]]i nuclear test of an advanced highly miniaturized Israeli artillery shell sized device which was unintentionally detectable by satellite optical sensor due to a break in the cloud cover of a typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Hersh|first=Seymour|title=The Samson option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy|isbn=0-394-57006-5|publisher=Random House|year=1991|ref=harv}}, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of the [[South African nuclear program]] later showed only six of the most crude and heavy designs weighing well over 340&amp;nbsp;kg had been built when they finally declared and disarmed their nuclear arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5942:book-review-how-sa-built-six-atom-bombs-&amp;catid=57:Book+Reviews&amp;Itemid=141|title=Book Review: How SA built six atom bombs  - defenceWeb|first=Leon|last=Engelbrecht|website=www.defenceweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1986 [[Mordechai Vanunu|Vanunu]] leaks analyzed by nuclear weapon miniaturization pioneer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] revealed very sophisticated miniaturized Israeli designs among the evidence presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003212249/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/israel-aims.html|title=Israel Aims to Improve Missile Accuracy|date=3 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also suspected were France testing a [[neutron bomb]] near their [[Kerguelen Islands]] territory,&lt;ref&gt;Richelson, Jeffrey T.

==Tests of live warheads on rockets==
[[Image:Operation Dominic - Frigate Bird nuclear explosion.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The Frigate Bird explosion seen through the [[periscope]] of [[USS Carbonero (SS-337)|USS ''Carbonero'' (SS-337)]].]]

Missiles and nuclear warheads have usually been tested separately, because testing them together is considered highly dangerous; they are certainly the most extreme type of [[live fire exercise]]. The only US live test of an operational missile was the following:
* ''Frigate Bird'': on May 6, 1962, a [[UGM-27 Polaris]] A-2 missile with a live 600&amp;nbsp;kt W47 warhead was launched from the [[USS Ethan Allen (SSBN-608)|USS ''Ethan Allen'']]; it flew {{convert|1800|km|abbr=on}}, re-entered the atmosphere, and detonated at an altitude of {{convert|3.4|km|abbr=on}} over the South Pacific.

Other live tests with the nuclear explosive delivered by rocket by the USA include:
* On August 1, 1958, [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket launched nuclear test ''[[Hardtack Teak|Teak]]'' that detonated at an altitude of {{convert|77.8|km|abbr=on}}. On August 12, 1958, Redstone #CC51 launched nuclear test ''Orange'' to a detonation altitude of {{convert|43|km|abbr=on}}. Both were part of ''[[Operation Hardtack I]]'' and had a yield of 3.75&amp;nbsp;Mt
* ''[[Operation Argus]]'': three tests above the South Atlantic Ocean, August 27, August 30, and September 6, 1958
* On July 9, 1962, [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor missile]] launched a Mk4 reentry vehicle containing a W49 thermonuclear warhead to an altitude of 248 miles (400&amp;nbsp;km). The warhead detonated with a yield of 1.45&amp;nbsp;Mt. This was the ''[[Starfish Prime]]'' event of nuclear test operation ''[[Operation Fishbowl|Dominic-Fishbowl]]''
* In the ''[[Operation Fishbowl|Dominic-Fishbowl]]'' series in 1962: ''Checkmate, Bluegill, Kingfish'' and ''Tightrope''
* The 1957 test ''[[Operation Plumbbob|Plumbbob/John]]'' fired a small yield nuclear weapon on a Genie air-to-air rocket from a jet fighter.

The Soviet Union tested nuclear explosives on rockets as part of their development of a localised [[anti-ballistic missile]] system in the 1960s. Some of the Soviet nuclear tests with warheads delivered by rocket include:
* Baikal (USSR Test #25, February 2, 1956, at [[Aralsk]]) – one test, with a [[R-5M]] rocket launch from Kapustin Yar; fizzled.
* ZUR-215 (#34, January 19, 1957, at [[Kapustin Yar]]) – one test, with a rocket launch from Kapustin Yar.
* (#82 and 83, early November 1958) two tests, done after declared cease fire for test moratorium negotiations, from Kapustin Yar.
* Groza (#88, September 6, 1961, at Kapustin Yar) – one test, with a rocket launch from Kapustin Yar.
* Grom (#115, October 6, 1961, at Kapustin Yar) – one test, with a rocket launch from Kapustin Yar.
* Volga (#106 and 108, September 20–22, 1961, at [[Novaya Zemlya]]) – two tests, with [[R-11M]] rockets launch from [[Rogachevo (air base)|Rogachevo]].
* Roza (#94 and 99, September 12–16, 1961, at Novaya Zemlya) – two tests, with [[R-12 Dvina|R-12]] rockets launch from [[Vorkuta]].
* [[Raduga (nuclear test)|Raduga]] (#121, October 20, 1961, at Novaya Zemlya) – one test, with a [[R-13 (missile)|R-13]] rocket launch.
* Tyulpan (#164, September 8, 1962, at Novaya Zemlya) – one test, with [[R-14 Chusovaya|R-14]] rockets launched from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].
* [[Soviet Project K nuclear tests|Operation K]] (1961 and 1962, at [[Sary-Shagan]]) – five tests, at high altitude, with rockets launched from Kapustin Yar.

The People's Republic of China conducted CHIC-4 with a [[Dongfeng-2]] rocket launch in October 27, 1966. The warhead exploded with a yield of 12 kt.

{{War}}

This '''list of wars by death toll''' includes death toll estimates of all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by war. These numbers usually include the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of battle or other military wartime actions, as well as the wartime/war-related deaths of soldiers, which are the results of war-induced epidemics, famines, atrocities, genocide, etc.

David Hacker, "''estimates, based on Census data, indicate that the death toll was at least 750,000, and may have been as high as 850,000''" (study refers only to military casualties)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James M. McPherson, "Battle Cry of Freedom", Oxford University Press, Oct 24, 2003, page 619. "Suffering and death were widespread, nevertheless, and a fair estimate of war-related civilian deaths might total 50,000".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Professor James Downs. [http://blog.oup.com/2012/04/black-white-demographic-death-toll-civil-war/ "Color blindness in the demographic death toll of the Civil War".] Oxford University Press, April 13th 2012. "An 2 April 2012 New York Times article, "New Estimate Raises Civil War Death Toll," reports that a new study ratchets up the death toll from an estimated 650,000 to a staggering 850,000 people. As horrific as this new number is, it fails to reflect the mortality of former slaves during the war. If former slaves were included in this figure, the Civil War death toll would likely be over a million casualties... the rough 19th century estimate was that 60,000 former slaves died from [war-related diseases and starvation], but doctors treating black patients often claimed that they were unable to keep accurate records due to demands on their time and the lack of manpower and resources... tens of thousands of other slaves who died had no contact with army doctors, leaving no records of their deaths".&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Book of the Year''' - given for an author’s first or second book.
*'''Picture Researcher of the Year''' - given to a researcher who has done outstanding work to enhance a text with the creative, imaginative and wide-ranging selection of appropriate images.

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist historiography''', or [[historical materialist]] historiography, is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by [[Marxism]].  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes.

Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. The chief problematic aspect of Marxist historiography has been an argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] factors in creating outcomes.

Marxist history is generally [[Determinism|deterministic]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics|author1=Ben Fine|author2=Alfredo Saad-Filho|author3=Marco Boffo|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xe0VQArHt8sC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=determinism#v=onepage&amp;q=determinism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=marxist+history+deterministic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRsLn61NfXAhUJK48KHXprAcg4ChDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=marxist%20history%20deterministic&amp;f=false|page=5|title=|first=J.J.|last= O'Rourke|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pem7Ip_WUgC&amp;pg=PA247|first=Kenneth|last=Stunkel|page=247|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; it posits a direction of history, towards an end state of history as [[classless]] human society. Marxist historiography, that is, the writing of Marxist history in line with the given historiographical principles, is generally seen as a tool. Its aim is to bring those oppressed by history to [[Self-actualization#Self-actualization|self-consciousness]], and to arm them with tactics and strategies from history: it is both a historical and a liberatory project.

Historians who use Marxist methodology, but disagree with the mainstream of Marxism, often describe themselves as ''marxist'' historians (with a lowercase ''M'').  Methods from Marxist historiography, such as class analysis, can be divorced from the liberatory intent of Marxist historiography; such practitioners often refer to their work as ''marxian'' or ''Marxian''.

==Marx and Engels==

[[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis.

Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society.

Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics.

==Marx and labor==

Key to understanding Marxist historiography is his view of labor. For Marx "historical reality is none other than objectified labor, and all conditions of labor given by nature, including the organic bodies of people, are merely preconditions and 'disappearing moments' of the labor process."&lt;ref&gt;Andrey Maidansky. "The Logic of Marx's History," Russian Studies in Philosophy, vol. 51, no. 2 (Fall 2012): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on the physical as the determining factor in history represents a break from virtually all previous historians. Until Marx developed his theory of [[historical materialism]], the overarching determining factor in the direction of history was some sort of divine agency.  In Marx's view of history "God became a mere projection of human imagination" and more importantly "a tool of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach. Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, 3rd Ed. (Chicago, Il: University of Chicago Press, 2007), pg. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no more sense of divine direction to be seen. History moved by the sheer force of human labor, and all theories of divine nature were a concoction of the ruling powers to keep the working people in check. For Marx, "The first historical act is... the production of material life itself."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As one might expect, Marxist history not only begins with labor, it ends in production: "history does not end by being resolved into "self-consciousness" as "spirit of the spirit," but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor..."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; For further, and much more comprehensive, information on this topic, see [[historical materialism]].

==In the Soviet Union==
{{details|Historiography in the Soviet Union}}

Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Soviet historians tended to avoid contemporary history (history after 1905) where possible and effort was predominantly directed at premodern history.  As history was considered to be a politicised academic discipline, historians limited their creative output to avoid prosecution.

Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s, which was written in order to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]].

==The Communist Party Historians Group in Britain==
{{Main|Communist Party Historians Group}}
A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. They shared a common interest in "history from below" and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. E. P. Thompson famously engaged [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]] in ''[[The Poverty of Theory]]'', arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history, and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.

Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work.

[[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB.

== In India ==
In India, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One debate in Indian history that relates to a [[historical materialist]] schema is on the nature of [[feudalism]] in India. [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] in the 1960s outlined the idea of "feudalism from below" and "feudalism from above". R. S. Sharma largely agrees with Kosambi in his various books.&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''[[Indian Feudalism (book)]], 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation'', Orient Longman, Kolkata, 2001, pp. 177-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''India's Ancient Past'', Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D N Jha, ''The Feudal Order: State Society and Ideology in Early Medieval India'', Manohar Publishers, New Delhi, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Most Indian Marxists argue that the economic origins of communalism are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a "world capitalist system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit women in India: issues and perspective|page=138|first=Prahlad|last=Jogdand|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. R. Ambedkar]] criticized Marxists, as he deemed them to be unaware or ignorant of the specifics of [[caste]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7ffDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167|title=Development-Induced Displacement in India and China: A Comparative Look at the Burdens of Growth|last=Padovani|first=Florence|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|quote=Bhimrao Ambedkar himself, who criticized Indian Marxists}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of [[history of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India|quote=Marxists who always try to cover up the black spots of Muslim rule with thick coats of whitewash|first=Kishori Saran|last=Lal|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Politics, Then and Now: Essays in Historical Perspective|first=K|last=Seshadri|publisher=Pragatee Prakashan|page=5|quote=certain attempts made by some ultra-Marxist historians to justify and even whitewash tyrannical emperors of the medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in World Affairs, Volume 1|first=KR|last=Gupta|publisher=Atlantic Publisher|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw9uf7sRKtIC&amp;pg=PA249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest : 11Th-13th Centuries|last=Wink|first=André|publisher=BRILL|page=309|quote="apologists for Islam, as well as some marxist scholars in India have sometimes attempted to reduce Islamic iconoclasm.."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] scholars especially have polemicized against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.' Marxists are held responsible for aiding or defending [[Islam in India|Muslims]], who figure in Hindu nationalist discourse as the enemy within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0RZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=|title=The Construction of History and Nationalism in India: Textbooks, Controversies and Politics|last=Guichard|first=Sylvie|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a critique is [[Arun Shourie]]'s ''[[Eminent Historians]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, E. E. (2014). Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Cary, USA: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20661">'''Medieval studies''' is the academic interdisciplinary study of the [[Middle Ages]].

==Institutional development==
The term 'medieval studies' began to be adopted by academics in the opening decades of the twentieth century, initially in the titles of books like [[G. G. Coulton]]'s ''Ten Medieval Studies'' (1906), to emphasize a greater interdisciplinary approach to a historical subject. In American and European universities the term provided a coherent identity to centres composed of academics from a variety of disciplines including archaeology, art history, architecture, history, literature and linguistics. The Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael's College of the University of Toronto became the first centre of this type in 1929;&lt;ref&gt;H. Damico, J. B. Zavadil, D. Fennema, and K. Lenz, ''Medieval Scholarship: Philosophy and the arts: biographical studies on the formation of a discipline'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] (PIMS) and is part of the [[University of Toronto]]. It was soon followed by the Medieval Institute at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in Indiana, which was founded in 1946 but whose roots go back to the establishment of a Program of Medieval Studies in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medieval.nd.edu/about-us/our-history/ MI History], University of Notre Dame&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of the early programs at Roman Catholic institutions, it drew its strengths from the revival of medieval scholastic philosophy by such scholars as [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Jacques Maritain]], both of whom made regular visits to the university in the 1930s and 1940s.

These institutions were preceded in the United Kingdom, in 1927, by the establishment of the idiosyncratic [[Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge|Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic]], at [[Cambridge University]]. Although Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic was limited geographically (to the [[British Isles]] and [[Scandinavia]]) and chronologically (mostly the [[early Middle Ages]]), it promoted the interdisciplinarity characteristic of Medieval Studies and many of its graduates were involved in the later development of Medieval Studies programmes elsewhere in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in ''H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge'', ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Aberystwyth University, 2015), {{ISBN|9780955718298}}, pp. 1-58 [=''Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies'', 69/70 (2015)].&lt;/ref&gt;

With university expansion in the late 1960s and early 1970s encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, similar centres were established in England at [[University of Reading]] (1965), at [[University of Leeds]] (1967) and the [[University of York]] (1968), and in the United States at [[Fordham University]] (1971).&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent wave of foundations, perhaps helped by the rise of interest in things medieval associated with [[neo-medievalism]], include centres at [[King's College London]] (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/ahri/centres/clams/about.aspx|title=King's College London -  About us|website=www.kcl.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Bristol]] (1994), the [[University of Sydney]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;D. Metzger and L. J. Workman, ''Medievalism and the academy II: cultural studies'' (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2000), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bangor University]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;G. McMullan and D. Matthews, ''Reading the medieval in early modern England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval studies is buoyed by a number of annual international conferences which bring together thousands of professional medievalists, including the [[International Congress on Medieval Studies]], at [[Kalamazoo]] [[Michigan|MI]], [[United States|U.S.]], and the [[International Medieval Congress]] at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Padenm ''The Future of the Middle Ages: medieval literature in the 1990s'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of journals devoted to medieval studies, including: ''Mediaevalia'', ''Comitatus'', ''Viator'', ''Traditio'', ''[[Medieval worlds|Medieval Worlds]]'', ''Journal of Medieval History'', ''Journal of Medieval Military History'', and ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', an organ of the Medieval Academy of America founded in 1925 and based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Molho, and G. S. Wood, ''Imagined histories: American historians interpret the past'' (Princeton University Press, 1998), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the infrastructure of the field is the [[International Medieval Bibliography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sawyer|first=Peter|title=The Origins of the ''International Medieval Bibliography'': Its Unwritten History (as told by its Founder)|journal=Bulletin of International Medieval Research|year=2009|volume=14 for 2008|pages=57–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macartney|first=Hilary|title=La ''International Medieval Bibliography'' como herramienta de investigación para la historiografía de ciudades medievales y sus territorios|journal=La Ciudad medieval y su influencia territorial: Nájera.

==Historiographical development==
The term 'Middle Ages' first began to be common in English-language history-writing in the early nineteenth century. [[Henry Hallam]]'s 1818 ''View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages'' has been seen as a key stage in the promotion of the term, along with [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s 1853 ''Lectures on Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert I. Moore, 'A Global Middle Ages?', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92 (pp. 82-83).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"medieval, adj. and n.", "middle age, n. and adj." Accessed 5 August 2018. OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/115638; www.oed.com/view/Entry/118142. Accessed 5 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''medievalist'' was, correspondingly, coined by English-speakers in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"medievalist, n." OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/115640. Accessed 5 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

European study of the medieval past was characterised in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by [[romantic nationalism]], as emergent [[nation-states]] sought to legitimise new political formations by claiming that they were rooted in the distant past.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wood, 'Literary Composition and the Early Medieval Historian in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 37-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important example of this use of the Middle Ages was the nation-building that surrounded the [[unification of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Bastian Schlüter, 'Barbarossa's Heirs: nation and Medieval History in Nineteenth-cand Twentieth-Century Germany', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Jussen, 'Between Ideology and Technology: Depicting Charlemagne in Modern Times', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 127-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lübke, 'Germany's Growth to the East: From the Polabian Marches to Germania Slavica', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratives which presented European countries as becoming modern by building on, yet also developing beyond, their medieval heritage, were also important in legimitating European [[colonialism]] elsewhere in the world, by suggesting that colonised regions had ''not'' developed in this way. The most prominent example of this aspect of medieval studies is imperial Britain and its former colonies in the Americas. Both nationalist and colonialist entanglements meant that the study of the Middle Ages in this period had a role in the emergence of [[white supremacism]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen J. Frantzen, &lt;i&gt;Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition&lt;/i&gt; (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Ganim, &lt;i&gt;Medievalism and Orientalism: Three Essays on Literature, Architecture and Cultural Identity&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the early twentieth century also saw new approaches associated with the rise of [[social sciences]] such as [[economic history]] and [[anthropology]], epitomised by the influential [[Annales School]]. In place of what the Annalistes called ''[[histoire événementielle]]'', this work favoured study of large questions over [[longue durée|long periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[Second World War]], the complicity of medievalism in Europe's competitive nationalism led to greatly diminished enthusiasm for medieval studies within the academy—though nationalist deployments of the Middle Ages still existed and remained powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of medievalists in history and language departments fell,&lt;ref&gt;Robert I. Moore, 'A Global Middle Ages?', in &lt;i&gt;The Prospect of Global History&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92 (pp. 83-84).&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging staff to collaborate across different departments; state funding of and university support for archaeology expanded, bringing new evidence but also new methods, disciplinary perspectives, and research questions forward; and the appeal of interdisciplinarity grew. Accordingly, medieval studies turned increasingly away from producing national histories, towards more complex mosaics of regional approaches that worked towards a European scope, partly correlating with post-War [[Europeanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 57-69.&lt;/ref&gt; An example from the apogee of this process was the large [[European Science Foundation]] project [[The Transformation of the Roman World]] that ran from 1993-98.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wood, 'Report: The European Science Foundation's Programme on the Transformation of the Roman World and the Emergence of Early Medieval Europe', ''Early Medieval Europe'', 6 (1997), 217-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in ''The Making of Medieval History'', ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), {{ISBN|9781903153703}}, pp. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst this process, from the 1980s onwards Medieval Studies increasingly responded to intellectual agendas set by [[critical theory]] and [[cultural studies]], with [[empiricism]] and [[philology]] being challenged by or harnessed to topics like the [[history of the body]].&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Bynum, “Why All the Fuss about the Body?

{{creationism2}}

The '''omphalos hypothesis''' is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the [[Age of the universe|universe is billions of years old]] with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past ten thousand years (in keeping with [[flood geology]]), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is entirely due to the creator introducing [[false evidence]] that makes the universe appear much, much older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", [[God]] must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s&lt;ref name="Gardner2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z1NdAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=9780393322385|place=New York|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ὀμφαλός ''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] evidence about the [[age of the Earth]] or [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.

&lt;!-- The omphalos hypothesis is a hypothesis in the sense of [[formal logic]], rather than a [[scientific hypothesis]].{{says who|date=April 2018}}  The term denotes the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] or ''hypothesis'' of a logical [[proposition]].{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What exactly is the antecedent here? "If one attempts to reconcile..."? And what is the consequent? ??}}  In this case, the proposition has two logical outcomes:  either the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, or the objective physical evidence of the universe's age is false.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does it mean for a statement to be the "outcome" of a proposition? Propositions are supposed to have truth values.}} --&gt;
Various supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe's age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|title=The rejection of Omphalos: a note on shifts in the intellectual hierarchy of mid-nineteenth century Britain|last=Roizen|first=Ron|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1982|volume=21|pages=365–369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219011828/http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|archivedate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].

==Development of the idea==

=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the [[creation story in Genesis]] have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]] described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

{{quote|Although the grasses were only a moment old at their creation, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like ... years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]]: Selected Prose Works|series=The Fathers of the Church|volume=91|editor=Kathleen McVey|publisher=Catholic University of America|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8132-1421-4|chapter=Commentary on Genesis.

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth's age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].  Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, ''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' (Part I Book IV Chapter V) that "God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits."  In modern times, Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]] supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, [http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/comments/AGEOFTHEUNIVERSE.htm "The Age of the Universe"].  "The solution to the contradiction between the age of the earth and the universe according to science and the Jewish date of 5755 years since Creation is this: the real age of the universe is 5755 years, but it has misleading evidence of greater age."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gosse published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' in 1857 to explain his answer to this question.  He concluded that the religious tradition was correct.  Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that [[fossil]]s were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work.  Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth's age could not be used to prove the age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His book sold poorly and was widely rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the ''interval theory'' or [[Gap creationism|gap theory of creation]], in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the [[Six Days of Creation|six days of creation]].  This idea was put forward by Archbishop [[John Bird Sumner]] of Canterbury in ''Treatise on the Records of Creation''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian [[John Pye-Smith|John Pye Smith]], was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A third proposal, by French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], held that [[Day-age creationism|the six "days" of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages]] rather than 24-hour periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theologians rejected Gosse's proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies – either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with [[uniformitarianism]], an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, [[John D. Morris]], president of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] wrote in 1990 about the "appearance of age":
{{quote|When Adam was created, he no doubt looked like a mature adult, fully able to walk, talk, care for the garden, etc. When God created fruit trees, they were already bearing fruit. In each case, what He created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Stars, created on Day Four, had to be seen to perform their purpose of usefulness in telling time; therefore, their light had to be visible on Earth right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Did God Create with Appearance of Age?|first=John D.|last=Morris|year= 1990|journal=Acts &amp; Facts |volume=19 |issue=9|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1088/305/|accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of "virtual history". This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the "virtual history" we now see, including the fossils:
{{quote|
This raises one more major point of difference, the handling of the Fall. Briefly, Creation with Appearance of Age runs into a theological snag with things like fossils of fish with other smaller fish in their stomachs: "Do you mean that God chose to paint, of all things, a facade of SUFFERING and DEATH onto the creation when He gave it this arbitrary appearance of age at the time of creation?" The virtual history paradigm recognizes simply that all creation type miracles entail a virtual history, so the Fall, with its creation type miracles (by which the nature of the creation was changed—"subjected to futility") carried with it its own (fallen) virtual history, which is the virtual history we now see. We do not see the original utopian pre-Fall creation with its (presumably utopian) virtual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: Virtual History|first=Gerald E.|last=Aardsma|url=http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/correspondence/virtual_history.php|accessdate=13 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The past president of the Missouri Association for Creation has said:
{{quote|
The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles. Can God—or more accurately—would God create something which at the very moment of its creation has the appearance of age? The short answer to this question may be: How Else? How, indeed, could God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation&amp;nbsp;... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms{{anchor|Last_Thursdayism}}==

===When did false history begin?===
Though Gosse's original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created ''[[in situ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Wilcox, ''God and Evolution:A Faith-Based Understanding'', Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 2004, 30,&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes called '''Last Thursdayism''' by its opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|last=Isaac|first=Mark|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780520249264|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in "the world might as well have been created last Thursday."

The concept is both unverifiable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible even ''in principle'' to subject it to any form of test, by reference to any [[empirical data]], because the empirical data themselves are considered to have been arbitrarily created to look the way they do at every observable level of detail.

===A deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having "created a fake", such as illusions of light in space of stellar explosions ([[supernovae]]) that never really happened, or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountains]] that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

This conception has therefore drawn harsh rebuke from some theologians. Reverend Canon [[Brian Hebblethwaite]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=245 Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], biography online at www.GiffordLectures.org&lt;/ref&gt; for example, preached against [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] Five-minute hypothesis:&lt;ref name=russell5 /&gt;
{{quotation|Bertrand Russell wrote, in ''The Analysis of Mind'': "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, Analysis of Mind, London, ([1921]1924), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The basis for Hebblethwaite's objection, however, is the presumption of a God that would not deceive people about their very humanity—an unprovable presumption that the omphalos hypothesis rejects at the outset. Hebblethwaite also suggests that God necessarily had to create certain elements of the Universe in combination with the creation of man:

{{quotation|To be an adult human being, we have to have gone through a real process of growth and nurture and a real history of interpersonal relation in a real and specific culture. One can even suggest that it is necessary for the Creator to have fashioned us in and through a whole evolving physical universe. As, again, Austin Farrer put it, "if God wished to make no more than any single one of us, he would need to make half a universe. And why? Because no one of us would be the creature he is, if a thousand thousand lines of converging history, both physical and personal, had not met in him. Your life or mine is but a half-sentence in the book of the world. Tear it from its place, and it cannot be read; or if it can be read, it signifies nothing".&lt;ref name="Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite"&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/files/christchair/Hebblethwaite%20In%20Defence%20of%20Christianity.pdf Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], In Defence of Christianity March 6, 2005, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Brian Hebblethwaite]]|source=}}

In a rebuttal of the claim that God might have implanted a false history of the age of the Universe in order to test our faith in the truth of the Torah, [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]], an author whose works have been banned by several [[Haredi]] rabbis for going against the tenets of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Safran, [http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm "Gedolei Yisroel Condemn Rabbi Nosson Slifkin's Books"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229212121/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm |date=2007-12-29 }}. Dei'ah veDibur, January 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

{{quotation|God essentially created two conflicting accounts of Creation: one in nature, and one in the [[Torah]]. How can it be determined which is the real story, and which is the fake designed to mislead us? One could equally propose that it is nature which presents the real story, and that the Torah was devised by God to test us with a fake history!

One has to be able to rely on God's truthfulness if religion is to function. Or, to put it another way—if God went to enormous lengths to convince us that the world is billions of years old, who are we to disagree?&lt;ref&gt;Slifkin, p167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Five-minute hypothesis===
The '''five-minute hypothesis''' is a [[skeptical hypothesis]] put forth by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human [[memory]] and all other signs of history included. It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme [[philosophical skepticism]] with regard to memory.&lt;ref name=russell5&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Russell | first1 = Bertrand | authorlink1 = Bertrand Russell | title = Analysis of Mind | year = 1921 | publisher = G.

[[File:Cara-oculta-luna.jpg|thumb|The Moon's heavily cratered [[Far side of the Moon|far-side]]]]

The '''origin of the Moon''' is usually explained by a [[Mars]]-sized body striking the Earth, making a debris ring that eventually collected into a single [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], but there are a number of variations on this [[giant-impact hypothesis]], as well as alternate explanations, and research into how the Moon came to be continues.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140907"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Revisiting the Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html |date=September 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed scenarios include captured body, fission, formed together (condensation theory), [[planetesimal]] collisions (formed from asteroid-like bodies), and collision theories.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;[http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_formation.html Theories of Formation for the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard giant-impact hypothesis suggests the Mars-sized body, called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], impacted Earth, creating a large debris ring around Earth, which then accreted to form the Moon. This collision also resulted in the 23.5° [[Axial tilt|tilted axis]] of the earth, thus causing the seasons.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; The Moon's [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotopic]] ratios seem to be essentially identical to Earth's.&lt;ref name=wiechert&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Oxygen Isotopes and the Moon-Forming Giant Impact  | last1=Wiechert | first1=U. | last2=Halliday | first2=A.

{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
{{quote box|width=22em|"One of the challenges to the longstanding theory of the collision, is that a Mars-sized impacting body, whose composition likely would have differed substantially from that of Earth, likely would have left Earth and the moon with different chemical compositions, which they are not."|—NASA&lt;ref name=nasa1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/moon_formation.html NASA Lunar Scientists Develop New Theory on Earth and Moon Formation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Lunar Sample 61016 - Big Muley.jpg|thumb|right|Lunar sample 61016, better known as "[[Big Muley]]"]]
Some theories have been stated that presume the Earth had no large moons early in the formation of the Solar System, 4.6 billion years ago, Earth being basically rock and lava. Theia, an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of this ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.

The hypothesis requires a collision between a body about 90% of the present size of Earth, and another the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial radius and a tenth of its mass). The colliding body has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient angular momentum to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.

[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tons of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the [[temperature]] would have risen to 10,000&amp;nbsp;°C (18,000&amp;nbsp;°F).

The Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core is explained by Theia's core accreting into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccreation of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[magma]] ocean.

The newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small pre-existing satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth–Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = J. H. Jones | title = TESTS OF THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS | work = Origin of the Earth and Moon Conference | url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/origin98/pdf/4045.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is lunar and Earth isotope comparisons. In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.&lt;ref name=wiechert/&gt; Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar system bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (&lt;1 percent).&lt;ref name=ps2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3–4 |date=October 2007 | pages=438–449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;
[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/4673/titanium-paternity-test-says-earth-is-the-moons-only-parent Titanium Paternity Test Says Earth is the Moon's Only Parent (University of Chicago)]&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Giant impact hypothesis#Difficulties|conflicts]] with the Moon forming far from Earth's orbit.

To help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies—each five times the size of Mars—collided, then re-collided, forming a large disc of debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; The paper was called “Forming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact,” by R.M Canup.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;

A 2012 study on the depletion of [[zinc]] isotopes on the Moon supported the giant-impact origin for Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7420/full/nature11507.html Paniello, et al. - Zinc isotopic evidence for the origin of the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a study was released that indicated that water in lunar magma is indistinguishable from [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s and nearly the same as that of Earth in [[Isotopic signature|isotopic composition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ Earth-Moon: A Watery "Double-Planet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807172422/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ |date=2013-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6138/1317.abstract A. Saal, et al. - Hydrogen Isotopes in Lunar Volcanic Glasses and Melt Inclusions Reveal a Carbonaceous Chondrite Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant-impact hypothesis was again challenged in September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | author = Daniel Clery | title = Impact Theory Gets Whacked | volume = 342 | page = 183 | date = 11 October 2013 | doi=10.1126/science.342.6155.183 | pmid=24115419}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a growing sense that lunar origins are more complicated.{{Vague|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name=clery&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6155/183 Daniel Clery -Impact Theory Gets Whacked]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of California]] developed computer models demonstrating that one possible outcome of a [[Disrupted planet|planetary collision]] is that it creates a [[synestia]], a mass of vaporized rock and metal which form a [[torus]] extending beyond the lunar orbit. The synestia will eventually shrink and cool to create the satellite and reform the impacted planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Javier Barbuzano |title=Could a Giant Impact Have Vaporized Earth to Create the Moon? |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/could-a-giant-impact-have-vaporized-earth-to-create-the-moon/ |date=March 1, 2018 |work=Sky and Telescope |accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that before the giant impact, Earth had one or more normal satellites that shared its composition. Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and so Earth.

In 2017, planetary researchers at Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel offered a new theory that suggests the moon was forged in a brutal rain of cosmic debris that repeatedly hammered the fledgling Earth over millions of years. They determined that a series of smaller impacts, which were likely more common in the early solar system, could blast enough Earth rocks and dirt into orbit to form a small moonlet. As repeated impacts created more balls of debris, the moonlets could merge over time into one large moon.&lt;ref name="WSJ-20170109"&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Lee Hotz |title=Researchers Suggest New Theory for the Moon’s Origin |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-suggest-new-theory-for-the-moons-origin-1483977602|date=January 9, 2017 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capture ===
This hypothesis states that the Moon was captured by the Earth.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; This was popular until the 1980s, and some things in favor of this model include the Moon's size, orbit, and tidal locking.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt;

One problem is understanding the capture mechanism.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; A close encounter with Earth typically results in either collision or altered trajectories. For this hypothesis to function, there might have been a large [[atmosphere]] around the primitive Earth, which would slow the movement of the Moon by natural [[aerobraking]] before it could escape. That hypothesis may also explain the [[irregular satellite]] orbits of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Image:Earth-moon-to-scale.svg|thumb|center|800px|Earth and Moon to scale, 500 km per pixel]]

===Fission===
This is the now discredited hypothesis that an ancient, rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of its mass.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180323131439/http://lunarorigin.com:80/lunar-origin-models/ Lunar Origin]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was proposed by [[George Darwin]] (son of the famous biologist [[Charles Darwin]]) in the 1800s and retained some popularity until Apollo.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; The Austrian geologist Otto Ampherer in 1925 also suggested the emerging of the Moon as cause for [[continental drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01558835?LI=true#page-1 Die Naturwissenschaften, July 1925 (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed that the [[Pacific Ocean]] represented the scar of this event.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; Today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young, about 200 million years old or less, whereas the Moon is much older. The Moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material, which originated inside the proto-Earth in the Precambrian.&lt;ref name=Zhang/&gt;

[[File:Lunar Thorium concentrations.jpg|thumb|Thorium concentrations on the Moon, as mapped by ''[[Lunar Prospector]]'']]

===Accretion===
The hypothesis of accretion suggests that the Earth and the Moon formed together as a double system from the primordial [[accretion disk]] of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="The Formation of the Moon"&gt;[http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/lunaform.html The Formation of the Moon] burro.cwru.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system or why the Moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the Earth (25% of its radius compared to 50% for the Earth).&lt;ref name="The Formation of the Moon"/&gt;

===2011===
In 2011, it was theorized that a second moon existed 4.5 billion years ago, and later had an impact with the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10289 | volume=476 | title=Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon | year=2011 | journal=Nature | pages=69–72 | last1 = Jutzi | first1 = M.| bibcode=2011Natur.476...69J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plica''' (from [[Latin]] ''plica'' - fold) is a term from [[sigillography]] for the reinforcement of the lower edge of a [[charter]] or [[deed]], produced by folding up the bottom of the sheet of [[parchment]] to achieve a double thickness. 

The purpose of the fold is to provide a more secure anchorage for the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], and to guard against the parchment being torn. Slots were normally cut in the double thickness of parchment, a cord or tag of parchment threaded through them, and the seal attached to that.

'''Progress''' is the idea that advances in [[technology]], [[science]], and [[social organization]] can produce an improvement in the [[human condition]], and therefore that entire [[societies]], and humanity in general, can improve in terms of their social, political, and economic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;  This may happen as a result of direct human action, as in [[social enterprise]] or through [[activism]], or as a natural part of [[sociocultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, R., 2017. History of the Idea of Progress. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th century [[social theory|social theories]], especially [[social evolution]] as described by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. It was present in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]]. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

==Measuring progress==
Specific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.&lt;ref&gt;Slaboch, M.W., 2017.

[[GDP]] growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the [[sustainability]] of economic activity. [[Wikiprogress]] has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. [http://www.humanprogress.org/ HumanProgress.org] is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.

The [[Social Progress Index]] is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.

Indices that can be used to measure progress include:

* [[Broad measures of economic progress]]
* [[Disability-adjusted life year]]
* [[Green national product]]
* [[Gender-related Development Index]]
* [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]

==Scientific progress==
{{see also|History of science|Technological change|Invention}}
'''Scientific progress''' is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of [[scientific knowledge]] to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wesseling|first=Henk|date=August 1998|title=History: Science or art?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/history-science-or-art/1D3620AE5FCD4AA371AC99E352260E68|journal=European Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–267|doi=10.1017/S106279870000329X|issn=1474-0575|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

This process differs from [[non-science]] fields, such as human languages or history:  the people who spoke a now-extinct language, or who lived through a historical time period, can be said to have known different things from the scholars who studied it later, but they cannot be said to know less about their lives than the modern scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some valid knowledge is lost through the passage of time, and other knowledge is gained, with the result that the non-science fields do not make scientific progress towards understanding their subject areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Aspects of social progress, as described by [[Condorcet]], have included the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
How progress improved the degraded status of women in traditional society was a major theme of historians starting in the Enlightenment and continuing to today.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Ann Taylor (1999). "Feminism, Social Science, and the Meanings of Modernity: the Debate on the Origin of the Family in Europe and the United States, 1860–914," ''American Historical Review'' '''104''' (4): 1085–113; Nyland, Chris (1993). "Adam Smith, Stage Theory, and the Status of Women," ''History of Political Economy'' '''25''' (4): 617–40.&lt;/ref&gt; British theorists [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] (1721–1793) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797), along with many of their contemporaries, remained committed to Christian- and [[republicanism|republican-based]] conceptions of virtue, while working within a new Enlightenment paradigm. The political agenda related beauty, taste, and morality to the imperatives and needs of modern societies of a high level of sophistication and differentiation. Two themes in the work of Robertson and Burke—the nature of women in 'savage' and 'civilized' societies and 'beauty in distress'—reveals how long-held convictions about the character of women, especially with regard to their capacity and right to appear in the public domain, were modified and adjusted to the idea of progress and became central to an enlightened affirmation of modern European civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Kontler, László (2004). "Beauty or Beast, or Monstrous Regiments? Robertson and Burke on Women and the Public Scene," ''Modern Intellectual History'' '''1''' (3): 305–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics experts have examined the status of women in the ancient world, concluding that in the Roman Empire, with its superior social organization, internal peace, and rule of law, allowed women to enjoy a somewhat better standing than in ancient Greece, where women were distinctly inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Robert William, &amp; Chris Nyland (2003). ''The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought''.Edward Elgar Publishing, p. 109; Ryrie, Charles Caldwell (1958). ''The Place of Women in the Church'', The Macmillan Company, Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status of women in traditional China has raised the issue of whether the idea of progress requires a thoroughgoing reject of traditionalism—a belief held by many Chinese reformers in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vernoff, Edward, &amp; Peter J. Seybolt, (2007). ''Through Chinese Eyes: Tradition, Revolution, and Transformation'', APEX Press, pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Leo Marx and [[Bruce Mazlish]] asking, "Should we in fact abandon the idea of progress as a view of the past," answer that there is no doubt "that the status of women has improved markedly" in cultures that have adopted the Enlightenment idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Leo, &amp; Bruce Mazlish (1998). ''Progress: Fact or Illusion?''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernization==
{{main|Modernization}}
Modernization was promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Joyce; Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob (1995). ''Telling the Truth about History''. W.W. Norton, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe [[social commentary|social commentators]] and [[philosopher]]s began to realize that people ''themselves'' could change society and change their way of life. Instead of being made completely by gods, there was increasing room for the idea that people themselves ''made their own society''—and not only that, as [[Giambattista Vico]] argued, ''because'' people made their own society, they could also fully comprehend it. This gave rise to new sciences, or [[proto-science]]s, which claimed to provide new scientific knowledge about what society was like, and how one may change it for the better.&lt;ref&gt;The following annotated reference list appears in [[J. B. Bury]]'s study: ''The Idea of Progress,'' published in 1920 and [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4557/4557-h/4557-h.htm available in full on the web]:
{{Quote|The history of the idea of Progress has been treated briefly and partially by various French writers; e.g. Comte, {{lang|fr|Cours de philosophie positive}}, vi. 321 sqq.; Buchez, {{lang|fr|Introduction a la science de l'histoire}}, i. 99 sqq. (ed. 2, 1842); Javary, {{lang|fr|De l'idee de progres}} (1850); Rigault, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}} (1856); Bouillier, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la philosophie cartesienne}} (1854); Caro, {{lang|fr|Problemes de la morale sociale}} (1876); Brunetiere, "{{lang|fr|La Formation de l'idee de progres|italic=no}}", in {{lang|fr|Etudes critiques}}, 5e serie. More recently M. Jules Delvaille has attempted to trace its history fully, down to the end of the eighteenth century. His {{lang|fr|Histoire de l'idee de progres}} (1910) is planned on a large scale; he is erudite and has read extensively. But his treatment is lacking in the power of discrimination. He strikes one as anxious to bring within his net, as {{lang|fr|theoriciens du progres}}, as many distinguished thinkers as possible; and so, along with a great deal that is useful and relevant, we also find in his book much that is irrelevant. He has not clearly seen that the distinctive idea of Progress was not conceived in antiquity or in the Middle Ages, or even in the Renaissance period; and when he comes to modern times he fails to bring out clearly the decisive steps of its growth. And he does not seem to realize that a man might be "progressive" without believing in, or even thinking about, the doctrine of Progress. Leonardo da Vinci and Berkeley are examples. In my ''Ancient Greek Historians'' (1909) I dwelt on the modern origin of the idea (p. 253 sqq.). Recently Mr. R. H. Murray, in a learned appendix to his ''Erasmus and Luther'', has developed the thesis that Progress was not grasped in antiquity (though he makes an exception of Seneca),—a welcome confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this gave rise to [[Progressivism|progressive]] opinion, in contrast with conservational opinion. The social conservationists were skeptical about [[panacea]]s for social ills. According to conservatives, attempts to radically remake society normally make things worse. [[Edmund Burke]] was the leading exponent of this, although later-day liberals like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] have espoused similar views. They argue that society changes organically and naturally, and that grand plans for the remaking of society, like the [[French Revolution]], [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]] hurt society by removing the traditional constraints on the exercise of power.

The scientific advances of the 16th and 17th centuries provided a basis for [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon's]] book the [[New Atlantis]]. In the 17th century, [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] described progress with respect to arts and the sciences, saying that each age has the advantage of not having to rediscover what was accomplished in preceding ages. The epistemology of [[John Locke]] provided further support and was popularized by the Encyclopedists [[Diderot]], [[Holbach]], and [[Condorcet]]. Locke had a powerful influence on the American [[Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, Thomas L. (1990). ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete statement of progress is that of [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], in his "A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind" (1750). For Turgot, progress covers not only the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture—manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society. [[Condorcet]] predicted the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s (1806–1873) ethical and political thought demonstrated faith in the power of ideas and of intellectual education for improving human nature or behavior. For those who do not share this faith the idea of progress becomes questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) pp. 224–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), a British economist of the early 20th century, was a proponent of classical liberalism. In his highly influential ''Principles of Economics'' (1890), he was deeply interested in human progress and in what is now called ''sustainable development.'' For Marshall, the importance of wealth lay in its ability to promote the physical, mental, and moral health of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Caldari, Katia (2004). "Alfred Marshall's Idea of Progress and Sustainable Development," ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'', '''26''' (4): 519–36.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the modernization and development programs undertaken in the Third World were typically based on the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1989). ''Economic Development: The History of an Idea''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia the notion of progress was first imported from the West by [[Peter the Great]] (1672–1725). An absolute ruler, he used the concept to modernize Russia and to legitimize his monarchy (unlike its usage in Western Europe, where it was primarily associated with political opposition). By the early 19th century, the notion of progress was being taken up by Russian intellectuals and was no longer accepted as legitimate by the tsars. Four schools of thought on progress emerged in 19th-century Russia: conservative (reactionary), religious, liberal, and socialist—the latter winning out in the form of Bolshevist materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Herbert J. (1965). "Economic Modernization in Imperial Russia: Purposes and Achievements," ''Journal of Economic History'' '''25''' (4): 523–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual leaders of the American Revolution, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], were immersed in Enlightenment thought and believed the idea of progress meant that they could reorganize the political system to the benefit of the human condition; both for Americans and also, as Jefferson put it, for an "[[Empire of Liberty]]" that would benefit all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–1884) was one of the most influential political theorists in Argentina. Economic liberalism was the key to his idea of progress. He promoted faith in progress, while chiding fellow Latin Americans for blind copying of American and European models. He hoped for progress through promotion of immigration, education, and a moderate type of federalism and republicanism that might serve as a transition in Argentina to true democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, John E. (1973). "Juan Bautista Alberdi: A Study of His Thought," ''Americas'' '''29''' (4): 489–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, [[Jose Mora]] (1795–1856) was a leader of [[classical liberalism]] in the first generation after independence, leading the battle against the conservative trinity of the army, the church, and the ''hacendados''. He envisioned progress as both a process of human development by the search for philosophical truth and as the introduction of an era of material prosperity by technological advancement. His plan for Mexican reform demanded a republican government bolstered by widespread popular education free of clerical control, confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical lands as a means of redistributing income and clearing government debts, and effective control of a reduced military force by the government. Mora also demanded the establishment of legal equality between native Mexicans and foreign residents. His program, untried in his lifetime, became the key element in the Mexican Constitution of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, John M. (1972). "Jose Mora: His Idea of Progress and the Origins of Mexican Liberalism," ''North Dakota Quarterly'' '''40''' (2): 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the "Mezzogiorno" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the race.&lt;ref&gt;DalLago, Enrico (2002). ''The American South and the Italian Mezzogiorno: Essays in Comparative History''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, in the 20th century the [[KMT]] or Nationalist party, which ruled from the 1920s to the 1940s, advocated progress. The Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] adopted western models and their ruinous projects caused mass famines. After Mao's death, however, the new regime led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1904–1997) and his successors aggressively promoted modernization of the economy using capitalist models and imported western technology.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, Dmitry (2004). "Deng Xiaoping and the Modernization of China," ''Far Eastern Affairs'' '''32''' (4): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among environmentalists, there is a continuum between two opposing poles. The one pole is optimistic, progressive, and business-oriented, and endorses the classic idea of progress. For example, [[bright green environmentalism]] endorses the idea that new designs, social innovations and green technologies can solve critical environmental challenges. The other is pessimistic in respect of technological solutions,&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 9, "Technological Optimism and Belief in Progress", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; warning of impending global crisis (through [[climate change]] or [[peak oil]], for example) and tends to reject the very idea of modernity and the myth of progress that is so central to modernization thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001). ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''. Cambridge University Press, pp 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], wrote about progress as a myth benefiting the few, and a pending environmental doomsday for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the philosophy of [[Deep Ecology]].

==Philosophy==
Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] said that "No single idea has been more important than ... the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years",&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defines five "crucial premises" of the idea of progress:
# value of the past
# nobility of Western civilization
# worth of economic/technological growth
# faith in reason and scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason
# intrinsic importance and worth of life on earth

Sociologist [[P. A. Sorokin]] said, "The ancient Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and most of the medieval thinkers supporting theories of rhythmical, cyclical or trendless movements of social processes were much nearer to reality than the present proponents of the linear view".&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Sorokin, 1932 paper, quoted in Fay (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Confucianism and to a certain extent Taoism, that both search for an ideal past, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition believes in the fulfillment of history, which was translated into the idea of progress in the modern age. Therefore, Chinese proponents of modernization have looked to western models. According to Thompson, the late Qing dynasty reformer, Kang Youwei, believed he had found a model for reform and "modernisation" in the Ancient Chinese Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Youwei, Kang, &amp; Lawrence G. Thompson (1958). ''Ta T'ung Shu: The One World Philosophy of Kang Yu-wei.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that progress was not fully adequate as a scientific explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1957). ''The Poverty of Historicism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], a self-proclaimed [[neo-luddism|neo-luddite]] author, wrote exclusively about progress as a myth, in an essay entitled "Five Facets of a Myth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) says that proponents of progress underestimated the extent of man's destructiveness and irrationality, while critics misunderstand the role of rationality and morality in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers (1965) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychoanalyst [[Charles Baudouin]] claimed modernity has retained the "corollary" of the progress myth, the idea that the present is superior to the past, while at the same time insisting that it is free of the myth:
{{quote|sign=|source=|
The last two centuries were familiar with the myth of progress. Our own century has adopted the myth of modernity. The one myth has replaced the other. ...

Men ceased to believe in progress; but only to pin their faith to more tangible realities, whose sole original significance had been that they were the instruments of progress. ..

This exaltation of the present ... is a corollary of that very faith in progress which people claim to have discarded. The present is superior to the past, by definition, only in a mythology of progress. Thus one retains the corollary while rejecting the principle. There is only one way of retaining a position of whose instability one is conscious. One must simply refrain from thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudouin]], ''The Myth of Modernity'', ''Le Mythe du moderne'' (1946), as translated by [[Bernard Miall]] (1950), sections 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A cyclical theory of history was adopted by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), a German historian who wrote ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' in 1920. [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the rise of [[totalitarianism]] demonstrated that progress was not automatic and that technological improvement did not necessarily guarantee democracy and moral advancement. British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975) felt that Christianity would help modern civilization overcome its challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Farrenkopf, John (1993). "Spengler's Historical Pessimism and the Tragedy of our Age," ''Theory and Society'' Vol. 22, Number 3, pp. 391–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffersonians said that history is not exhausted but that man may begin again in a new world. Besides rejecting the lessons of the past, they Americanized the idea of progress by democratizing and vulgarizing it to include the welfare of the common man as a form of [[republicanism]]. As Romantics deeply concerned with the past, collecting source materials and founding historical societies, the Founding Fathers were animated by clear principles. They saw man in control of his destiny, saw virtue as a distinguishing characteristic of a republic, and were concerned with happiness, progress, and prosperity. Thomas Paine, combining the spirit of rationalism and romanticism, pictured a time when America's innocence would sound like a romance, and concluded that the fall of America could mark the end of 'the noblest work of human wisdom.'&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] wrote in 1920:&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/ideaofprogressin00buryuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Idea of Progress'']. London: Macmillan and Co., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the minds of most people the desirable outcome of human development would be a condition of society in which all the inhabitants of the planet would enjoy a perfectly happy existence....It cannot be proved that the unknown destination towards which man is advancing is desirable.

The Progress of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal immortality. It is true or it is false, and like them it cannot be proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith.}}

In the [[postmodernist]] thought steadily gaining ground from the 1980s, the grandiose claims of the modernizers are steadily eroded, and the very concept of social progress is again questioned and scrutinized.  In the new vision, radical modernizers like [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] appear as [[totalitarian]] despots, whose vision of social progress is held to be totally deformed.  Postmodernists question the validity of 19th century and 20th century notions of progress—both on the capitalist and the Marxist side of the spectrum. They argue that both capitalism and Marxism over-emphasize technological achievements and material prosperity while ignoring the value of inner [[happiness]] and [[Wiktionary:peace of mind|peace of mind]]. Postmodernism posits that both dystopia and utopia are one and the same, overarching grand narratives with impossible conclusions.

{{anchor|Myth of Progress}}{{see also|Progress trap}}
Some 20th-century authors refer to the "Myth of Progress" to refer to the idea that the human condition will inevitably improve. In 1932, English physician [[Montague David Eder]] wrote: "The myth of progress states that civilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable direction. Progress is inevitable... Philosophers, men of science and politicians have accepted the idea of the inevitability of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= David Eder | first=Montague | year=1932 | title=The Myth of Progress | journal=D.

Psycho-Anal | volume=14 | pages=399 | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=IJP.014.0399A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eder argues that the advancement of civilization is leading to greater unhappiness and loss of control in the environment. The strongest critics of the idea of progress complain that it remains a dominant idea in the 21st century, and shows no sign of diminished influence. As one fierce critic, British historian [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (b. 1948), concludes:&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (2004). "An Illusion with a Future," ''Daedalus'' Vol. 133(3), pp 10+; also Gray (2004). ''Heresies: Against Progress and Other Illusions''. Granta Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Faith in the liberating power of knowledge is encrypted into modern life.

The illusion that through science humans can remake the world is an integral part of the modern condition. Renewing the eschatological hopes of the past, progress is an illusion with a future.}}

Recently the idea of progress has been generalized to psychology, being related with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as "what counts as a means of advancing towards the end result of a given defined goal."&lt;ref&gt;Cerbaro, R. H. and Whisler, J. L. (2016). The Idea of Progress: A Theoretical and Concise Goal-Structure Model. Current Research in Psychology, 7 (1): 12.15, p. 13.

===Antiquity===

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] said that thought in [[ancient Greece]] was dominated by the theory of world-cycles or the doctrine of eternal return, and was steeped in a belief parallel to the Judaic "[[Original sin|fall of man]]," but rather from a preceding "[[Golden Age]]" of innocence and simplicity. Time was generally regarded as the enemy of humanity which depreciates the value of the world. He credits the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] with having had a potential for leading to the foundation of a theory of progress through their materialistic acceptance of the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] as the explanation for a world without an intervening [[deity]].
{{cquote|For them, the earliest condition of men resembled that of the beasts, and from this primitive and miserable condition they laboriously reached the existing state of civilisation, not by external guidance or as a consequence of some initial design, but simply by the exercise of human intelligence throughout a long period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}

[[Robert Nisbet]] and [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] have attributed a notion of progress to other Greeks. [[Xenophanes]] said "The gods did not reveal to men all things in the beginning, but men through their own search find in the course of time that which is better." [[Plato]]'s Book III of ''[[The Laws]]'' depicts humanity's progress from a state of nature to the higher levels of culture, economy, and polity. Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'' also outlines a historical account of the progress of mankind.

===Renaissance===
During the Medieval period, science was to a large extent based on [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] (a method of thinking and learning from the [[Middle Ages]]) interpretations of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] work. The Renaissance of the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries changed the mindset in Europe towards an empirical view, based on a [[pantheistic]] interpretation of [[Plato]]. This induced a revolution in curiosity about nature in general and scientific advance, which opened the gates for technical and economic advance. Furthermore, the individual potential was seen as a never-ending quest for being God-like, paving the way for a view of Man based on unlimited perfection and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst; Paul Oskar Kristeller and John Herman Randall (eds., 1948). ''The Renaissance Philosophy of Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Enlightenment (1650–1800)===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French historian and philosopher [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) was a major proponent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At first Voltaire's thought was informed by the idea of progress coupled with rationalism. His subsequent notion of the historical idea of progress saw science and reason as the driving forces behind societal advancement.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) argued that progress is neither automatic nor continuous and does not measure knowledge or wealth, but is a painful and largely inadvertent passage from barbarism through civilization toward enlightened culture and the abolition of war. Kant called for education, with the education of humankind seen as a slow process whereby world history propels mankind toward peace through war, international commerce, and [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, Jeanne A. (1991). "Reasonable Hope: Kant as Critical Theorist," ''History of European Ideas'', '''21''' (4): 527–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish theorist [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816) defined human progress as the working out of a divine plan, though he rejected predestination. The difficulties and dangers of life provided the necessary stimuli for human development, while the uniquely human ability to evaluate led to ambition and the conscious striving for excellence. But he never adequately analyzed the competitive and aggressive consequences stemming from his emphasis on ambition even though he envisioned man's lot as a perpetual striving with no earthly culmination. Man found his happiness only in effort.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, John Andrew (1978). "Adam Ferguson and the Idea of Progress," ''Studies in Burke and His Time'' '''19''' (2): 99–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the Enlightenment, as a [[secularization]] of ideas from early [[Christianity]], and a reworking of ideas from [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIZfQTd3nSMC&amp;pg=PA402 The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought] By David Miller, Janet Coleman, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein takes a minority view in seeing evidence for ''The Idea of Progress in Classical Antiquity'', Johns Hopkins Press (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
In the 19th century, Romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically better the human condition, and in some ways could make it worse.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Christopher John, ed. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850''. Fitzroy Dearborn, Vol.  II, p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) reacted against the concept of progress as set forth by William Godwin and Condorcet because he believed that inequality of conditions is "the best (state) calculated to develop the energies and faculties of man". He said, "Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state". He argued that man's capacity for improvement has been demonstrated by the growth of his intellect, a form of progress which offsets the distresses engendered by the law of population.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Samuel M. (1966). "Malthus and the Idea of Progress," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''27''' (1): 92–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) criticized the idea of progress as the 'weakling's doctrines of optimism,' and advocated undermining concepts such as faith in progress, to allow the strong individual to stand above the plebeian masses. An important part of his thinking consists of the attempt to use the classical model of 'eternal recurrence of the same' to dislodge the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Tassone, Giuseppe (2002). ''A Study on the Idea of Progress in Nietzsche, Heidegger and Critical Theory''. E. Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) argues there was general agreement in the late 19th century that the steady accumulation of knowledge and the progressive replacement of conjectural, that is, theological or metaphysical, notions by scientific ones was what created progress. Most scholars concluded this growth of scientific knowledge and methods led to the growth of industry and the transformation of warlike societies into an industrial and pacific one. They agreed as well that there had been a systematic decline of coercion in government, and an increasing role of liberty and of rule by consent. There was more emphasis on impersonal social and historical forces; progress was increasingly seen as the result of an inner logic of society.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers, George G. (1965). "The Idea of Progress: A Critical Reassessment," ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist theory (late 19th century)===
Marx developed a theory of [[historical materialism]]. He describes the mid-19th century condition in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty, and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all which is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind.&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto of the Communist Party: Chapter 1, Marx &amp; Engels&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, Marx described the process of social progress, which in his opinion is based on the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production:

{{Quote|No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Preface|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm|work=Critique of political economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Capitalism]] is thought by Marx as a process of continual change, in which the growth of markets dissolve all fixities in human life, and Marx admits that capitalism is progressive and non-[[reactionary]]. [[Marxism]] further states that capitalism, in its quest for higher profits and new markets, will inevitably sow the seeds of its own destruction. Marxists believe that, in the future, capitalism will be replaced by [[socialism]] and eventually communism.

{{cquote|The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.|4=[[George Bernard Shaw]]}}

Many advocates of capitalism such as [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] agreed with Marx's analysis of capitalism as a process of continual change through [[creative destruction]], but, unlike Marx, believed and hoped that capitalism could essentially go on forever.

Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought—Marxism and liberalism—believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement. Marxists strongly opposed capitalism and the liberals strongly supported it, but the one concept they could both agree on was [[modernism]], a trend of thought which affirms the power of human beings to make, improve and reshape their society, with the aid of scientific knowledge, technology and practical experimentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13364">'''Psychobiography''' aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as [[artist]]s or [[political leader]]s, through the application of [[psychological theory]] and research.

Through its merging of [[personality psychology]] and historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality'' (2009) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic [[case study]]: it represents a growing field in the realm of [[biography]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson, ''Biography'' (2007)   p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; '''Psychopathography''' is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, "path" coming from ''pathos'' (πάθος)—Ancient Greek for suffering or illness. 

==Background==

Psychobiography is a field within the realms of [[psychology]] and [[biography]] that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by [[applied psychology|applying psychological]] theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Saddam Hussein]]. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person's lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. [[Henry Murray]]'s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of [[World War II]]. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Henry. "The Analysis of The Personality of Adolph Hitler." The Analysis of The personality of Adolph Hitler (1943). N.p., n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s analysis of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (titled ''[[Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood]]'') is generally considered the first "modern" psychobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]].'' New York: First DaCapo Press Edition, (1993) (orig. pub. 1977). {{ISBN|0-306-80514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;G, R, Elton, ''The Practice of History'' (1969) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger.  ''Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography'' Granta Books, London, (2002); Vienna, (2000); New York (2002) {{ISBN|0-393-05008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun/H. F. Graff, ''The Modern Researcher'' (1977) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Major psychobiographical authors include [[Erik Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carducci, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[James William Anderson]], [[Henry Murray]], [[George Atwood]], and [[William Runyan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Many psychobiographies are [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] or [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, [[script theory]], [[Object relations theory|object relations]], and [[existentialism]]/[[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Elms, ''Uncovering Lives'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were other psychobiographies written before [[Freud]]'s ''Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood'' in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about [[William Shakespeare]] (Jones, 1910), [[Giovanni Segantini]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Richard Wagner]] (Graf, 1911), [[Amenhotep IV]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Martin Luther]] (Smith, 1913), and [[Socrates]] (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;Runyan, W., M. (1988). Progress in psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 295-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of [[Margaret Fuller]] (Anthony, 1920), [[Samuel Adams]] (Harlow, 1923), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (Krutch, 1926), and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s [[Tolstoy]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Molière]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Nietzsche]], Poe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Caesar]], Lincoln, [[Napoleon]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and [[Alexander the Great]] were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of [[Adolf Hitler]], predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of [[Henry James]] (Edel, 1953–72), [[Isaac Newton]] (Manuel, 1968), [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (Erikson, 1969), [[Max Weber]] (Mitzman, 1969), [[Emily Dickinson]] (Cody, 1971), [[Joseph Stalin]] (Tucker, 1973), [[James Mill|James]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] ([[Bruce Mazlish|Mazlish]], 1975), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), [[Beethoven]] (Solomon, 1977), [[Samuel Johnson]] (Bate, 1977), [[Alice James]] (Strouse, 1980), [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Sharaf, 1983), and [[William James]] (Feinstein, 1984).&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, W., T. (2005). Handbook of psychobiography. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical perspective]]. Apart from psychoanalysts and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, [[political science|political scientists]], [[personality psychology|personality psychologists]], literary critics, [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] that have contributed to the growth of the field.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of [[psychology]] due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to [[evolutionary psychology]], [[archeology]], and [[historical geology]], offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study.  Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant [[metaphor]]s or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==

===Sigmund Freud===

Freud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, [[psychotherapy]], and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including [[Freudian slip|slips]] and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, I., E. (1988). Personality, psychological assessment, and psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elms===

Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on [[Gordon Allport|Allport]] (1972), Freud (1980), [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1981), and [[Henry Murray|Murray]] (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in ''Psychobiography and Case Study Methods'' and ''Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology'' defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (2007). Psychobiography and case study methods. In R. W. Robins, R. C. Fraley, &amp; R. F. Krueger (Eds.), The Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology. New York: Guilford Press, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (1994). Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. Paperback reprint, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt; crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as "originology"—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts,&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;—is considered easy to write.  [[Anna Freud]] condemned the study of [[Woodrow Wilson]] Freud himself co-authored with [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]] on just such grounds,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 559 and 776&lt;/ref&gt; and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[historic preservation]], '''sustainable preservation''' is the idea that preservation has tangible ecological benefits, on the basis that the most sustainable building is one that is already built. Historic buildings can have advantages over new construction with their often central location, historic building materials, and unique characteristics of craftsmanship. Arguing for these connections is at least partially an outgrowth of the green building movement with its emphasis on new construction. Sustainable preservation borrows many of the same principles of [[sustainable architecture]], though is unique by focusing on older buildings versus new construction.  The term "sustainable preservation" is also utilized to refer to the preservation of global heritage, archaeological and historic sites through the creation of economically sustainable businesses which support such preservation, such as the   [[Sustainable Preservation Initiative]] and the [[Global Heritage Fund]].

== History ==
The [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) has popularized sustainability initiatives since their founding in 1993. Their LEED certification allowed professionals to develop expertise in the field of green building. The LEED Green Building Rating System with benchmarks was established in 2000.

The [[Association for Preservation Technology International]] formed a "Sustainable Preservation Committee" in 2004 to provide an arena for discussion, and educate on the relationship between historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apti.org/about/technical.cfm#A5A|date=2009-05-31|title=Technical Committees|work=Association for Preservation Technology International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among early discussions were a workshop in Halfax, held in 2005. This was followed a workshop on "Greenbuild &amp; LEED for Historic Building" in November 2006. The APTI annual conference in Montreal from October 22–26, 2008, also included a symposium on sustainable heritage conservation. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation also included Sustainability among several issues the Trust works on. The Trust's position statement on sustainability is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/sustainability/|date=2009-05-31|title=Historic Preservation &amp; Sustainability|work=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Historic preservation can – and should – be an important component of any effort to promote sustainable development. The conservation and improvement of our existing built resources, including re-use of historic and older buildings, greening the existing building stock, and reinvestment in older and historic communities, is crucial to combating [[climate change]].

National Trust President Richard Moe, addressed the USGBC on November 20, 2008. His speech laid out several principles in an effort to find common ground:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/issues/sustainability/sustainability-preservation-1.html|date=2009-05-31|title=Sustainability Speeches|work=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Promote a culture of reuse
# Reinvest at a Community Scale
# Value the Lessons of Heritage Buildings and Communities 
# Make Use of the Economic Advantages of Reuse, Reinvestment and Retrofits
# Re-imagine Historic Preservation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Sustainability
# Take Immediate and Decisive Action

[[The Kresge Foundation]] led a Green Building Initiative from 2003 to May 29, 2009. The initiative provided planning grants for nonprofit organizations that went on to build green buildings. The foundation also demonstrated their commitment to sustainability initiatives through construction of a green headquarters in Troy, Michigan. This building incorporated a historic building on the site with new construction. These facilities were completed in 2006, and in 2008 received the Platinum-level rating from the USGBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kresge.org/index.php/headquarters/index/|date=2009-05-31|title=Our Green Headquarters|work=The Kresge Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Arab Awakening''''' is a 1938 book by [[George Antonius]], published in London by [[Hamish Hamilton]]. It is viewed as the foundational textbook of the history of modern [[Arab nationalism]]. According to [[Martin Kramer]], ''The Arab Awakening'' "became the preferred textbook for successive generations of British and American historians and their students".&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Martin (1996). [http://www.martinkramer.org/sandbox/reader/archives/ambition-arabism-and-george-antonius/ "Ambition, Arabism, and George Antonius"] in ''Arab Awakening and Islamic Revival: The Politics of Ideas in the Middle East'', ed. Martin Kramer (New Brunswick: Transaction, 1996), 112–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

It generated an ongoing debate over such issues as the origins of Arab nationalism, the significance of the [[Arab Revolt]] of 1916, and the machinations behind the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|post-World War I political settlement in the Middle East]].

==Analysis==
Antonius traced Arab nationalism to the reign of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] in [[Egypt]].  He argued that the Arab nation (which consists of racial and cultural-linguistic elements) was "dormant" for centuries, and that institutions established by [[Protestant]] [[Christian missionary|missionaries]] and educators from the [[United States]] had a specific role in the renewal and "awakening" of [[Arabic]] as a national language.  He saw the role of the [[American University of Beirut]] (originally the Syrian Protestant College) as central to this development, although he noted that by the end of the 19th century that role had diminished because the college initiated instruction in English. According to Antonius, American missionaries, educators and institutions played a critical role in the development of American [[soft power]] during the [[Edwardian era]] and after [[World War I]].

By the end of the 19th century, the torch of Arab nationalism had been passed to Arab intellectuals (residing in [[Greater Syria]] and in Europe) and to Arab officers in the [[Ottoman Army (1861-1922)|Ottoman Army]] that formed a [[secret society]] to ultimately promote Arab nationalist interests. These officers proved particularly useful during World War I after the leadership of the movement openly shifted allegiance to support the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. Other than tracing the birth of the Arab national movement, Antonius also argues that it was [[British Empire|Britain]] that dishonoured its prior commitments to the Arabs, and instead pursued its own colonial interests at the expense of what Antonius calls the "true will of the people," namely unity and independence of the would-be Arab state.

The book was only the second time that an authoritative translation of the [[McMahon letters]] had been published. This correspondence between the [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|British High Commissioner]] in [[Egypt]] and the [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sherif of Mecca]] occurred between October 1915 and January 1916 and was not officially released until the [[London Conference (1939)|1939 London Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Sykes (author)|Sykes, Christopher]] (1965) ''Cross Roads to Israel: Palestine from Balfour to Bevin.'' New English Library Edition (pb) 1967. p.205. An accurate translation had been printed in Antonius' "The Arab Awaking", 1938, as well as extracts in the Daily Mail in 1922&lt;/ref&gt; Antonius concluded that [[Sherif Hussein]] understood these documents to mean that the British government was offering him an independent state if he [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|joined the British in the war]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This state would include [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It was with these assurances that, on June 10, 1916, the Sherif ordered his army to [[Battle of Mecca (1916)|attack the garrison in Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aharon Cohen|Cohen, Aharon]] (1970) ''Israel and the Arab World''. W.H. Allen. {{ISBN|0-491-00003-0}}. pp.135,136&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15496">{{About|the Knoxville, Tennessee television series|other works with similar names|Heartland (disambiguation)}}
'''''The Heartland Series''''' is a series of [[television program]]s about the culture of [[Appalachia]], produced by [[WBIR-TV]] of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], over the 25-year period 1984 through 2009. The series has been produced on a limited basis since 2010.

==Production history==
''The Heartland Series'' was conceived in 1984 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] with a special series celebrating the people and land of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Actor [[Bill Landry]] was hired to host the series. He had previously been a teacher, had written and begun performing a one-man [[Play (theater)|play]] based on the life of [[Albert Einstein]] called "Einstein the Man," and had portrayed a fictional [[Tennessee River]] boat captain named "Captain Nat" as part of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) exhibit at the [[1982 World's Fair]] in Knoxville. Following the fair, he had continued to play the role of Captain Nat on a months-long [[barge]] tour of the Tennessee, [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]], and [[Mississippi River]]s that TVA conducted for its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutLandry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tva.gov/heritage/worldsfair/index.htm When the World Came to TVA], Tennessee Valley Authority website, accessed October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV series was initially scheduled to run for just three months.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;Leean Tupper, [http://www.oakridger.com/localnews/x2121669764/Goodbye-Heartland-Series-melded-the-generations Goodbye: 'Heartland Series' melded the generations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025646/http://www.oakridger.com/localnews/x2121669764/Goodbye-Heartland-Series-melded-the-generations |date=2011-09-28 }}, ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', August 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to Landry, the original concept, formed by WBIR creative services director Steve Dean and station general manager Jim Hart, was "to take a [[video camera|camera]] and interview the last remnants of the old mountain people and go on location.”&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; Each episode was three minutes and 40 seconds long,&lt;ref name=Shearer/&gt; designed to air in five-minute time slots during and after daily news broadcasts.

The series continued past the short run that was originally planned. Subject matter included [[geology]], wildlife, native plants, [[invasive species]], and other aspects of the region's [[natural history]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lifeways and [[archeology]], re-enactments and remembrances of historical events ranging from events in the [[American Revolutionary War]] to [[coal mining]] disasters and the early years of TVA, and feature stories about regional culture.&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/knx/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/wbir_stops_prod.shtml WBIR stops production of 'The Heartland Series'], Tele-Buddy's Tinseltown Tales, knoxnews.com, February 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his work on the series, host Bill Landry told an interviewer that he had learned to “[[Tanning (leather)|tan hides]], make jelly butter, saw logs, eat tree bark, carve [[soapstone]], build a [[log cabin]], cut timber, run a [[sawmill]], make [[moonshine]], [[Horseshoe|shoe a horse]], call a [[barred owl|hoot owl]], [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] like a [[deer]] and know when the [[American bison|buffalo]] runs.”&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; Traditional music was a perennial topic, including performances by and interviews with traditional musicians active in East Tennessee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=3&amp;StoryID=31 A Music Tale], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=1 Hardware Pickers], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrations by craftsmen who make musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=6&amp;StoryID=15 Artist in Residence - Fiddle Making], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and exploration of musical traditions such as [[old harp singing]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=2&amp;StoryID=17 Singing the Old Harp], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish and Irish influences on the region's music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=7&amp;StoryID=10 Ballads in Time], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two topics that the series generally avoided were [[politics]] and controversial religious practices such as [[snake handling]].&lt;ref name=Smyser&gt;Dick Smyser, Short takes and tall tales from Bill Landry's 'Heartland', ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', November 10, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Smokies national park, on-scene production locations in East Tennessee included the [[Museum of Appalachia]], where several episodes were taped, including the titles "1791," "Just Another Day," "The Music Tale," "The Toggins," "Frontier Music, Frontier Foods," and "Gift for Jacob,"&lt;ref name=Tupper/&gt; [[Rugby, Tennessee|Rugby]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=4&amp;StoryID=25 The Glory of Rugby], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roan Mountain State Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=28 Roan Mountain Pilgrimage], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Savage Gulf State Natural Area]] in [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=4 Wilderness Spared], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/hlstory.aspx?VolID=5&amp;StoryID=2 Hensley], Heartland episode description, WBIR-TV website, accessed October 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Landry's skill as an [[interview]]er has been remarked upon by many observers. His folksy, rambling style made him effective at putting people at ease and drawing out the interesting stories of the people that he encountered in the "hills, hollows, small towns and major cities" of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smyser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venable/&gt;

In 1998, the series was expanded to include a 30-minute version airing each Saturday at 7:00 p.m., while it continued to run the original five-minute version during the morning news, after ''10 News at Noon'', and after ''10 News Nightbeat''.&lt;ref name=AboutLandry&gt;[http://staging.wbir.com/life/programming/local/heartland/b_landry.aspx About Bill Landry], WBIR website, accessed October 6, 1009&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, about 1,900 short episodes and 150 half-hour programs were produced in the show's 25-year history.&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping&gt;Fred Brown, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/apr/13/landry-concludes-25-years-sheartland-series/ 'Heartland Series' wrapping up after 25 years], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', April 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Landry was host and narrator for the entire series.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; He also served as co-producer and wrote and directed many episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridger.com/community/x1588597869/Heartlands-Bill-Landry-speaks-at-Arboretum-Society-meeting Heartland's Bill Landry speaks at Arboretum Society meeting], ''[[The Oak Ridger]]'', October 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Dean was executive producer for 20 years, and Doug Mills was cameraman for all but one of the episodes.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesNews&gt;[http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=3759185 'Heartland Series' creator to speak at J.

The series has been successful with audiences, sometimes achieving [[Audience measurement|audience ratings]] of 7.0 or higher.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; In addition to being broadcast on WBIR, the series appeared on [[WTVC]] in [[Chattanooga]] during the 1980s and was shown on the [[Travel Channel]] (under the title ''Appalachian Stories'') for six years.&lt;ref name=Shearer&gt;John Shearer, [http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_156006.asp Former Chattanoogan Landry Had 25-Year Run With Popular Appalachian Features], The Chattanoogan,  August 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesNews/&gt;

In February 2009, WBIR announced plans to suspend production of the series in September 2009 after taking it "through to some sort of conclusion."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; WBIR general manager Jeff Lee cited economics as the reason for ending production, noting "it is a luxury for three people to produce 3-1/2 minutes of TV a week."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brownwrapping/&gt; He said that the station would continue to show the hundreds of episodes already produced "for as long as the viewers like them."&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; More than 3,000 people signed an online [[petition]] asking for the series to be continued, but WBIR followed through with its plan to end it.&lt;ref name=Morrowprime/&gt; The last episode was taped at the [[Museum of Appalachia]] in [[Norris, Tennessee|Norris]] on August 8, 2009 before an audience estimated at 10,000 people, one of the largest crowds in the museum's history.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowfans&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml 10,000 fans turn out for last 'Heartland Series' taping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019224041/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/08/10000_fans_turn.shtml |date=2009-10-19 }}, Knoxnews.com, August 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; People seeking Landry's [[autograph]] waited in line for an hour.&lt;ref name=Morrowfans/&gt; The final show featured several [[Appalachian traditional music]]ians who had appeared previously in the series, including [[fiddler]] [[Danny Gammon]], [[Bobby Fulcher]], [[Tony Thomas (bluegrass musician)|Tony Thomas]] and [[Jimmy McCarroll]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Fred Brown, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/aug/09/heartland-says-goodbye/  'Heartland Series' says goodbye; Many turn out to celebrate longtime WBIR series], Knoxville News Sentinel, August 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The last episode was scheduled for broadcast as an hour-long special on September 19, 2009, but  to avoid conflict with a [[Tennessee Volunteers]] football game the broadcast was postponed and rescheduled to be shown in a [[prime time]] slot at 8:00 p.m. on October 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/wbir_sets_date.shtml WBIR sets date for 'Heartland Series' finale], KnoxNews.com, September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/09/heartland_serie.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale postponed], KnoxNews.com, September 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrowprime&gt;Terry Morrow, [http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/10/heartland_serie_1.shtml 'Heartland Series' finale to go primetime], KnoxNews.com, October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===

Public response to the cancellation of the series caused management to reconsider its demise. In 2010 producer Steve Dean was contracted to produce four more episodes, each an hour long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=116170 New Heartland Series program to air in March], WBIR-TV website, March 17, 2010.

The '''Thirty Tyrants''' ({{lang-grc|οἱ τριάκοντα τύραννοι}}, ''hoi triákonta týrannoi'') were a [[laconophilia|pro-Spartan]] [[oligarchy]] installed in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] after its defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 404 BC. Upon [[Lysander]]'s request, the Thirty were elected as a government, not just as a legislative committee.&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, Peter. ''The Thirty at Athens'' p. 50 (hardcover {{ISBN|0801414504}})&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirty Tyrants maintained power for eight months. Though brief, their reign resulted in the killing of 5% of the Athenian population, the confiscation of citizens' property, and the exile of other [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, Andrew. ''Remembering Defeat: Civil War and Civic Memory in Ancient Athens''. (hardcover {{ISBN|0-8018-6790-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt; They became known as the "Thirty Tyrants" because of their cruel and oppressive tactics. The two leading members were [[Critias]] and [[Theramenes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15–16]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rule of the Thirty==

With Spartan support, the Thirty established an interim government in Athens. The Thirty were concerned with the revision and/or erasure of democratic laws inscribed on the wall next to the [[Stoa Basileios]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Consequently, the Thirty reduced the rights of Athenian citizens in order to institute an [[oligarchic]]al regime. The Thirty appointed a council of 500 to serve the judicial functions formerly belonging to all the citizens.&lt;ref name=AC35.1&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.html Aristotle, ''Athenian Constitution'', 35.1 (350 BCE).]&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all Athenian men had their rights removed. In fact, the Thirty chose 3,000 Athenian men "to share in the government".&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, ''The Thirty at Athens''. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; These hand-selected individuals had the right to carry weapons, to have a jury trial, and to reside within city limits.&lt;ref name=Xen3.4.1&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 3.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; The list of the selected 3,000 was consistently revised.&lt;ref name=Xen3.4.1/&gt; Although little is known about these 3,000 men ‒ for a complete record was never documented ‒ it is hypothesised{{by whom|date=September 2016}} that the Thirty appointed these select few as the only men the Thirty could find who were devotedly loyal to their regime.&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, ''The Thirty at Athens''. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Athenian citizens did not support the rule of the Thirty.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Led by [[Critias]], the Thirty Tyrants presided over a reign of terror in which they executed, murdered, and exiled hundreds of Athenians, seizing their possessions afterward. Both [[Isocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] (the latter in the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenian Constitution]]'') have reported that the Thirty executed 1500 people without trial.&lt;ref&gt;Nails, Debra. The People of Plato: A Prosopography of Plato and Other Socratics. Hackett Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0872205649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AC35.1/&gt; Critias, a former pupil of [[Socrates]], has been described as "the first [[Robespierre]]"&lt;ref&gt;Stone, I.F. The Trial of Socrates. Anchor Books, reprinted edition 1989. {{ISBN|978-0385260329}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his cruelty and inhumanity; he evidently aimed to end democracy, regardless of the human cost.&lt;ref&gt;Linder, 2002, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; The Thirty removed criminals as well as many ordinary citizens whom they considered "unfriendly" to the new regime for expressing support for the democracy. One of their targets was [[Theramenes]], whom  Critias believed to be a threat to the rule of the oligarchy. Critias accused Theramenes of conspiracy and treason, and then forced him to drink [[Poison hemlock|hemlock]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 2.3.56&lt;/ref&gt;  Many wealthy citizens were executed simply so the oligarchs could confiscate their assets, which were then distributed among the Thirty and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon ''Hellenica'' 2.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; They also hired 300 "lash-bearers" or whip-bearing men to intimidate Athenian citizens.&lt;ref name=AC35.1/&gt;

The Thirty's regime did not meet with much overt opposition, although many Athenians disliked the new form of government. Those who did not approve of the new laws could either fight ‒ and risk exile or execution ‒ or accept the Thirty's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, ''The Thirty at Athens''. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of [[democracy]] chose to fight and were exiled, among them [[Thrasybulus]], a [[trierarch]] in the Athenian navy and noted supporter of democratic government. The [[Phyle Campaign|uprising that overthrew]] the Thirty in 403 BC was orchestrated by a group of exiles led by Thrasybulus. Critias was killed in the initial revolt.&lt;ref&gt;
Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 3.4.19
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The Thirty Tyrants' brief reign was marred by violence and corruption. In fact, historians have argued that the violence and brutality the Thirty carried out in Athens was necessary to transition Athens from a democracy to an oligarchy.&lt;ref name=AncientTyranny&gt;Lewis, Sian. ''Ancient Tyranny'', p. 213. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006. Print. (Hardcover, {{ISBN|0748621253}})&lt;/ref&gt; However, the violence produced an unanticipated paradox. The more violent the Thirty's regime became, the more opposition they faced.&lt;ref name=AncientTyranny/&gt; The increased level of opposition ultimately resulted in the upheaval of the Thirty's regime by Thrasybulus' rebel forces. After the revolution, Athens needed to decide the best way to govern the liberated city-state and to reconcile the atrocities committed by the Thirty. It was decided to give amnesty to all of the members of the selected 3,000, except for the Thirty themselves, the Eleven{{clarify|reason=Eleven? Ten? who? or what?|date=November 2017}}, and the ten who ruled in [[Piraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 2.4.38&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution that overthrew the Thirty Tyrants, Athens and her citizens struggled to reconcile and rebuild.

== Mention of the Thirty ==

[[Plato]], in the opening portion of his ''[[Seventh Letter]]'', recounts the rule of the Thirty Tyrants during his youth. He explains that following the revolution, fifty-one men became rulers of a new government, with a specific group of thirty in charge of the public affairs of Athens. Ten of the fifty-one were to rule the city, and eleven were sent to rule [[Piraeus]]. Plato corroborates the general consensus found in other sources: the rule of the Thirty was "reviled as it was by many". The rule of the Thirty made the former democracy resemble a golden age in comparison. Plato also includes an account of the interaction between [[Socrates]] and the Thirty.&lt;ref name=SeventhLetter&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/seventh_letter.html ''Seventh Letter of Plato'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato mentions [[Lysias]], one of the men from Athens who escaped the Thirty's reign of terror. Lysias' brother [[Polemarchus]] "fell victim to the Thirty Tyrants".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socrates and the Thirty==
Due to their desire to remain in complete control over Athens, the Thirty sought to exile or kill anyone who outwardly opposed their regime. Socrates remained in the city through this period, which caused the public to associate him with the Thirty and may have contributed to his eventual death sentence, especially since Critias had been his student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/if-stone-breaks-the-socrates-story-an-old-muckraker-sheds-fresh.html|title=I.F. Stone Breaks the Socrates Story|last=Stone|first=I.F.|date=April 8, 1979|work=The New York Times Magazine|access-date=June 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates recounts an incident in which the Thirty once ordered him (and four other men) to bring before them [[Leon of Salamis]], a man known for his justice and upright character, for execution. While the other four men obeyed, Socrates refused, not wanting to partake in the guilt of the executioners. However, he did not attempt to warn or save Leon of Salamis. By disobeying, Socrates may have been placing his own life in jeopardy, and he claimed it was only the disbanding of the oligarchy soon afterward that saved his life:

"When the oligarchy came into power, the Thirty Commissioners in their turn summoned me and four others to the Round Chamber and instructed us to go and fetch Leon of Salamis from his home for execution. This was of course only one of many instances in which they issued such instructions, their object being to implicate as many people as possible in their crimes. On this occasion, however, I again made it clear, not by my words but by my actions, that the attention I paid to death was zero (if that is not too unrefined a claim); but that I gave all my attention to avoiding doing anything unjust or unholy. Powerful as it was, that government did not terrify me into doing a wrong action. When we came out of the rotunda, the other four went to Salamis and arrested Leon, but I simply went home."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Apology'' 32c-d&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on in his ''Seventh Letter'', Plato describes the interaction between the Thirty and Socrates from his own point of view: "They tried to send a friend of mine, the aged Socrates, whom I should scarcely scruple to describe as the most upright man of that day, with some other persons to carry off one of the citizens by force to execution, in order that, whether he wished it, or not, he might share the guilt of their conduct; but he would not obey them, risking all consequences in preference to becoming a partner in their iniquitous deeds."&lt;ref name=SeventhLetter/&gt;

The Italian historian Luciano Canfora has inferred that another of Socrates' students, Xenophon, may have played an important part in the rule of the Thirty, as one of the two commanders of the cavalry, which were the Thirty's militia. Indeed, in his book ''Hipparchos'' (Commander of the cavalry), Xenophon only mentions one of the commanders (there were always two), only to revile him, but never mentions the other.&lt;ref&gt; Luciano Canfora ''Storie di Oligarchi''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Xenophon's ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' (Bk 1, Ch 2), Xenophon also reports a contentious confrontation between Socrates and the Thirty, Critias included. Socrates is summoned before the group and ordered not to instruct or speak to anyone, whereupon Socrates mocks the order by asking whether he will be allowed to ask to buy food in the marketplace. Xenophon uses the episode to illustrate both Socrates' own critique of the slaughtering of Athenian citizens by the Thirty, as well as make the case that the relationship between Critias and Socrates had significantly deteriorated by the time Critias obtained power.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
'''''Translatio studii''''' ([[Latin]] for "transfer of learning") is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] concept, originating in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=Newsom&gt;Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W. Breed, ''Daniel: A Commentary'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of knowledge or learning from one geographical place and time to another. The concept is closely linked to ''[[translatio imperii]]'', which similarly describes the movement of imperial dominance.  Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (verses 39–40).&lt;ref name=Newsom/&gt;

==History of the concept==

It is a celebrated [[Literary topos|topos]] in [[medieval literature]], most notably articulated in the prologue to [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s ''[[Cligès]]'', composed ca. 1170. There, Chrétien explains that [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] was first the seat of all knowledge, then it came to Rome, and now it has come to France, where, by the grace of God, it shall remain forever more.  

In the [[Renaissance]] and later, historians saw the metaphorical light of learning as moving much as the light of the sun did:  westward.  According to this notion, the first center of learning was [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], followed by [[Jerusalem]], and [[Babylon]].  From there, the light of learning moved westward to [[Athens]], and then west to [[Rome]].  After Rome, learning moved west to [[Paris]].  From there, enlightenment purportedly moved west to [[London]], though other nations laid claim to the mantle, most notably [[Russia]], which would involve a retrograde motion and rupture in the westerly direction.  The [[metaphor]] of ''translatio studii'' went out of fashion in the 18th century, but such English Renaissance authors as [[George Herbert]] were already predicting that learning would move next to America.  

A pessimistic corollary metaphor is the ''translatio stultitiae''.  As learning moves west, as the earth turns and light falls ever westward, so night follows and claims the places learning has departed from.  The metaphor of the ''translatio stultitiae'' informs [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Dunciad]],'' and particularly book IV of the ''Greater Dunciad'' of 1741, which opens with the [[nihilism|nihilistic]] invocation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Yet, yet a moment, one dim Ray of Light
Indulge, dread Chaos, and eternal Night!" (''B'' IV 1-2)

[...]

Suspend a while your Force inertly strong,
Then take at once the Poet, and the Song. (ibid. 7-8)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology==

While the term ''translatio studii'' literally means in English the translation of studies, there is an implication within the concept that the transmission of learning also carried with it cultural ideals and information. That being said, there is a lot more to ''translatio studii'' than the simple movement of common concepts from the Mediterranean westward.

According to Karlheinz Stierle, English is what we might consider the current language of this sort of transmission, but "what English is today...Latin was in the first centuries after Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Stierle, Karlheinz. "Translatio Studii and Renaissance: From Vertical to Horizontal Translation." ''The Translatability of Cultures: Figures of the Space Between''. Budick, Sanford and Iser, Wolfgang. Stanford UP, 1996. 56. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In the way that politics and social issues move circulate around the world very often in English, these same concepts traveled along the developing roads from Greece and Italy to England during Medieval times. As religion spread from Rome to [[Londinium]] (or present day Britain) it brought with it other concepts that can still be seen in the Romance languages.

An interesting example of this is the term "translatio" itself. In Ancient times ''translatio'' in Latin meant both ''translation'' and ''transfer''. As time went on, ''translatio'' was designated to only mean transmission and ''traductio'' took on the meaning of what we know as translation. This carried over to the developing Romance languages as time went on. The words ''translation'' in French and ''traslazione'' in Italian mean the displacement of physical objects, and these languages still use other words to mean "translation" in the English sense.&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz, Stierle. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This varies remarkably from the common meaning used in English, which is solely a linguistic concept rather than a spatial one.  In this way, it is clear that historically the significance of ''translatio studii'' concerns the transfer of ideas that hold cultural value.

==''Translatio imperii''==

''[[Translatio imperii]]'' often served as a precedent or coordinate to ''translatio studii''.  A transferral of rule assisted a transferral of culture, and vice versa: "The transferal of power also conveys the phoenix-like reestablishment of culture - as fictionalized in and transmitted by literature - which establishes each new imperial power as the new stronghold of the culturally elite."&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, Sunhee Kim. "Translatio studii et imperii: Sir Gawain as literary critic." Semiotica, Volume 63, Issue 1-2. (2009): 185-204. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is concerned with the progress of learning, ''translatio studii'' provides an overview of intellectual heritage.  Although it may be considered from various angles (e.g., history, linguistics, and literature) the concept of ''translatio studii'' is fundamentally concerned with texts.  "Reading, translating, commenting, interpreting, rewriting — all are common intertextual activities of the ''translatio studii''."&lt;ref&gt;Carron, Jean-Claude. "Imitation and Intertextuality in the Renaissance." New Literary History, Volume 19, No. 3. (1988): 565-579. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Translatio studii'' is based on the assumption that human learning and the potential for human learning originated in [[Greece]] from whence it spread westward to [[Rome]] and then [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothstein, Marian. "Etymology, Genealogy, and the Immutability of Origins." Renaissance Quarterly, Volume 43, No.2. (1990): 332-347. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chrétien de Troyes]], a French poet of the late 12th century, writes of ''translatio studii'' in the opening of [[Cligès]]:

&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Par les livres que nous avons''
''Les fez des anciiens savons''
''Et del siecle qui fu jadis.''
''Ce nos ont nostre livre apris,''
''Que Grece ot de chevalerie''
''Le premier los et de clergie.''
''Puis vint chevalerie a Rome''
''Et de la clergie la some,''
''Qui or est en France venue.''
''Deus doint qu'ele i soit retenue''
''Et que li leus li abelisse''
''Tant que ja mes de France n'isse.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That is: "Through the books which we have, we know the deeds of the ancients and of times long passed.  Our books have taught us that Greece had the first fame of chivalry and learning.  Then came chivalry to Rome, and the sum of learning, which now is come to France.  God grant that it remain there, and that it find the place so pleasant that it will never depart from France."&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, Ernst Robert. European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages. "Princeton University Press." Princeton, New Jersey. 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece to Rome: theatre==

All Roman comedy stems from Greek New Comedy but rewritten in Latin with slight adjustments to local taste and the long, narrow stage of Roman theatre. It keeps the characteristics of conventional situations from domestic life and stock character-masks that were traditional in the Greek model.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Jennifer, and Craig S. Walker, eds. The Broadview Anthology of Drama: Plays from the Western Theatre. Vol. 1. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman theatre in turn influenced theatre of the [[Renaissance]]. "The nine Greek-style tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (c. 4 B.C.E. -65 C.E.) are especially noteworthy, partly because they were to have a more profound influence on Renaissance tragedians than their Greek originals." Conventions commonly associated with Renaissance tragedies, most popularly [[Shakespeare]], that are owed to Seneca, are revenge tragedies, structure of five acts, use of elaborate speeches, soliloquies, and asides, violence and horror performed on stage (as opposed to Greek tragedies in which all such actions occurred off stage), and an interest in the human condition, morality of nobility, and the supernatural, specifically with its human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Jennifer, and Craig S. Walker, eds. The Broadview Anthology of Drama: Plays from the Western Theatre. Vol. 1. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome also used the Greek language as a model on which to aid the expansion of their power and secure a language for their empire. According to L. G. Kelly, author of ''The True Interpreter: A History of Translation Theory and Practice in the West'' (1979), "Western Europe owes its civilization to its translators."&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, and Spawforth, eds. "Translation." The Oxford Classical Dictionary. 3rd ed. 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglo-Norman: ''cortoisie'' and ''romanz''==

''Cortoisie'' is a synthesis of the superiority of French knighthood and learning. As a new distinction of the French knight, ''cortoisie'' implies not only a new style of communication and mastery of language, but a new style of communicative attitude, especially when regarding women. From ''cortoisie'' comes courtly love, a highly disciplined, self-denying, and respectful social form. Ideally, in this form, the knight honors his lady as something sacred. This new ideal of love called for a new ideal of language, according to Chrétien, and so, translations from old, dead Latin into French, or ''romanz'', began. It is this language that replaces Latin as a new and lasting period of high culture, and, in so doing, becomes the real language or medium of ''translatio studii''.&lt;ref&gt;Budick, Sanford, and Wolfgang Isen, eds. The Translatability of Cultures: Figurations of the Space Between. Stanford: Stanford UP, 1996. Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Factor''' is a view of modern history that promotes the United States as the contingent reason for the Allied Powers winning both [[World War]]s and for preventing any powerful rival political regime from becoming mainstream in the 21st century world.

== Background ==

[[Azar Gat]], argues that this "United States Factor" is both widely overlooked and the reason for democracy's victory over totalitarianism in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gat2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War in Human Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=565–567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United States Factor notion, "if it were not for the existence of the USA the liberal democracies would most probably have lost the great struggles of the twentieth century."&lt;ref name="Gat2006" /&gt;

== United States Factor in History ==

The 20th century did appear to witness what many theorists have seen as the end of the battles of political ideology, with the political model of [[liberal democracy]] coming out on top. Indeed, [[political scientist]]s, including [[Francis Fukuyama]], hailed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] as the "end of history" in which the ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy [becomes] the final form of human government." (See [[End of History and the Last Man]])

In the view of the United States Factor, this "end of history" is made possible only because the USA was in a unique space economically, geographically, politically, and militarily throughout the 20th century that made it possible for the United States to "rescue" the [[Old World]] powers from the threat of [[totalitarianism]]. These menaces included both right wing totalitarian regimes, such as [[Nazism]], as well as left wing totalitarianism—better known as Soviet-era Communism. (See [[State ideology of the Soviet Union]])

Though Gat acknowledges that the victory of democracy over totalitarianism was not necessarily "preordained" at the outset of either World War, he goes on to remark that the sheer fact that the USA existed gave liberal democracies their "edge" in the battle against totalitarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Gat2006" /&gt; This was achieved mainly by the USA's contributions to the European Allies' war efforts from a distant location that was geographically large and politically united.&lt;ref name="Gat2006" /&gt;

== American Exceptionalism ==

This is a view of modern history that fits within the political theory of [[American exceptionalism]]. American exceoptionalism, as defined by Jentleson, is a theory that holds that the United States possesses an inherent uniqueness and "special virtue" that is rooted in American principles and can be traced throughout American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jentleson|first=Bruce|title=American Foreign Policy: The Dynamics of Choice in the 21st Century|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-393-93357-4|pages=90–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the United States is exceptional, or extraordinary, simply because it is the United States is a political philosophy that has been in existence for several decades and is a leading contributor to contemporary American political culture. (See [[Politics of the United States]])

== Competing Views ==

There are many other ideas as to the behaviors of states and how they react and interact in the world. Such views that provide alternate theories to American exceptionalism and the United States Factor include [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], [[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], and [[idealism]], just to name a few. These are some of the popular theories used in today's discussions about International Relations. They put emphasis on states' behaviors and how to forecast potential outcomes of the entire spectrum of international affairs, from militarized conflict to diplomacy.

The '''Wakker Prize''' (in German: ''Wakkerpreis'', in French ''Prix Wakker'', in Italian ''Premio Wakker'') is awarded annually by the [[Swiss Heritage Society]] to a [[Municipality of Switzerland]] for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage.

At the beginning, the prize honoured municipalities which did special needs for preservation of the old towns. Recently,{{When|date=January 2015}} the prize also honours municipalities that develop their townscapes on a specific leading point. This might be an estimated use of an old industrial facility or a successful combination between old and new basic structure of a building.

In 2005, the prize was given to the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], rather than a municipality, because of the jubilee of the Swiss Heritage Society.

The prize is named for [[Henri-Louis Wakker]].

==Criteria==
To get this prize, municipalities have to follow the named criteria:
* A visible, qualitative development and upgrading of townscape in a contemporary manner.
* To be respectful towards with old settlement pattern.
* An active input for above-average architectural quality, due to a good example of the municipality.
* The current place-planning prefers the development of the prize.
* At the end are following issues important for the overall assessment, protection of the area, sustainability, traffic planning and residential quality.

'''White gods''' is the belief that [[ancient]] [[cultures]] around the world were visited by [[Caucasian race]]s in ancient times, and that they were known as "White gods".

Based on 16th-century accounts of the Spanish [[conquistadors]] being "greeted as gods" by the peoples of the [[New World]], certain modern authors have expanded the concept beyond what is historically verifiable, spreading it to the genre of [[pseudoarchaeological]] literature and [[fringe theory|fringe theorists]], such as writers on [[ancient astronaut]]s or [[Atlantis]], in some instances (such as [[Christian Identity]]) even acquiring quasi-religious or racialist ([[white supremacist]]) connotations.

[[File:Quetzalcoatl magliabechiano.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Quetzalcoatl as depicted in the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]
Some [[authors]] have claimed that white missionaries or "gods" visited [[Americas|America]] before [[Christopher Columbus]]. Authors usually quote from [[mythology]] and [[legend]]s which discuss ancient gods such as [[Quetzalcoatl]] to conclude that the legends were actually based on [[White people|Caucasians]] visiting those areas, and that the Caucasians were really the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0osWcOoQGf4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=white+gods&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gpb3TYikLtCt8QOVnvjKCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20gods&amp;f=false |title=Myths of Pre-Columbian America – Donald A.

[[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[chroniclers]] from the 16th century claimed that when the [[conquistadors]] led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] first encountered the Incas they were greeted as gods, "Viracochas", because their lighter skin resembled their god named [[Viracocha]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Spanish America: a documentary history'', Kenneth R. Mills, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This story was first reported by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] (1553) and later by [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]]. Similar accounts by Spanish chroniclers (e.g. [[Juan de Betanzos]]) describe Viracocha as a "White God", often with a beard.&lt;ref&gt;''Pre-Columbian America: Myths and Legends'', Donald. A. Mackenzie, Senate, 1996, p.268-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Rupert Furneaux also linked "White gods" to the ancient city of [[Tiahuanaco]].&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Furneaux, Ancient Mysteries, Ballantine Books, 1987, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel A. Braghine in his 1940 book ''The Shadow of Atlantis'' claimed that the [[Kalina people|Carib people]] have reports and legends of a white bearded man whom they called ''Tamu'' or ''Zune'' who had come from the East, taught the people [[agriculture]] and later disappeared in an "easterly direction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aqoUiUp3u8C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=colonel+braghine+zukha&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k8L3Ta_vDcKy8QOwuomrCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Shadow of Atlantis 1940 – A. Braghine – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Braghine also claimed [[Manco Cápac]] was a white bearded man.&lt;ref&gt;Braghine, The Shadow of Atlantis, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlantis]] author [[Gerd von Hassler]] linked the "White gods" to the [[biblical flood]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Von Hassler, Lost Survivors of the Deluge, 1980 pp. 63 – 81 {{ISBN|0-451-08365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[archaeologist]] Pierre Honoré in 1962 proposed the [[fringe theory]] that the pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations were due to "white men from the vicinity of Crete".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Honoré, ''In quest of the white god: the mysterious heritage of South American civilization'',  Futura Publications (1962). In  2007, the book was reprinted as ''In Search of Quetzalcoatl: The Mysterious Heritage of American Civilization''. The 2007 edition can be found online  [https://books.google.com/books?id=mNv4ofH2Mk8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pierre+Honor%C3%A9&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hpz3TcXcMIe38gORoJTHCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false at google books].&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Robert F. Marx]] has written extensively about the concept of "White gods". Marx came to the conclusion that white gods "figure in almost every indigenous culture in the Americas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Kirsch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-22/news/vw-383_1_great-white-god |title=BOOK REVIEW : Memoir Masquerades as History in 'Quest of Great White Gods' : IN QUEST OF THE GREAT WHITE GODS, Contact Between the Old and New World From the Dawn of History by Robert F.

The [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Harold T. Wilkins]] took the concept of the white gods the furthest, writing that a vanished white race had occupied the whole of [[South America]] in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;The Pan American, Volume 7, Famous Features Syndicate, 1946, p. 11 "Harold T. Wilkins Legend of a Fabulous Empire" discusses Wilkins belief about a "strange white race living in lost cities, amidst the crumbling ruins of once splendid palaces and temples in South America"&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins also claimed that [[Quetzalcoatl]] was from [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh1WHqo0JN8C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=white+gods+harold+wilkins&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKb3TbGGGIfA8QOPxeWyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Lost Cities of North &amp; Central America – David Hatcher Childress – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDTUF3wHlkoC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=white+gods+harold+wilkins&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5qj3TbLCCYbF8QPB65TeCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mysteries of Ancient South America – Harold T.

The [[occultist]] [[James H. Madole]], influenced by [[Aryanism]] and [[Hinduism]], wrote that the [[Aryan race]] was of great antiquity and had been worshipped worldwide by lower races as "white gods". Madole also wrote that the Aryans originated in the [[Garden of Eden]] located in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, 2003 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars consider the "White God legends" to be a post-conquest Spanish invention and that the ideas are based on [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: encyclopedia of Pseudoscience'', "white god legends", Michael Shermer, ABC-CLIO, 2002, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormonism==

Some [[Mormon]]s believe that [[Quetzalcoatl]], a figure described as white and bearded, who came from the sky and promised to return, was likely [[Jesus Christ]]. According to the scriptural account recorded in the [[Book of Mormon]], Jesus Christ visited and taught natives of the Americas following his resurrection, and regarded them as the "other sheep" whom he had referenced during his mortal ministry. The Book of Mormon also claims that Jesus Christ appeared to others, following his resurrection, even to the inhabitants on the "isles of the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=11&amp;num=1&amp;id=298 |author= Wirth, Diane E. |date= 2002 |title= Quetzalcoatl, the Maya maize god and Jesus Christ |journal= Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 4–15 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the Mexican legend, [[LDS Church]] [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Taylor, John |author-link= John Taylor (Mormon) |date= 1892 |origyear= 1882 |title= An Examination into and an Elucidation of the Great Principle of the Mediation and Atonement of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ |publisher= [[Deseret News]] |page= 201 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QmQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This idea was adapted by Mormon science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]] in his story ''[[America (short story)|America]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Ancient astronauts==
Some [[Ancient astronaut]] and [[UFO]] writers have claimed the "white gods" were actually [[extraterrestrials]]. [[Peter Kolosimo]] believed that the legends of [[Quetzalcoatl]] had a basis in fact.  He claimed that the legends actually describe a race of white men who were born in spaceships and migrated to [[Atlantis]]; then, after Atlantis was destroyed, they moved to the [[Americas]] to be treated as "white gods" by the "primitive earth-dwellers".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolosimo, Timeless Earth, 1977 pp. 153 – 154 {{ISBN|0-7221-5329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
