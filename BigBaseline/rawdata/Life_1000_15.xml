'''aaajiao''' （aka.Xu Wenkai） ({{zh|c= 徐文恺}}), is the online handle of Xu Wenkai,  a Shanghai- and Berlin-based artist, avid blogger and free thinker.

Born in 1984, aaajiao grew up in Xi’an, the ancient capital of Qin and Han Dynasty known for the Terracotta Army. The year of 1984, coinciding with [[George Orwell]]’s dystopian masterpiece, seems to explain the perfect alignment between the vivid SciTech-driven imagination and the sometimes-poetic sophistication, frequently seen as the main theme of aaajiao’s work. Many of aaajiao’s works tap into the most current trends of thoughts around the Internet sphere, with a focus on the emerging controversies and phenomenon related to data processing, blogsphere/wemedia and filtered information. In his most recent projects, the artist has adopted a more extended scope of practices, borrowing elements from architecture, electronic music, performance arts, product design, even medicine, to portray the young generation harnessing the power of cyber technology and the ever-present social media.

Being one of the most frequently exhibited Chinese new media artists, aaajiao has been featured in both international and domestic scenes. Highlights include: “Global Control And Censorship - [[ZKM]] | Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe(2015)”, The 2nd “CAFAM Future” Exhibition: Observer-Creator · The Reality Representation of Chinese Young Art Beijing, CAFA Art Museum (2015); Cosmos - Limited and Limitless, Existence and Co-existence Shanghai, 21st Century Minsheng Art Museum (2014),Thingworld - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2014),The West Bund Architecture and Contemporary Art Biennale, Shanghai (2013); “One World” Exposition – Chinese Art in the Age of the New Media, Videotage, TransLife: Media Art China 2011 - International Triennial of New Media Art Beijing,The [[National Art Museum of China]] (2011),Hong Kong (2011); [[Transmediale]], Berlin (2010), etc. aaajiao is a winner of the Jury Prize from Art Sanya Awards 2014, a nominee of OCAT – Pierre Huber Art Prize, and most recently, a nominee of the “Young Artist of the Year” of 9th “Award of Art China”.

An '''alternative lifestyle''' is a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] diverse in respect to [[mainstream]] ones, or generally perceived to be outside the cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]. ''Lifestyle'' is a [[media culture]] term derived from the concept of [[style in art]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. ''Introduction'', in [[Adorno]] ''[[Culture industry]]'' p.35 quotation: {{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and ‘different’ commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative ‘life-styles’.&lt;br&gt;
‘Life-styles’, the culture industry’s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, but not always, it implies an affinity or identification within some matching [[subculture]] (e.g. [[hippies]], [[Goth subculture|goths]] and [[Punk subculture|punks]]). Some people with alternative lifestyles mix elements from various subcultures ([[grunge]] musicians were often influenced by a mixture of the [[punk subculture|punk]], [[acid rock|hippie]], [[emo]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subcultures).

Not all minority lifestyles are held{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to be "alternative", so the term tends to apply to newer forms of lifestyle, often based upon enlarged freedoms (especially in the sphere of social styles), or a decision to substitute another approach, or to not follow the usual expected path in most societies.

== History ==
Alternative lifestyles and subcultures originated in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=f5rLCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=the+flapper+women&amp;ots=kv9L6jn-h-&amp;sig=8djPjwlb-1GHEYp_SKWp-gpfLsE#v=snippet&amp;q=flapper&amp;f=false|title=Modern women on trial: Sexual transgression in the age of the flapper|last=Bland|first=Lucy|date=2013-09-30|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781847798961|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} with the "[[flapper]]" movement, when women cut their hair and skirts short (as a symbol of freedom from oppression and the old way of living). Women in the flapper age were the first large group of females to practice pre-marital sex, dancing, cursing, and driving in modern America without scandal following them.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

A [[Stanford University]] cooperative house, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160730005004/http://web.stanford.edu/group/synergy/ Synergy], was founded in 1972 with the theme of "exploring alternative lifestyles."

==Examples ==

* Living in unusual communities, such as [[commune]]s, [[Intentional community|intentional communities]], [[ecovillage]]s, [[off-the-grid]], or the [[tiny house movement]]
* Traveling [[subcultures]], including [[lifestyle traveller]]s, [[housetrucker|housetrucking]], and [[New Age travellers|New Age travelling]]
* [[Body modification]], including [[tattoos]], [[body piercings]], [[Suspension (body modification)|suspension]], and [[transdermal implants]]
* [[Nudism]] and [[clothing optional]] lifestyles
* Non-normative sexual lifestyles, such as [[BDSM]], [[polyamory]], [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]], and certain types of [[sexual fetishism]] or [[paraphilia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makai|first1=Michael|title=Domination &amp; Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|date=September 2013|publisher=Createspace|isbn=1492775975}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alternative medicine]] and natural methods of medical care or [[herbal remedies]] as medication
* Adherents to alternative [[spirituality|spiritual]] and religious practices, such as [[vampire lifestyle|vampirism]], [[Wicca]], [[Neopaganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[cults]]
* Certain religious minorities, such as the [[Amish]] who pursue a non-technological or [[anti-technology]] lifestyle

&lt;/ref&gt;
is a chemical-like system that usually consists of objects, called molecules, that interact according to rules resembling chemical reaction rules. Artificial chemistries are created and studied in order to understand fundamental properties of chemical systems, including prebiotic evolution, as well as for developing chemical computing systems. Artificial chemistry is a field within computer science wherein chemical reactions—often biochemical ones—are computer-simulated, yielding insights on evolution, self-assembly, and other biochemical phenomena. The field does not use actual chemicals, and should not be confused with either synthetic chemistry or computational chemistry. Rather, bits of information are used to represent the starting molecules, and the end products are examined along with the processes that led to them. The field originated in [[artificial life]] but has shown to be a versatile method with applications in many fields such as [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]].

==Formal definition==
An artificial chemistry is defined in general as a triple (S,R,A). In some cases it is sufficient to define it as a tuple (S,I).

*S is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of possible molecules S={s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}, where n is the number of elements in the set, possibly infinite.
*R is a set of [[arity|n-ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on the molecules in S, the reaction rules R={r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}. Each rule r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is written like a chemical reaction a+b+c-&gt;a*+b*+c*. Note here that r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are operators, as opposed to +.
*A is an [[algorithm]] describing how to apply the rules R to a [[subset]] P&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;S.
*I are the interaction rules of the molecules in S.

==Types of artificial chemistries==

* depending on the space of possible molecules
** finite
** infinite
* depending on the type of reactions
** catalytic systems
** reactive systems
** inhibitive systems
* depending on the space topology
** well stirred reactor
** topologically arranged (1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional)

==Important concepts==
* The field is heavily reliant on mathematics, to include mathematical modeling. It in fact relies more on a mathematics background than a chemistry background.
* Organizations: An organization is a set of molecules that is closed and self-maintaining. As such, it is a set that does not create anything outside itself, and such that any molecule inside the set can be generated within the set.
* Closed sets
* Self-maintaining sets
* Hasse diagram of organizations

==History of artificial chemistries==

Artificial chemistries emerged as a sub-field of [[artificial life]], in particular from [[strong artificial life]]. The idea behind this field was that if one wanted to build something alive, it had to be done by a combination of non-living entities. For instance, a cell is itself alive, and yet is a combination of non-living molecules. Artificial chemistry enlists, among others, researchers that believe in an extreme bottom-up approach to artificial life. In artificial life, bits of information were used to represent bacteria or members of a species, each of which moved, multiplied, or died in computer simulations. In artificial chemistry  bits of information are used to represent starting molecules capable of reacting with one another. The field has pertained to artificial intelligence by virtue of the fact that, over billions of years, non-living matter evolved into primordial life forms which in turn evolved into intelligent life forms.

==Important contributors==

The first reference about Artificial Chemistries come from a Technical paper written by [[John McCaskill]]
.&lt;ref&gt;J.S.McCaskill. Polymer chemistry on tape: A computational model for emergent genetics. Technical report, MPI for Biophysical Chemistry, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Fontana]] working with [[Leo Buss]] then took up the work developing the [[AlChemy model]]
&lt;ref&gt;W. Fontana. Algorithmic chemistry. In C. G. Langton, C. Taylor, J. D. Farmer, and S. Rasmussen, editors, Artificial Life II, pages 159–210. Westview Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name="FB1994"&gt;W. Fontana and L. Buss. “The arrival of the fittest”: Toward a theory of biological organization. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 56(1):1–64, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
The model was presented at the second International Conference of Artificial Life.
In his first papers he presented the concept of [[organization]], as a set of molecules that is algebraically closed and self-maintaining.
This concept was further developed by Dittrich and Speroni di Fenizio into a theory of chemical organizations
&lt;ref&gt;P. Dittrich, P. Speroni di Fenizio. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11538-006-9130-8 Chemical Organization Theory]. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (2007) 69: 1199:1231.&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;P. Speroni di Fenizio. Chemical Organization Theory. PhD thesis, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main schools of artificial chemistries have been in Japan and Germany.
In Japan the main researchers have been [[Takashi Ikegami]]
,&lt;ref&gt;T. Ikegami and T. Hashimoto. Active mutation in self-reproducing networks of machines and tapes. Artificial Life, 2(3):305–318, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;T. Ikegami and T.Hashimoto. Replication and diversity in machine-tape coevolutionary systems. In C. G. Langton and K. Shimohara, editors, Artificial Life V, pages 426–433. MIT Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hideaki Suzuki]]
&lt;ref&gt;H.Suzuki. Models for the conservation of genetic information with string-based artificial chemistry. In W. Banzhaf, J. Ziegler, T. Christaller, P. Dittrich, and J. T. Kim, editors, Advances in Artificial Life, volume 2801 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 78–88. Springer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;H. Suzuki. A network cell with molecular agents that divides from centrosome signals. Biosystems, 94(1-2):118–125, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Yasuhiro Suzuki]]

In [[Germany]], it was [[Wolfgang Banzhaf]], who, together with his students [[Peter Dittrich]] and [[Jens Ziegler]], developed various artificial chemistry models.
Their 2001 paper 'Artificial Chemistries - A Review' &lt;ref name="DZB2001" /&gt; became a standard in the field.
[[Jens Ziegler]], as part of his PhD thesis, proved that an artificial chemistry could be used to control a small Khepera robot
.&lt;ref&gt;J.Ziegler and W.Banzhaf. Evolving control metabolisms for a robot. ArtificialLife, 7(2):171–190, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other models, [[Peter Dittrich]] developed the [[Seceder model]] which is able to explain group formation in society through some simple rules. Since then he became a professor in [[Jena]] where he investigates artificial chemistries as a way to define a general theory of [[constructive dynamical system]]s.

==Applications of artificial chemistries==

Artificial Chemistries are often used in the study of protobiology, in trying to bridge the gap between [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].
A further motivation to study artificial chemistries is the interest in constructive dynamical systems. Yasuhiro Suzuki has modeled various systems such as membrane systems, signaling pathways (P53), ecosystems, and enzyme systems by using his method, abstract rewriting system on multisets (ARMS).

In [[biology]], a '''biological life cycle''' (or just '''life cycle''' when the biological context is clear) is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state.

In some organisms, different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For [[Embryophyte|plants]] and many [[algae]], there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. The term '''life history''' is often used, particularly for organisms such as the [[red algae]] which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.&lt;ref name="Dixon73"&gt;Dixon, P.S. 1973. ''Biology of the Rhodophyta.'' Oliver &amp; Boyd. {{ISBN|0 05 002485 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating [[haploid]] (''n'') and [[diploid]] (2''n'') stages, i.e., a change of [[ploidy]] is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, [[meiosis]] must occur. In regard to changes of [[ploidy]], there are 3 types of cycles:
*'''''haplontic''''' life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is "zygotic".
*'''''diplontic''''' life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid [[gamete]]s are formed, meiosis is "gametic".
*'''''haplodiplontic''''' life cycle (also referred to as ''diplohaplontic'', ''diplobiontic'', or ''dibiontic'' life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when [[mitosis]] (growth) occurs. '''Zygotic meiosis''' and '''gametic meiosis''' have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the ''n'' phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2''n'' phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed '''haplobiontic''' (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). '''Sporic meiosis''', on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed '''diplobiontic''' (not to be confused with diplontic).

==Discovery==
The study of [[reproduction]] and [[Embryogenesis|development]] in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated that [[alternation of generations]] is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see [[History of botany#Plant sexuality|plant sexuality]]).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Nils Eberhard Svedelius. 1873-1960 | author=C.

''Encyclopedia of Microbiology''. Academic Press. Volume 4, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haplontic life cycle==
[[File:Haploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Zygotic meiosis]]
A '''zygotic meiosis''' is a [[meiosis]] of a [[zygote]] immediately after [[karyogamy]], which is the fusion of two [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide [[mitotic]]ally to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are '''haplonts''', hence this life cycle is also called '''haplontic life cycle'''. Haplonts are:

Cambridge University Press (623 pp).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Gametic meiosis]]

In '''gametic meiosis''', instead of immediately dividing ''meiotically'' to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides ''mitotically'' to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or [[gamete]]s. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a '''diplont''', hence a gametic meiosis is also called a '''diplontic life cycle'''. Diplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cladophora|Cladophora glomerata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O. P. Sharma. Textbook of Algae, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acetabularia]]''&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;)
* In [[stramenopiles]]: some [[brown algae]] (the [[Fucales]], however, their life cycle can also be interpreted as strongly heteromorphic-diplohaplontic, with a highly reduced gametophyte phase, as in the [[flowering plants]]),&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al.

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diplohaplontic English.svg|thumb|250px|Sporic meiosis]]
{{Main|Alternation of generations}}
In '''sporic meiosis''' (also commonly known as '''intermediary meiosis'''), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which ''also'' then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called [[gametophyte]]s. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: [[red algae]] (which have two sporophyte generations), some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''), [[Embryophyte|land plants]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[stramenopiles]]: most [[brown algae]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[rhizaria]]ns: many [[foraminiferan]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[plasmodiophoromycetes]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[amoebozoa]]: [[myxogastrid]]s
* In [[opisthokont]]s: some [[fungi]] (some [[chytrid]]s, some [[ascomycetes]] like the [[brewer's yeast]])&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* Other eukaryotes: [[haptophyte]]s&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt;

Some animals have a [[sex-determination system]] called [[haplodiploid]], but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some [[red algae]] (such as ''Bonnemaisonia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/tejp/2009/00000044/00000003/art00012|title=Somatic meiosis in the life history of Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Bonnemaisonia clavata (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) from the Iberian peninsula|first1=Noemi|last1=Salvador Soler|first2=Amelia|last2=Gomez Garreta|first3=M.|last3=Antonia Ribera Siguan|date=1 August 2009|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=381–393|via=IngentaConnect|doi=10.1080/09670260902780782}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lemanea]]'') and green algae (such as ''[[Prasiola]]'') have '''vegetative meiosis''', also called '''somatic meiosis''', which is a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;van den Hoek, C. et al. (1995), pp. 82, 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called '''vegetative diploidization''', a type of [[apomixis]], occurs in some [[brown alga]]e (e.g., ''Elachista stellaris'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, R.J.|year=1996|title=Chromosomes of the brown algae|journal=Phycologia|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19–40|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1|doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., [[Cryptophyta]], [[Choanoflagellata]], many  [[Euglenozoa]], many [[Amoebozoa]], some red algae, some [[green algae]], the [[imperfect fungi]], some [[rotifer]]s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heywood, P. |author2=Magee, P.T. |year=1976|title=Meiosis in protists.

[[Image:ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg|thumb|A chimeric mouse with its [[offspring]]]]
A '''genetic chimerism''' or '''chimera''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/kɪˈmɪərə/]] or [[Help:IPA/English|/kaɪˈmɪərə/]], also '''chimaera''' (c''himæra'') is a single organism composed of cells with distinct [[genotype]]s. In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; (this is just one of many different ways that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].

==Animals==
An animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

This condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].&lt;ref name="Strain" /&gt; Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

===Tetragametic chimerism===
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As the organism develops, it can come to possess [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s that have different sets of [[chromosome]]s. For example, the chimera may have a [[liver]] composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a [[kidney]] composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare, though more recent evidence suggests that it is not the case.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Aaron|author2=Ozzie Zehner|title=Which Half Is Mommy?: Tetragametic Chimerism and Trans-Subjectivity|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=Fall/Winter|pages=106–127|url=https://ucdavis.academia.edu/AaronTNorton/Papers/126923/Which_Half_Is_Mommy_Tetragametic_Chimerism_and_Trans-Subjectivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boklage, C.E. How New Humans Are Made. Hackensack, NJ; London: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd; 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This is particularly true for the [[marmoset]]. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name="Ross2007" /&gt; 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through [[chorionic]] fusions, making them [[hematopoietic]] chimeras.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=cell|title=Generation of Chimeric Rhesus Monkeys| author=Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]]| date=January 2012| pmc=3264685| pmid=22225614| doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.007| volume=148| pages=285–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N.| last1=Gengozian| last2=Batson| first2=JS| first3=P.| last3=Eide| title=Hematologic and Cytogenetic Evidence for Hematopoietic Chimerism in the Marmoset, Tamarinus Nigricollis| journal=Cytogenetics| year=1964| volume=10| pages=384–393.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (''e.g.'', having a [[Thumb#Variations|hitchhiker's thumb]] and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75| title=2 ) In the chimera episode, the fact that the [subject] was a chimera was first established through a camera flash on the skin illuminating skin anomalies...| work=Ask a Geneticist| publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford School of Medicine]]| author= Barry Starr | deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Note that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics. 

Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]]s and [[calico cat|calico]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The existence of chimerism is problematic for DNA testing, a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel) |Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Microchimerism===
{{Main| Microchimerism}}

Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mothers' have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.
The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmc = 3023624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. They will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ceratiidae]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline chimerism===
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has recently been discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings, because of placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)&lt;ref name="Ross2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ross| first=C. N.|author2=J. A. French | author3=G.

===Research===
In biological research, chimeras are artificially produced by selectively transplanting embryonic cells from one organism onto the embryo of another, and allowing the resultant blastocyst to develop. Chimeras are not [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], which form from the fusion of [[gametes]] from two species that form a single [[zygote]] with a combined genetic makeup. Nor are they [[Hybridoma technology|Hybridomas]], which, as with hybrids, result from the fusion of two species' cells into a single cell and artificial propagation of this cell in the laboratory. Essentially, in a chimera, each cell is from either of the parent species, whereas in a hybrid and hybridoma, each cell is derived from both parent species. "Chimera" is a broad term and is often applied to many different mechanisms of the mixing of cells from two different species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As with cloning, the process of creating and implanting a chimera is imprecise, with the majority of embryos spontaneously terminating. Successes, however, have led to major advancements in the field of embryology, as creating chimeras of one species with different physical traits, such as colour, has allowed researchers to trace the differentiation of embryonic cells through the formation of organ systems in the adult individual.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, with each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from [[totipotent]] four cell blastocysts; although the cells never fused they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku's blood cells contained two x chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Masahito Tachibana, Michelle Sparman and Shoukhrat Mitalipov"/&gt;

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984, when a chimeric [[sheep-goat chimera|geep]] was produced by combining [[embryo]]s from a [[goat]] and a [[sheep]], and survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921546,00.html | title = It's a Geep | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 27 February 1984 | accessdate = 4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the "geep" revealed several complexities to chimera development. In implanting a goat embryo for gestation in a sheep, the sheep's immune system would reject the developing goat embryo, whereas a "geep" embryo (sharing markers of immunity with both sheep and goats) was able to survive implantation in either of its parent species.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In August 2003, researchers at the [[Shanghai Second Medical University]] in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and [[rabbit]] ova to create the first human chimeric embryos. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting, then destroyed to harvest the resulting [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0125_050125_chimeras.html| title=Animal-Human Hybrids Spark Controversy| last=Mott| first=Maryann| date=January 25, 2005| work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, scientists at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |title=Iranian scientist creates sheep with half-human organs |date=27 Mar 2007 |work=[[Press TV]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114210217/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=3995&amp;sectionid=3510208 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into such problems as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.
The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W. K. | title = "Intrinsic" Immunological Tolerance in Allophenic Mice | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3807 | pages = 1484–6 | year = 1967 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3807.1484 |pmid=6058691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected [[embryonic stem cells]] (ES cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(86)90161-7 | last1 = Robertson | first1 = EJ | year = 1986 | title = Pluripotential stem cell lines as a route into the mouse germ line | url = | journal = Trends Genet | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 9–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. | volume = 85 | issue = 22| pages = 8583–8587 | pmid = 3186749 | pmc = 282503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155–6163 | pmid = 14623817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 283–290 | pmid = 1033982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst for example can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.&lt;ref&gt;Pappaioannou, V., R. Johnson. (1993). Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells. In Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach (ed. A.Joyner) IRL Press at Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
From this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be genetically altered in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(85)90143-0 | last1 = Kubiak | first1 = J | last2 = Tarkowski | first2 = A. | year = 1985 | title = Electrofusion of mouse blastomeres.

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804–8808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603–613 | pmid = 11187956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse, which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells.&lt;ref&gt;Chimera Mouse production by blastocyst injection, Wellcome trust Sanger Institute, http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tanaka | first1 = M | last2 = Hadjantonakis | first2 = AK | last3 = Nagy | first3 = A | title = Aggregation chimeras.

The tissues may be partially fused together following [[grafting]] to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norris, R. |author2=Smith, R.H. |author3=Vaughn, K.C. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Plant chimeras used to establish de novo origin of shoots | journal=Science | year=1983 | pages=75–76 | volume=220 | doi=10.1126/science.220.4592.75 | issue=4592 | pmid=17736164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their [[periclinal]] chimeras is like to be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9rxMGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Plant+Chimeras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fCO6Te3DEoKutweGpaC3AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ ''Plant Chimeras''], 1st edition, 1992, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42787-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such known chimera was probably the [[Bizzaria]], which is a fusion of the [[Florentine citron]] and the [[sour orange]]. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are [[+Laburnocytisus 'Adamii'|''Laburnocytisus'' 'Adamii']], caused by a fusion of a ''[[Laburnum]]'' and a [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], and "Family" trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a [[rootstock]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Chromosomal chimeras===
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their [[chromosome]] constitution. Occasionally chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to [[cell division|misdivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thompson, J.D. |author2=Herre, E.A. |author3=Hamrick, J.L. |author4=Stone, J.L. |last-author-amp=yes| title= Genetic Mosaics in strangler Fig Trees: Implication for Tropical Conservation | journal=Science | year=1991 | pages=1214–1216 | volume=254 | issue=5035 | doi= 10.1126/science.254.5035.1214 | pmid=17776412}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

===Nuclear gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Plastid gene-differential chimeras===
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or [[nucleic acid thermodynamics]], plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their [[mendelian inheritance|non-mendelian inheritance]]. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the [[chloroplast]]s in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own but is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Origins===
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during plant recovery stage:

(1) The process of shoot [[organogenesis]] starts form the multicellular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhu, X. |author2=Zhao, M. |author3=Ma, S. |author4=Ge, Y. |author5=Zhang, M. |author6=Chen, L. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Induction and origin of adventitious shoots from chimeras of Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=1727–1732 | volume=26 | issue=10 | doi=10.1007/s00299-007-0398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.

(3) A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Park SH, Rose SC, Zapata C, Srivatanakul M | title= Cross-protection and selectable marker genes in plant transformation. | journal= In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant| year=1998 | pages=117–121 | volume=34 | issue=2 | doi= 10.1007/BF02822775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(4) The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Detection===
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. Because it’s extremely important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as [[GUS reporter system|GUS]] and [[Green Fluorescent Protein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rakosy-Tican, E. |author2=Aurori, C.M. |author3=Dijkstra, C. |author4=Thieme, R. |author5=Aurori, A. |author6=Davey, M.R. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The usefulness of the gfp reporter gene for monitoring Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of potato dihaploid and tetraploid genotypes | journal=Plant Cell Rep | year=2007 | pages=661–671 | volume=26 | issue=5 | doi=10.1007/s00299-006-0273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;(GFP) are utilized in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.) However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. [[Quantitative PCR]] could be an alternative method for chimera detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Faize, M., Faize, L. and Burgos, L. | title=Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect chimeras in transgenic tobacco and apricot and to monitor their dissociation | journal=BMC Biotechnology | year=2010 | pages=53 | volume=10 | issue=1 | doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and legislation==
{{See also|Bioethics}}

===Ethics===
The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;Futehally, Ilmas, Beyond Biology, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] [http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=77#.UyZHJ1GSxv0]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights.&lt;ref name="Defining Humanity"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 – Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
{{anchor|Chimera_(genetics)#Legislation}}&lt;!-- linked from [[Human Chimera Prohibition Act]] --&gt;In May 2008, a robust debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the ethics of creating chimeras with human stem cells led to the decision that embryos would be allowed to be made in laboratories, given that they would be destroyed within the first 14 days.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 11 July 2005, a bill, The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator 
[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases and the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.&lt;ref name="Human Chimera Prohibition Act"/&gt; Since the bill's death in congress, there has not been another attempt at setting regulations on chimera research in the United States.

[[Image:Chirality with hands.svg|200px|thumb|Two enantiomers of a generic [[amino acid]] that is '''chiral''']]

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|iː}} is a property of [[asymmetry]] important in several branches of science. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|χειρ}} (''kheir''), "hand," a familiar chiral object.

An object or a system is ''chiral'' if it is distinguishable from its [[mirror image]]; that is, it cannot be [[wikt:superposed|superposed]] onto it.  Conversely, a mirror image of an ''achiral'' object, such as a sphere, cannot be distinguished from the object. A chiral object and its mirror image are called ''enantiomorphs'' (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, ''[[enantiomers]]''. A non-chiral object is called ''achiral'' (sometimes also ''amphichiral'') and can be superposed on its mirror image. If the object is non-chiral and is imagined as being colored blue and its mirror image is imagined as colored yellow, then by a series of rotations and translations the two can be superposed, producing green, with none of the original colors remaining.

The term was first used by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] in 1893 in the second [[Robert Boyle Lecture]] at the [[Oxford University Junior Scientific Club]] which was published in 1894:

{{quote|I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Molecular Tactics of a Crystal |author=Sir William Thomson Lord Kelvin | year=1894 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | url=https://archive.org/details/moleculartactic00kelvgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Human [[hand]]s are perhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand; no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes.&lt;ref name="OCATUA"&gt;Georges Henry Wagnière, ''On Chirality and the Universal Asymmetry: Reflections on Image and Mirror Image'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand. In mathematics, ''chirality'' is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

{{main|Chirality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone.  For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise. See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition.

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be enantiomorphs. The word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called achiral or amphichiral.

The [[helix]] (and by extension a spun string, a screw, a propeller, etc.) and [[Möbius strip]] are chiral two-dimensional objects in three-dimensional ambient space. The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space.

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves, glasses (where two lenses differ in prescription), and shoes. A similar notion of chirality is considered in [[knot theory]], as explained below.

Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the helix, can be assigned a right or left handedness, according to the [[right-hand rule]].

===Geometry===
In [[geometry]] a figure is achiral if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry.
In two dimensions, every figure that possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry.
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[plane of symmetry]] or a center of symmetry is achiral. There are, however, achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry.
In terms of [[point groups]], all chiral figures lack an improper axis of rotation (S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). This means that they cannot contain a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (σ). Only figures with a point group designation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T, O, or I can be chiral.

===Knot theory===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called chiral. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

{{main|Chirality (physics)}}

In physics, chirality may be found in the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1995/nov/lookingfortherig591|title=Looking for the Right Hand - DiscoverMagazine.com|author=|date=|website=discovermagazine.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]], which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon like spin. Although both can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case do they have a simple relation.&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2011/06/19/helicity-chirality-mass-and-the-higgs/|title=Quantum Diaries|author=|date=|website=www.quantumdiaries.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The ''handedness'' in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness (ex. translating leftwards and rotating counterclockwise) or right-handedness (ex. translating in the right direction and rotating clockwise).&lt;ref name="quantumdiaries.org"/&gt; A symmetry transformation between the two is called [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Invariance under parity by a [[Dirac fermion]] is called ''chiral symmetry''.

===Electromagnetism===

{{main|Chirality (electromagnetism)}}

[[Electromagnetic radiation|Electromagnetic]] wave [[Wave propagation|propagation]] as [[handedness]] is wave [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and described in terms of [[Circular dichroism|helicity]] (occurs as a helix). Polarization of an [[electromagnetic wave]] is the property that describes the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], i.e., the [[periodic function|time-varying]], direction ([[Euclidean vector|vector]]), and [[amplitude]] of the [[electric field]] vector. For a depiction, see the adjacent image.

{{main|Chirality (chemistry)}}

A ''chiral molecule'' is a type of [[molecule]] that has a non-superposable [[mirror image]]. The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon atom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chiral" in general is used to describe the object that is non-superposable on its mirror image.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=chirality|file=C01058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a chiral molecule are called [[enantiomer]]s or optical [[isomer]]s. Pairs of enantiomers are often designated as "[[right-handed|right-]]", "left-handed" or if it has no bias achiral. As polarized light passes through a chiral molecule, the plane of polarization, when viewed along the axis toward the source, will be rotated in a clockwise (to the right) or anticlockwise (to the left). A right handed rotation is dextrorotary (d); that to the left is levorotary (l). The d- and l-isomers are the same compound but are called [[enantiomers]]. An equimolar mixture of the two optical isomers will produce no net rotation of polarized light as it passes through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Raymond|title=Chemistry|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-394-32983-X|page=660|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left handed molecules have l- prefixed to their names; d- is prefixed to right handed molecules.

Molecular chirality is of interest because of its application to [[stereochemistry]] in [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[supramolecular chemistry]].

More recent developments in chiral chemistry include the development of chiral inorganic nanoparticles that may have the similar tetrahedral geometry as chiral centers associated with sp3 carbon atoms traditionally associated with chiral compounds, but at larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moloney|first=Mícheál P.|last2=Gun'ko|first2=Yurii K.|last3=Kelly|first3=John M.|date=2007-09-26|title=Chiral highly luminescent CdS quantum dots|url=https://doi.org/10.1039/b704636g|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=0|issue=38|doi=10.1039/b704636g|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaaff|first=T.

Deviation (having the opposite form) could be found in a small number of chemical compounds, or certain organ or behavior but that variation strictly depends upon the genetic make up of the organism. From chemical level (molecular scale), biological systems show extreme stereospecificity in synthesis, uptake, sensing, metabolic processing. A living system usually deals with two enantiomers of same compound in a drastically different way.

In biology, homochirality is a common property of [[Amino acid#Isomerism|amino acids]] and [[Monosaccharide#Open-chain stereoisomers|carbohydrates]]. The chiral [[Proteinogenic amino acid|protein-making amino acids]], which are translated through the ribosome from genetic coding, occur in the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; form. However, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids are also found in nature. The monosaccharides (carbohydrate-units) are commonly found in &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-configuration. DNA double helix is chiral (as any kind of [[Helix#Types|helix]] is chiral), and [[B-DNA|B-form of DNA]] shows a right-handed turn.

Sometimes, when two enantiomers of a compound found in organisms, they significantly differ in their taste, smell and other biological actions. For example, (+)-Limonene found in orange (causing its smell), and (–)-Limonene found in Lemons (causing its smell), show different smells&lt;ref&gt;Solomon and Fryhles organic chemistry, Ed 10, Wiley (Students edition), Chapter 5 (Stereochemistry), Section 5.5 More about biological significance of chirality&lt;/ref&gt; due to different biochemical interactions at human nose.

Also, for artificial compounds, including medicines, in case of chiral drugs, the two enantiomers sometimes show remarkable difference in effect of their biological actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanganyado|first=Edmond|last2=Lu|first2=Zhijiang|last3=Fu|first3=Qiuguo|last4=Schlenk|first4=Daniel|last5=Gan|first5=Jay|date=2017|title=Chiral pharmaceuticals: A review on their environmental occurrence and fate processes|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0043135417306565|journal=Water Research|volume=124|pages=527–542|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.003|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darvon ([[Dextropropoxyphene]]) is a painkiller, whereas its enantiomer, Novrad ([[Levopropoxyphene]]) is an anti-cough agent.

Macroscopic example of Chirality is found in plant kingdom, animal kingdom and all other groups of organism. A simple example is the coiling direction of any climber plants. It may be one of two possible type of helix.

[[File:Neptunea - links&amp;rechts gewonden.jpg|thumb|200px|Shells of two different species of sea snail: on the left is the normally sinistral (left-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea angulata]]'', on the right is the normally dextral (right-handed) shell of ''[[Neptunea despecta]]'']]
In anatomy, chirality is found in the imperfect mirror image symmetry of many kinds of animal bodies. Organisms such as [[gastropod]]s exhibit chirality in their coiled shells, resulting in an asymmetrical appearance. Over 90% of gastropod species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilthuizen | first1 = M. | last2 = Davison | first2 = A. | year = 2005 | title = The convoluted evolution of snail chirality | url = | journal = [[Naturwissenschaften]] | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 504–515 | doi =  10.1007/s00114-05-0045-2| bibcode = 2005NW.....92..504S }}&lt;/ref&gt; have ''dextral'' (right-handed) shells in their coiling, but a small minority of species and genera are virtually always ''sinistral'' (left-handed). A very few species (for example ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm|title=Amphidromus perversus (Linnaeus, 1758)|author=|date=|website=www.jaxshells.org|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) show an equal mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals.

In humans, chirality (also referred to as ''handedness'' or ''laterality'') is an attribute of humans defined by their unequal distribution of [[fine motor skill]] between the left and right [[hands]]. An individual who is more [[Dexterity|dexterous]] with the right hand is called ''[[right-handed]]'', and one who is more skilled with the left is said to be ''[[left-handed]]''. Chirality is also seen in the study of [[facial asymmetry]].

In flatfish, the [[Summer flounder]] or fluke are left-eyed, while [[halibut]] are right-eyed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7458">[[File:2 parallel footprints.png|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==
[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|left|Left and [[right-hand rule]]s in three dimensions]]

![[File:Tetromino S.svg|100px]]&lt;BR&gt;S
![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]&lt;BR&gt;Z
|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral&lt;!--sic!--&gt; if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto Av+b&lt;/math&gt; with an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is either 1 or &amp;minus;1 then. If it is &amp;minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition of chirality.

==Chirality in three dimensions==
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.1.svg|thumb|Pair of chiral [[dice]] (enantiomorphs)]]
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[mirror plane of symmetry]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', an inversion center of symmetry ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', or a higher [[improper rotation]] (rotoreflection) ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. Symmetry operations and symmetry elements|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)&lt;/math&gt; and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.&lt;br&gt;This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

'''''Creatures''''' is an [[artificial life]] (alife) [[computer program]] series, created in the mid-1990s by English [[computer science|computer scientist]] [[Steve Grand (roboticist)|Steve Grand]] whilst working for the [[Cambridge]] [[video game]]s developer [[Millennium Interactive]]. Gameplay focuses on raising alien creatures known as Norns, teaching them to survive, helping them explore their world, defending them against other species, and breeding them. Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it. After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey.  A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs.  The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures.  Rather than taking a scripted approach, Creatures series games were driven by detailed biological and neurological simulation and their unexpected results. There were six major Creatures releases from Creature Labs. Between 1996 and 2001, there were three principal games released, the Docking Station add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games, and there were three games created for console systems.  A sequel named ''Creatures Online'' was in development, with the artificial life technology from Creatures 3 and Docking Station updated to a 3D environment.

To create this kind of behaviour, Grand felt it was necessary to program the creatures by simulating the building blocks of nature in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] approach, allowing the complex behaviour to [[Emergence|emerge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grand|first=Steve|title=Human cognition and social agent technology|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9027251398|page=350|editor=Dautenhahn, Kerstin|chapter=The Emergence of Personality: How to Create Souls from Cells}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than using a [[rule-based system]] approach.&lt;ref name="Dr.Frankenstein"/&gt;  Grand later wished to include references to an "English" or Norse mythology, to try to make the world more internally consistent,&lt;ref name=mainhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/creatures_history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028181218/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/creatures_history.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |title=Creatures history |author=Grand, Steve |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=2004-06-04 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mythography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/mythography.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203124/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/mythography.htm |archivedate=2008-09-27 |title=Small Furry Creatures: A Mythography |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=8 March 1993 |author=Grand, Steve |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but found that the team wanted to make the game into a conventional adventure game.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt; He later decided to scale back on the mythology aspects of the game, focusing instead on the [[artificial life]] point - eventually presenting the game as an artificial [[animal fancy|pet hobby]], which provided some of the impetus to include genetics in the creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/pleasureprofit.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203129/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/pleasureprofit.htm |archivedate=2008-09-27 |author=Grand, Steve |title="Breeding Norns for Pleasure and Profit" — some thoughts |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=1 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Creatures'' was developed as a consumer product by [[Millennium Interactive|Millennium]], and was released by [[Mindscape Group|Mindscape]] in 1996. The program was instantly successful,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and an [[online community]] of players soon formed, swapping Norns, creating new objects for Albia,&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"/&gt; sharing tips on how to play the game and anecdotes about unexpected evolutionary changes that they had seen, and even creating new [[Selective breeding|breeds]] of Norn. At one point, the Creatures online community was the largest of its type.

In 1996, ''Creatures'' won an EMMA Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=1996 |title=1996 Winners |publisher=The International EMMA Awards |date=2000-11-21 |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420074653/http://www.emma-foundation.org/prevWin.asp?section=1996 |archivedate=2001-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/cyberlife_awards2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970607011020/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/cyberlife_awards2.htm |archivedate=1997-06-07 |title=CREATURES WINS INTERNATIONAL EMMA AWARD |publisher=cyberlife.co.uk |date=1997-06-07 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on sales of 500,000 copies of ''Creatures'' from 1996 through to the second quarter of 1998, it was estimated that at that time, there was a possible global population of up to five million norns.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;

Development of ''[[Creatures 2]]'' began in Q3 1997.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt;  In 1998, the video games division of [[Millennium Interactive|Millennium]] was sold to Sony Entertainment while those working on alife and ''Creatures'' formed a new company called Cyberlife Technology. Along with continued work on the ''Creatures'' titles, the company did work for industry and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]], famously attempting to teach live organisms to fly virtual [[fighter jet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/ns/980509/features.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117012705/http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980509/features.html |archivedate=1999-01-17 |title=New Scientist Planet Science: Agents from Albia |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=1999-01-17 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/richard.pdf |title=Norn Attacks and Marine Doom |publisher= |author=BIRGIT RICHARD |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' was nominated in the Artificial Intelligence category of the [[Game Developers Conference]]'s Spotlight Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Newstand/newsletters/ns_news_stuff_current.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010211202533/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Newstand/newsletters/ns_news_stuff_current.htm |title=Stuff&amp;NORNsense |publisher=Creatures.co.uk |archivedate=2001-02-11 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Grand left Cyberlife to form Cyberlife Research and focus on the production of new alife technologies, including work on a [[robotics|robotic]] life form he called Lucy as well as writing books about his research. The remainder of the company was renamed Creature Labs, and focused on [[video game development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=17_0_6_0_M8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517100548/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=17_0_6_0_M8 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creature Labs |publisher=Gamewaredevelopment.com |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequels to ''Creatures'', including ''Creatures 2'', ''[[Creatures 3]]'' and the small-children's games ''Creatures Adventures'' and ''Creatures Playground'', were released by Creature Labs in subsequent years.

Development was suspended on future ''Creatures'' games on March 20, 2003, when Creature Labs ceased operations, but development and trademark rights have since been purchased by Gameware Development, Ltd. Gameware has revived the Creatures Developer Network, the shop, the forums, the Docking Station server, and has released many before-purchasable tools and add-ons for free.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/diary.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015602/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/diary.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Gameware Development |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameware staff that previously worked on ''Creatures'' developed a convergent media game for the [[BBC]] called ''[[BAMZOOKi]]''.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt;

In 2004, the ''Creatures'' games have been re-released in combination packs under the names ''Creatures: The Albian Years'' (C1, C2), ''Creatures Exodus'' (C3, DS) and ''Creatures Village'' (CA, CP). The Albian Years, and Exodus include the separate games, whereas Village has merged Adventures and Playground into a single game.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt;

[[Kutoka Interactive]], a Canadian children's software company, has created releases of ''Creatures Exodus'' (Kutoka) and ''Creatures Village'' (Kutoka Kids) that are compatible with both Apple's [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows XP]].&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment1"/&gt; They were released on 30 September 2005, and can be purchased either directly from Kutoka or from other online stores.

Basic gameplay consists of hatching some creatures, usually norns, and guiding them to reach maturity and to breed more creatures, with the goal of a more intelligent future population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2874/designers_notebook_more_sexes_.php |title=Features - Designer's Notebook: More Sex(es) in Computer Games |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it.

===Species===
;Norns

A Norn is an AIL (Artificial intelligent life) species, the development and survival of which constitute the main thematic elements of the program.

Norns are playful, all-trusting, naive creatures that love to explore. This is often the reason for their downfall, suffering, and death. They are more susceptible to disease in comparison to Ettins and Grendels, and in old age they may fall prey to a wasting disease that prevents them from absorbing certain nutrients.

Grand wished Norns to be endearing and for players to keep them as pets - that they should be independent and stubborn, like toddlers, and that the design of the norn should be appealing to as many people as possible, and that the player should care about the norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_norn.htm |title=The evolution of a species |publisher=Creatures.org.uk |date=March 1994 |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010212093320/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_norn.htm |archivedate=2001-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewers have compared the Norns' visual design to the Mogwai of the ''[[Gremlins]]'' film series.&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepsen|first=Dawn|title=They're Dead, Jim: Natural Selection Goes Awry in This Depressing Update|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=January 1999|issue=174|pages=364, 366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwinnable.com/2012/01/27/playing-god-on-death-motherhood-and-creatures/#more-26486 |title=Playing God: On Death, Motherhood and ‘Creatures’ |author=Frank, Jenn |publisher=Unwinnable |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shee originally created the Norns as a mixture of [[valet]] and pet. According to the Creatures Labs website, they spread across the galaxy through the Warp and evolved into various variations, including but not restricted to: Toxic Norn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=503_0_6_0_M26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015813/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=503_0_6_0_M26 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=The Toxic Norn Story |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treehugger Norn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=504_0_6_0_M26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205201459/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=504_0_6_0_M26 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-05 |title=The Treehugger Norn Story |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Magma Norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=501_0_6_0_M26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517020401/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/creatures_more.php?id=501_0_6_0_M26 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=The Magma Norn Story |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Norns throughout the galaxy is related to the mysterious disappearance of the Shee from Albia (from the point of view of the Norns). It may also be a sign of how the Shee fared in their attempt to find a habitable planet.

In the games, the Norns have their own simulated biochemistry, haploid genetics, and [[neural network]] to serve as a brain. From Creatures 2 onwards, Norns also possess organs determined by their genetics;&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt; mutation and injury can render these defunct, with typically fatal consequences. Each of these has grown somewhat over the course of the series, allowing the creatures to become more complex and intelligent. Norns are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, including carrots, lemons, seeds, insects, fish, honey, and other things. The Norns that the player starts with require some degree of training and discipline from the player in order to make good decisions to maintain their health; however, later on they can evolve to be more independent and hardy, with better-developed instincts and a more robust biochemistry. The player can take advantage of this to breed certain colours or traits through artificial selection, and through many generations the changes can become quite pronounced.

Norns are very social animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jepsen|first=Dawn|title=It's Alive: ''Creatures'' Is Bound To Tickle Your Fancy|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=November 1997|issue=160|pages=314–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes to the extent that they will prefer to play with other norns than to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971016000951/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_june2.htm |url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_june2.htm |title=Creatures Newsletter June p.2 |publisher=Cyberlife |archivedate=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312050032/http://worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/creature.htm |url=http://worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/creature.htm |title=Creatures |publisher=Gamer's Zone |author=Meinfelder, Edmond |archivedate=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shee
[[File:Shee statue.png|thumb|right|The statue of a Shee in ''[[Creatures 2]]''. This is one of very few official in-game appearances of the Shee. (There are more hidden deeper in.)]]
The Shee are a race of absent-minded scientists. They are the original inhabitants of Albia, and the creators of the Norns, Ettins, and Grendels.

The Shee are all inventors, and make most of their inventions to save time on tasks that would have taken but a few minutes otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_shee.htm |title=Shee Mystery Unfolds |publisher=creatures.org.uk |accessdate=2012-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001214182000/http://www.creatures.co.uk/Library/History/lib_history_shee.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of their discoveries are made by accident, and as such, they sequenced their own [[DNA]] and eliminated all genetic defects, before discovering the wheel.

Millennia ago, the Shee had left the disk-shaped world of Albia, as they desired to live on a "more spherical world". They created the Shee Ark, took along some Norns, Ettins, and various animals and plants, and set out for their new home. The Shee Ark, like all Shee spacecraft, was itself a living creature grown from scratch, and used "Bioenergy" (the energy of living things, used to balance the game) to perform its various functions.

Early concepts of the Shee had them as merely a more advanced life form than the Norns, not their creators.&lt;ref name=definitivearticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/definitivearticle.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927203105/http://fp.cyberlifersrch.plus.com/creaturesarchive/definitivearticle.htm |author=Grand, Steve |archivedate=2008-09-27 |title=Small Furry Creatures: The Definitive Article |publisher=Cyberlife Research |date=4 November 1994 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ettins
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ettin.jpg|thumb|left|123px|An Ettin from [[Creatures|Creatures 3]].]] --&gt;Ettins are a species in ''[[Creatures 2]]'' and ''[[Creatures 3]]''.

Ettins were created by the Shee to help them on their experiments, especially when using machinery. They made them like machines so much, they tend to steal bits for themselves, often taking them to wherever they consider their home.

''C2'' Ettins behave rather differently; they tend to lead a sad and lonely life underground with no one but Pitz and the occasional Grendel for company. The backstory in the guides and manual, as well as the opening sequence, reveals that they once lived in the desert at the top of Albia and, true to their nature, built the pyramid that sits there. The actual use (if any) of the pyramid is unknown.

Ettins were introduced into the ''Creatures'' series in ''C2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creatures.co.uk/creatures2_news1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206040212/http://www.creatures.co.uk/creatures2_news1.htm |archivedate=1998-12-06 |title=Creatures 2 Newsletter 1. |publisher=creatures.org.uk |date=1998-12-06 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been revealed to the world after the volcanic eruption.

An early concept of the Ettins described them as insignificant "small, lizard-like creatures", who were often kept as pets by Norns.&lt;ref name=mythography/&gt;

The Ettins in ''Creatures 2'' were infertile; however, in ''Creatures 3'', there were two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was possible to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the Gene Splicer machine to create a male Ettin.

An in-depth exploration of the genetics and neurology of the Ettins in ''Creatures 2'' revealed that they were constantly in pain, apparently by design. This discovery was met by fan uproar.

;Grendels
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:C2 Grendelimage.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Creatures 2]] Grendel]] --&gt;
Grendels are the green-skinned, red-eyed antagonists of the Norns, over which the player has little control, stealing food and injuring individual Norns. They also carry diseases harmful to Norns.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;  The early concepts of their appearance described them as "resembling a huge, titanium spider".&lt;ref name=mythography/&gt;

In the unmodified ''Creatures 1'' and ''2'', Grendels do not reproduce, being born infertile. Generally, only one Grendel is alive in the world of Albia at a time. In ''Creatures 3'', two Grendels were alive aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both male), but it was possible to get them to breed and have offspring if both were placed in the Gene Splicer machine and used to create a female Grendel.

In all three games, Grendels are automatically produced by a "Mother" machine; in ''Creatures 3'', however, it is possible to ensure that there are no Grendels in the game by killing any existing grendels (e.g. in the [[airlock]]) and then waiting by the mother, then placing any eggs into water (the [[piranha]] pool) so that they cannot hatch.

The Grendels were another genetically engineered creation of the Shee, albeit an accidental one. They were certainly not what the Shee were trying to get as a result from their experiments, and were considered to be harmful, useless monsters. However, some of the evil Shee (known as the Banshee) believed the Grendels were genetically superior to the Norns, and kept some for improvement.

It is possible to cross a Norn with a Grendel, creating a 'Grenorn'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/news/topstories/0,1287,5037,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129065439/http://www.wired.com/news/topstories/0%2C1287%2C5037%2C00.html |archivedate=2001-11-29 |title=Digital DNA Swap Meet |publisher=Wired.com |date=2001-11-29 |accessdate=2012-12-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971015235359/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_july.htm |url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_newsletter_july.htm |title=Creatures July Newsletter Page 1 |publisher=Cyberlife |archivedate=1997-10-15 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creatures community has appeared to adopt the Grendel as an underdog figure, creating a "Grendel Liberation Front" - despite being intended to add stress to Norns' lives, players began to tame their Grendels.&lt;ref name=TCGDE/&gt;

===User Interface===
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
In each of the games, players interact with the world through the use of a graphical hand as the player's mouse in the main visual area of the game. In ''Creatures'' and ''Creatures 2'', players can use applets in a toolbar, often called Kits, along the top of the game window, to access many functions, such as getting their first norn eggs, naming and photographing their norns, monitoring the health and general biochemistry of the norns and administering medicines, monitoring pregnancies, injecting objects into the world, and recording deceased norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_toolbar.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971016002046/http://www.cyberlife.co.uk/creatures_toolbar.htm |archivedate=1997-10-16 |title=THE CREATURES TOOLBAR. |publisher=Cyberlife |date=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C1Manual.pdf |title=Creatures Deluxe Breeder's Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224453/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C1Manual.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' introduced an Ecology Kit and Neuroscience Kit.&lt;ref name=C2manual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C2Manual.pdf |title=Creatures 2 Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232906/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C2Manual.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Creature 3 and Docking Station, players still use a hand as their mouse to interact with creatures and the world, but the main game area does not have toolbars like in Creatures and Creatures 2, but instead has areas along the sides of the screens with buttons that the user can press to move to different locations, view the current creatures in the world, manage an inventory of items, and change game settings.

Charlie Brooker regarded the level of detail shown in the monitoring kits as "terrifying",&lt;ref name="Brooker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooker|first=Charlie|title=Creatures|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2854/creatures|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120064244/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2854/creatures|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 January 2013|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=12 Aug 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been argued that the detailed monitoring kits highlight the artificiality of the norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=Have You Played… Creatures?|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/20/have-you-played-creatures/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Smith disliked the limitation of C1 that the player is "limited to seeing areas that you've tagged as favorite places or that are currently inhabited by Norns," and found it difficult to correctly reward and punish the creatures.&lt;ref name="cdmag2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/013/creatures_review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031027104034/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/013/creatures_review.html|archivedate=2003-10-27 |title=Creatures Review |author=Smith, Peter |publisher=[[Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |date=1998-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures 2 introduced an angel and devil glyph which appears next to the hand to show you whether you are about to reward or punish your creature.&lt;ref name="C2manual" /&gt; Jim Brumbaugh, in reviewing ''Creatures'', disliked the amount of typing that was needed to communicate with the creatures, but found the menu system "highly user friendly."

===Environment===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
While the initial pitch was for a desktop pet that could interact with other Windows programs, for example, [[Windows Media Player]],&lt;ref name=initialpitch/&gt; as the game developed, the need for a self-contained world became more apparent.  The world was named "Albia", after [[Albion]], and one of the goals of gameplay became to explore Albia.&lt;ref name=rationale/&gt;&lt;ref name=definitivearticle/&gt;  Grand thought that having the creatures inhabit a rich, "messy", world, and to be able to interact with it in many ways would help creatures' personalities to emerge.&lt;ref name="grand352"/&gt;  The backdrop for ''Creatures'' was created by taking photographs of a physical model of the world,&lt;ref name=mainhistory/&gt; part of which is now housed at [[The Centre for Computing History]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/42694/Creatures-Model/ Creatures Model - Computing History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world is rendered in [[2.5D]], and the world can smoothly scroll to follow a creature.  The world contains many different items, which creatures can interact with in a variety of ways.  Objects are written using an [[object-oriented programming]] technique - each item has their own scripts which determine how they interact with creatures and with other objects.  Objects are detected by a creature by being in its line of sight, which excites a neuron dedicated to that class of objects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mrl.snu.ac.kr/courses/CourseSyntheticCharacter/grand96creatures.pdf |title=Creatures: Artificial Life Autonomous Software Agents for Home Entertainment |author1=Grand, Steve |author2=Cliff, Dave |author3=Mahotra, Anil. |year=1996 |publisher=Millennium Technical Report 9601; University of Sussex Technical Report CSRP434 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object-oriented approach means that the games are highly [[Mod (video gaming)|modifiable]].&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;  Some of the items in the world are dangerous to norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Bonnie|title=Creatures|url=http://www.elecplay.com/pc/creatures.html|publisher=[[The Electronic Playground]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970801040044/http://www.elecplay.com/pc/creatures.html|archivedate=1 August 1997|date=June 11, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Creatures 2'', the environment became more complex, with a "Complete working eco-system, including weather, seasons and a functioning food-chain. The plants seed and spread around the environment if conditions allow. The result of this is a very "real" feeling world that adapts around the player."&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"/&gt;

In ''Creatures 3'' and ''Docking Station'', the game was set on a spaceship.  The environment became more segmented into areas called "metarooms", small biomes, each with their own ecosystem.  Players could download and add new metarooms to their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/C3manual.pdf |title=Creatures 3 Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads/DSManual.pdf |title=Creatures Docking Station Manual |format=PDF |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2012-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games in the series==

There were six major ''Creatures'' releases from Creature Labs. In addition to the three principal games, the ''Docking Station'' add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children's games were released.

===''On Albia'' (later re-released as ''Creatures: The Albian Years'')===

====''Creatures''====
The original ''Creatures'' game, released in the United Kingdom and Australia in November 1996 and in North America in July 1997, took place on the fictional disc-shaped world Albia. While the "faces" of the disc were uninhabitable, the "rim" of Albia was home to a complicated [[natural environment|environment]] much like Earth's. Here lay an abandoned system of [[laboratory|laboratories]] left over by the Shee, an advanced race that had suddenly left the planet many years earlier in order to find a more stable world. In these laboratories and environments, the player was able to hatch new Norns from leftover [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and re-inhabit the world of Albia. According to Millenium, every copy of ''Creatures'' contains a unique starting set of eggs, whose genomes are not replicated on any other copy of the game.&lt;ref name="NGen23"/&gt; An expansion pack, called "Life Kit #1" was released for purchase later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/034/lifekit_review.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705043628/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/010/034/lifekit_review.html |archivedate=2003-07-05 |title=Creatures Life Kit #1 Review |author=Smith, Peter |publisher=[[Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |date=1998-01-31 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Creatures'' sold 100,000 copies by November 1997. At the time, John Moore of Mindscape explained that the company "expect[s] to sell more than 200,000 ''Creatures'' by the end of the year."&lt;ref name=sales1&gt;{{cite web | author=Anderson, Jill | title=Mindscape Sells 100,000 ''Creatures'' | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000520041544/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_11/03_creature/index.html | url=http://headline.gamespot.com:80/news/97_11/03_creature/index.html | archivedate=May 20, 2000 | work=[[GameSpot]] | date=November 3, 1997 | deadurl=yes | access-date=August 3, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Creatures 2''====

[[File:Creatures 2 game new Norn.PNG|right|thumb|Creatures 2 added 16-bit graphics and a larger world]]

''[[Creatures 2]]'', released on September 30, 1998, took place many years after the first game, after a devastating [[natural disaster]] (or, as explained in later games, a devastating Shee disaster) had changed the [[landscape]] of Albia dramatically and opened up new areas of the world. New [[technology]] and [[species]] were made available to the [[Player (game)|player]], and the creatures themselves had been provided with "considerably more sensory input, more actions they can take, and improved brain dynamics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=July 1998|title=Creatures 2|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the great change in environment, including a "complete working eco-system",&lt;ref name="Gamasutra C2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3271/from_creatures_to_androids.php |title=Features - From Creatures to Androids |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the focus of the game remained the same. Creatures 2 Deluxe (with Life Kit) soon followed.  200,000 copies of ''Creatures 2'' were immediately shipped upon its release.&lt;ref name=TCGDE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cliff|first=Dave|author2=Grand, Stephen|title=The Creatures Global Digital Ecosystem|journal=Artificial Life|year=1999|volume=5|issue=1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1162/106454699568683|pmid=10421678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two expansion packs, Life Kit 1 and Life Kit 2, were released for C2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=447_0_8_0_M15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517102057/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=447_0_8_0_M15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creatures 2 Life Kit 1 |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=34_0_8_0_M15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517102035/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/downloads_more.php?id=34_0_8_0_M15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-17 |title=Creatures 2 Life Kit 2 |publisher=Gameware Development |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Creatures 2'' was considered "much more difficult" than ''C1'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarkson|first=Mark|title=Creatures 2: Power-ups and Help on How to Keep Your Norns Alive|journal=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=February 1999|issue=175|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new, more challenging environment and norn biology was described as frustrating, but that after installing a new genome and going through successive generations, the Norns seemed smarter.&lt;ref name="Jepsen C2"/&gt;  Nick Walkland described the gameplay as a "labour of love", noting that the challenge was to sustain your Norns' lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walkland|first=Nick|title=Creatures 2|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2856/creatures-2|publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=12 Aug 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119175808/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2856/creatures-2|archivedate=19 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sid Fisk of Gamezilla criticized the audio for Creatures 2 for not alerting him when his creature was near-death, but playing a "funeral dirge" as the body left the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisk|first1=Sid|title=Creatures 2 by Mindscape &amp; Cyberlife Technology Ltd.|url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/c/creatures2.asp|website=Gamezilla|accessdate=10 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010622224025/http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/c/creatures2.asp|archivedate=22 June 2001|date=24 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''After Leaving Albia'' (later re-released as ''Creatures Exodus'')===

====''Creatures 3''====
''[[Creatures 3]]'', released on November 4, 1999, took a detour from the first two games. It took place on the [[starship|spaceship]] that the Shee had used to flee Albia. The ship was divided into many carefully controlled [[natural environment|environment]]s (Norn Terrarium, Jungle Terrarium, Desert Terrarium, Marine Terrarium). ''Creatures 3'' was much more technologically focused, including many agents which could be connected in various ways to perform tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000821070502/http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/Cont/0%2C7%2C0-3763_2%2C00.html |url=http://www.gamecenter.com/Reviews/Item/Cont/0,7,0-3763_2,00.html |title=Creatures 3 |publisher=Game Center.com |archivedate=2000-08-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the goal was to [[experiment]] with the three principal species and create a living world out of an empty ship.  ''Creatures 3'' included a "new social element",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2857/creatures-3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121042538/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/2857/creatures-3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-21 |title=Creatures 3 &amp;#124; ComputerAndVideoGames.com |publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |date=2001-08-12 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which norns could remember relationships they've formed with other creatures better.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment3"/&gt;

====''Docking Station''====
The final major ''Creatures'' release was ''Docking Station'', an [[Internet]]-based add-on to ''Creatures 3'', released free of charge on the ''Creatures'' web site on March 27, 2001.&lt;ref name="highlights"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2001/03/27/creatures-gets-new-creatures |title=Creatures Gets New Creatures |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended as a way to sell ''Creatures 3'' (you could dock the worlds of the two games together, hence the name ''"Docking" Station'') and extra packs of Norn breeds. ''Docking Station'' has an intermittent reminder screen that encourages users to buy ''Creatures 3''.

''Docking Station'' added the possibility of interaction between individual player worlds; Norns could 'travel' to other online worlds via a central server, players could [[online chat|chat]] to other online players, and it was possible to track Norns (and their offspring) that had been present in their worlds via the ''Docking Station'' website.&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment4"/&gt; While ''Docking Station'' was released late in the series' run, it changed gameplay (and the potential of the series) dramatically. One reviewer stated that it opened up a whole new world for her online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010607075048/http://gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18445.htm |url=http://gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18445.htm |title=Creatures Docking Station
 |publisher=GameZone |archivedate=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer criticised the online portion of the game, as it requires the player to find online buddies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadotte|first=Joseph|title=Creatures: Exodus|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=664 |publisher=[[Inside Mac Games]] |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Docking Station also expanded considerably on the game mythos, including the introduction of an 'anti-Shee', the Banshee (a Grendel/Shee hybrid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creaturelabs.com/creatures/expansion/banshee.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20021208182711/http://www.creaturelabs.com/creatures/expansion/banshee.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-12-08 |title=The Banshee Grendels |publisher=Creature Labs |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Creatures Online''===
''Creatures Online'' was a planned sequel to the game, which was being developed by Fishing Cactus. The game was announced as ''Creatures 4'' in Fishing Cactus's blog in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2011/05/18/announcing-creatures-4-on-ios-mac-and-pc/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Announcing Creatures 4 on iOS, Mac and PC |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creatures Online was to have 5 worlds, was to be completely in 3D graphics instead of [[2.5D]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; pre-rendered graphics, and in-game currency was planned to buy Norns toys, food, etc. Creatures Online was designed to be a [[free-to-play]] game.  A collector's edition box was also announced with a Norn figurine, the three original games for current PCs, and all the money you paid for the game as in-game money for your Norns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2011/08/22/the-uncensored-truth-about-creatures-4/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » The uncensored truth about Creatures 4 |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creatures 4 entered an in-house [[alpha test|alpha phase]] in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2013/02/21/creatures-4-qa-with-the-designers-alpha-test/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Creatures 4: Q&amp;A with the devs &amp; Alpha-test |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2013-02-21 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The internal systems of the creatures from C3/DS were retained and updated for the 3D environment.&lt;ref name=Walou&gt;{{cite news|last=Walou|first=Eddie|title=Des norns, des neurones, et des euros|newspaper=[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]|pages=50–51|language=French| date=November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=195&amp;p=1698#p1698 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518095035/http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=195&amp;p=1698 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 May 2016 |title=Forum • View topic - the 3d... whats up with it |publisher=Creatures Online Official Site |author=Di Stefano, Andrea |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Norns' fur patterns were to be partially [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]], with the goal of ensuring "that no two Norns look alike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2013/01/22/creatures-4-dev-update-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Creatures 4 Dev Update: The Light at the End of the Tunnel |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Heterochromia iridum]] has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2013/03/22/creatures-4-procedural-fur-patterns/ |title=Fishing Cactus development blog » Blog Archive » Creatures 4 : Procedural Fur Patterns |publisher=Blog.fishingcactus.com |date=2013-03-22 |accessdate=2013-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The norns of Creatures Online will have a new [[drive theory|drive]], tentatively called "[[Altruism in animals|altruism]]", which encourages them to do things which will benefit the norn colony, like tending to plants and fixing broken toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=303&amp;p=2423#p2423 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029183951/http://creatures-online.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=303&amp;p=2423 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 October 2013 |author=Di Stefano, Andrea |title=Forum • View topic - PGW 2012 Demo Video |publisher=Creatures Online Official Site |date=24 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Creatures 4" was renamed "Creatures Online" in May 2013.&lt;ref name="CreaturesOnline"/&gt;  Creatures Online, unlike earlier entries in the Creatures series,&lt;ref name="facebook2013"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Mika, Andrea di Stefano, Samuel Languy |year=2013 |title=Aug 24, 2013 5:55am  |medium=Interview  |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10201731082140120 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |time=1.52 |publisher=Creatures Online |location=Facebook |quote= Samuel Languy: "A lot of players liked to play it but didn't really know what - 'Is it a game, is it not?'

===''Younger Children's Games'' (later re-released as ''Creatures Village'')===

====''Creatures Adventures''====
Released in 2000, and targeted at younger children (ages 6–9), ''Creatures Adventures'' dropped the complex interface of the main series in favour of brighter graphics and a more childlike atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=James|title=Creatures Adventures|journal=[[PC Zone]]|date=1999|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Creatures Playground''====
The second game in the younger children's series, ''Creatures Playground'' (released the same year), could be connected to Adventures to create an even bigger world to explore.  It has a theme park for the creatures, including mini-games like whack-a-mole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schofield|first1=Jack|author-link=Jack Schofield (journalist)|title=Games reviews|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/nov/16/onlinesupplement4|date=16 November 2000 |accessdate=6 August 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Console games===
The ''Creatures'' concept was made into three different games for consoles: ''[[Creatures (Game Boy Advance game)|Creatures]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and ''[[Creatures (PlayStation game)|Creatures]]'' and ''[[Creatures: Raised in Space]]'' for [[PlayStation]].  In the PlayStation games, the hand is replaced by a [[fairy]] named Scrubby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roper|first=Chris|title=Creatures Review|url=http://ign.com/articles/2002/09/23/creatures-review|publisher=IGN |date=23 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the limited processing power of the early-day consoles, the [[AI]] had to be completely reprogrammed by the console development team around [[Volker Eloesser]]. A fourth, ''Project Loci'', was in development at the time of Creatures Labs' liquidation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicelytoasted.net/honey/archives/002107.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826062030/http://www.nicelytoasted.net/honey/archives/002107.html |archivedate=2003-08-26 |title=Portfolio: Creatures Project Loci |author=de Araujo, Lisa |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-08-26 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled for lack of funds.  ''Loci'' would have been the first ''Creatures'' game for the PS2, Xbox and GameCube.

==Later bundled releases==
There have been various re-releases of the ''Creatures'' games. The later re-releases from Gameware improved Windows XP compatibility by allowing them to run easily under non-administrator accounts and without the use of the  compatibility mode, but break compatibility with some third-party content without the use of a third-party patch.

;''Creatures Trilogy'' / ''Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection''
This release of ''Creatures Trilogy'' included ''Creatures'', ''Creatures 2'', and ''Creatures 3'', as well as the ''Life Kit'' addons for the earlier games. It was released before ''Docking Station'', but the version of ''Creatures 3'' included in this was identical to the original release (except that it was using the newest patch) and was therefore compatible with ''Docking Station''.

Encore Software released a ''Creatures Trilogy'' containing ''Creatures'', ''Creatures 2'', and ''Creatures 3'',&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/print.php?id=468_0_10_0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105173924/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/print.php?id=468_0_10_0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-01-05 |title=GameWare Development |publisher=GameWare Development |date=2003-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; under their [[Encare]] line. They also released a "gold" version titled ''Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection''.

;''Creatures Internet Edition'' / ''Creatures Gold''
The final major ''Creatures'' release was a re-release in 2001 by FastTrak Software Publishing as ''Creatures Internet Edition'', a bundle of ''Creatures 3'', ''Creatures 3 Update 2'', ''Docking Station'', and a number of environment extras and tools (many with multilingual variants).&lt;ref name="gamewaredevelopment2"/&gt; [[Linux Game Publishing]] released a Linux port of ''Creatures Internet Edition'' a few months later in December 2001.

The original ''Creatures Internet Edition'' was released again in 2002 by [[Focus Multimedia]], without the physical manual, as ''Creatures Gold'', but the disc contents were identical (and so the installer and PDF manual both referred to it as ''Creatures Internet Edition'').

;''Creatures: The Albian Years''
''Creatures 1'' and ''[[Creatures 2]]'' on one disk, updated to run on Windows XP.

;''Creatures Exodus''
''[[Creatures 3]]'' and ''Docking Station'' plus a selection of new Norn breeds on one disk, updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110517015344/http://www.gamewaredevelopment.com/ds/ds_more.php?id=552_0_16_0_C free downloadable] versions are also available.

;''Creatures Village''
''Creatures Adventures'' and ''Creatures Playground'', merged and updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format versions are also available.

;''Creatures Triple Collection''
''Creatures Triple Pack'', otherwise known as ''Creatures Collection: Triple'', contains ''The Albian Years'', ''Creatures Exodus'' and ''Creatures Village'' for Windows.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2013}}
As of September 2017, the Creatures Community, or CC, is still very active online and in the games;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creaturescaves.com/index.php|title=Creatures Caves {{!}} Home |last=Rascii|website=creaturescaves.com|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the Community holds a festival called the Creatures Community Spirit Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creatures.org.uk/ccsf/|title=Creatures Community Spirit Festival|website=www.creatures.org.uk|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or CCSF, to celebrate the games and the community that has formed since the creation of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denton|first1=Abby|title=Artificial life finds a way: the legacy of Creatures|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/12/creatures-fans-mods-artificial-life/|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players have always ranged in age and the enthusiasm for the games is still very high.

Several reviews of the series emphasise that the player will need patience,&lt;ref name="CNETreview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rita Courtney |url=http://www.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r12597.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010701213611/http://www.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r12597.htm |archivedate=2001-07-01 |title=GameZone.com - PC Game Reviews - Creatures 3 |publisher=Web.archive.org |year=2000 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hubble1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubble|first=Calvin|title=Creatures Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/creatures|publisher=Game Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fielder |first=Lauren |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/creatures-2-review/1900-2538465/ |title=Creatures 2 Review |publisher=GameSpot |date=1998-11-13 |accessdate=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommend it for players who are not parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leonard |first=Andrew |title=The Game of Life |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/streetcred_pr.html |work=Street Cred |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127023401/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.02/streetcred_pr.html |archivedate=November 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgameplay.co.uk/reviews/puzzle/creatures3.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20010508111713/http://www.pcgameplay.co.uk/reviews/puzzle/creatures3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-05-08 |title=Creatures 3 |date=2001-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early games do not have specific goals,&lt;ref name="facebook2013"/&gt; leading some reviewers to consider it a 'small scale genetic experiment' rather than a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=May 1997|title=Creatures|pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer compares the game to a virtual '[[fish tank]]', feeling that once the frustration of raising norns through their childhood was over and a breeding population had been established, the game became boring for him.&lt;ref name="cdmag2003"/&gt;

Several reviewers compared Creatures favourably to [[Tamagotchi]] when Creatures first came out.&lt;ref name="hubble1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alderman |first=John |title=Tamagotchi, Schmamagotchi: Here Come the Norns |url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/05/3639 |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |date=6 May 1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013456/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/05/3639 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Caroline Daniel]], it is intriguing what our interactions with the game will reveal about us.  Furthermore, Daniel regarded the game as an important step in popularising artificial life technology in the home.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Caroline. "Little life forms to call your own." ''[[New Statesman]]'' 15 Nov. 1996: 12. Literature Resource Center. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July and November 1997, over 100,000 copies of ''Creatures'' were sold in the American market. ''[[Windows Sources]]'' magazine gave the series a "Stellar Award".&lt;ref&gt;"Creatures Sells 100,000 Copies in Less Than 100 Days, Virtual Life Sim from Mindscape Continues to Fly off the Shelves." ''[[Business Wire]]'' 3 Nov. 1997: 11030074. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Schindler wondered if this game was entertainment or a simulation of parenthood.  Schindler criticised the inability to scroll all the way around the world.  Schindler also noted that raising a group of norns was much more difficult than raising a single norn, as they could interact with each other with much greater ease than he could interact with a norn.&lt;ref name=Schindler&gt;Schindler, Jay. "CREATURES." ''[[Simulation &amp; Gaming]]'' 29.4 (1998): 482. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Labriola wrote of ''Creatures'' that "no other program so successfully mirrors the joys and challenges of raising a child or pet."&lt;ref&gt;Labriola, Don. "Mindscape's Creatures brings artificial life to your desktop." ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'' Nov. 1997: 290. General OneFile. Web. 12 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the ''Creatures'' series was featured by an academic study into science-themed video games as depicting an accurate model of evolution and natural selection, displaying three key features of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leith|first1=Alex|title=Playing a science-based video game?

'''''Creatures 2''''' is the second game in the [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]] [[artificial life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]], and the sequel to 1996 game ''[[Creatures (artificial life series)|Creatures]]''. It features three species: the cute, dependent [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Norns]], the cantankerous [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Grendel]]s and the industrious [[Creatures (artificial life program)|Ettins]]. The game tries to simulate life, and includes a complex two-dimensional ecology of plants, animals and insects, which provide the environment for the three main species to live and develop in.  The player interacts with the world using a hand-shaped cursor, and tries to encourage the creatures' development by manipulating various objects around the world, guiding the creatures using the cursor and encouraging the creatures to speak.

Many new gameplay features included in Creatures 2 not present in the original game include a new [[physics]] model and a global weather system, along with brand new applets and a world twice the size of the Creatures 1 world.

The [[executable]] file for the game was in fact an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for its scripting [[Programming language|language]], thus allowing users to make total conversions or derivative works from the game.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

== Gameplay ==
Like the other games in the series, Creatures 2 is mostly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, allowing the player to raise Norns at their own pace. In each new world, the player begins in the [[Incubator (egg)|incubator]] cavern area. The [[hatchery]], one of the game's in-built applets, allows the player to add Norn eggs to the world, which can be hatched via the incubator. Norns may also be downloaded from the internet and imported into to use in the game.

Once Norns reach [[adolescence]] at around an hour old, they are ready to breed, and female Norns will begin an [[oestrogen]] cycle. When Norns mate, there is a long kissing sound with a pop at the end – known as a kisspop. Like real life, not all mating results in a pregnancy. The Norn reproductive process can be monitored via the Breeder's Kit.

At the beginning, the player is only able to navigate a small area of Albia. As their Norns explore the world, however, more areas will be able to visited. If a Norn falls into water and is picked up, it cannot be placed in an unvisited area.

Like the previous game, every plant, animal and insect in Albia is a separate system called an autonomous agent, or just "agent" for short. Many user-created agents have been made, which can be injected into the world using the Injector Kit applet, which also includes an analysis page giving the opportunity  to check new objects for potentially harmful contents before injecting them.

Albia, the world in which Creatures 2 is set, is a vast disc-world filled with a wide variety of flora, ranging from the Cacti that inhabit the desert to the exclusive mushroom-like Gelsemium plant that can only be found in a single cavern. Albia is also home to a substantial amount of animal life, such as [[bee]]s which pollinate [[flower]]s and create [[honey]], and Zander fish, which provide a food source for creatures near the oceans. Scattered throughout the world are various seed launchers, which can be used to replenish stocks if any life-forms become extinct.

Albia also has four seasons: [[Spring (season)|Spring]], [[Summer]], [[Winter]] and [[Autumn]], and boasts its very own climate, with weather such as snow mainly occurring during the colder months, and rain mostly during the Spring. The game also has an on-screen [[thermometer]], allowing the player to monitor Albia's temperature at all times.

== Development ==
Creatures 2's release was widely anticipated. It is likely that around 450,000 copies of the original Creatures had been sold by the time the game was released, and a huge following had developed behind it. The "Early Adoption Program", a promotion where 250 copies of Creatures 2 were given away prior to its official release in September 1998, was scheduled to begin in July 1998, but was pushed back as the game was not close to release quality at the point at which the EAP was scheduled to start. In the end, most received their copies several weeks after the release date.

Upon release, the game suffered from numerous flaws, such as a deficient Norn genome that lead to a condition dubbed "One Hour Stupidity Syndrome (OHSS)", which caused Norns to forgot basic survival skills such as eating and sleeping. The task of creating the new Norn genome was given to Sandra Linkletter (Slink), who was also a member of the Creatures community. During development, many problems emerged, most likely due to disagreements between Slink and the Creatures 2 team. Slink later claimed that her design had been compromised by the geneticist brought on to finish her work, Eric Goodwin, and later accused Cyberlife of deriving their update from hers.

Cyberlife later released a patch with an improved genome after several weeks had passed. Several users also created improved Norn genomes, such as the Canny Norn genome created by Chris Double and Lis Morris.

'''Critterding''' is an artificial life simulator created by Bob Winckelmans and released as open source under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

== Simulation ==
Critterding is a 3D/Physics based simulator, in which critters try to survive by developing a form of locomotion, find food and reproduce. Critters are made up of two types of body parts which are linked together by joints. The head, coloured red, is where the vision and mouth is located. The body segments are used for locomotion and display the colour of the critter. On an initial run, random seed critters are generated in a food rich environment, eventually a seed critter is generated that is able to eat and reproduce before dying. The new offspring have a chance to receive a mutation to either the body or neural network, some of which will be detrimental, causing the critter to fail and die while other mutations will be beneficial allowing it and its offspring to flourish over their siblings. Once the critter population reaches a preset maximum, the population is halved and the available food in the system is slightly reduced.

== Vision ==
Critters see with a 16 x 16 retina grid by default, though this value may be changed. Each pixel in the grid is able to see red, green, blue and alpha channels.

== Environment ==
Critterding supports 2 main environment types. A tray/petri dish style flatworld with walls to keep critters from falling into the void and the roundworld environment where critters and food are held on with planet like gravity. Beta 14 introduces .obj loading for fully customisable terrain, critter and food skins, skydome and dynamic lighting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7534">'''Dataism''' is a term that has been used to describe the mindset or philosophy created by the emerging significance of [[Big data|Big Data]]. It was first used by [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the term has been expanded to describe what social scientist [[Yuval Noah Harari]] has called an emerging ideology or even a new form of religion, in which 'information flow' is the 'supreme value'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
"If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is Data-ism", wrote [[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] in the New York Times in February 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Philosophy of Data|last=Brooks|first=David|date=2013-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in a world of increasing complexity, relying on data can reduce cognitive biases and "illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed".

In 2015, Steve Lohr's book 'Data-ism' looked at how Big Data is transforming society, using the term to describe the Big Data revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/you-can-run-from-big-data-but-can-you-hide/2015/03/20/082ea46c-c805-11e4-a199-6cb5e63819d2_story.html|title=You can run from Big Data, but can you hide?|last=Igo|first=Sarah E.|date=2015-03-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861210012|title=Data-ism : The Revolution Transforming Decision Making, Consumer Behavior, and Almost Everything Else|last=Lohr|first=Steve|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=May 2015|isbn=0062226819|edition=First|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=861210012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development by Harari ===
In his 2016 book, [[Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|Homo Deus]], [[Yuval Noah Harari]] takes the idea of Dataism further, putting it into a historical context. He argues that all competing political or social structures can be seen as data processing systems: "Dataism declares that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hilbert_InfoGrowth.png|thumb|Harari expands on the term: A Dataist is someone that trusts Big Data (above) and computer algorithms, in preference to human knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953597984|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2017|publisher=Vintage|year=|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=429|oclc=953597984}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Harari posits that "we may interpret the entire human species as a single data processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage, Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then argues that the whole of human history can be read as a process of improving the efficiency of this system by increasing the number and variety of processors/chips (humans) in the system, increasing the number of connections between the processors and increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. A condensed form of this argument can be read in Harari's Wired article from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yuval-noah-harari-dataism|title='Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm': Yuval Noah Harari on how data could eat the world|last=Harari|first=Yuval|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari goes on to argue that Dataism, like any other religion, has practical commandments. A Dataist should want to "maximise dataflow by connecting to more and more media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=Vintage Penguin Random House|year=2017|isbn=9781784703936|location=UK|pages=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and believes that freedom of information is "the greatest good of all". Harari also argues that [[Aaron Swartz]], who took his life in 2013 after being prosecuted for releasing hundreds of thousands of scientific papers from the [[JSTOR]] archive online for free, could be called the "first martyr" of Dataism.

Writing in the Financial Times, Harari argued that Dataism presents an existential challenge to the dominant moral ideology of Humanism, which sees human feelings as the ultimate authority in the world: "humanism is now facing an existential challenge and the idea of “free will” is under threat... Once Big Data systems know me better than I know myself, authority will shift from humans to algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|date=2016-08-26|website=Financial Times|access-date=2018-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harari predicts that the logical conclusion of this process is that eventually humans will give algorithms the authority to make the most important decisions in their lives, such as who to marry and which career to pursue.

== Criticism ==
Commenting on Harari's characterisation of Dataism, security analyst Daniel Miessler believes that Dataism does not present the challenge to the ideology of liberal humanism that Harari claims, because humans will simultaneously be able to believe in their own importance and that of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://danielmiessler.com/blog/some-thoughts-on-dataism/|title=Some Thoughts on Dataism|date=2017-04-07|work=Daniel Miessler|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harari himself raises some criticisms, such as the problem of consciousness, which Dataism is unlikely to illuminate.

'''''Evolution''''' is a collection of short stories that work together to form an episodic [[science fiction]] novel by author [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]].  It follows 565 million years of human evolution, from [[shrewlike]] mammals 65 million years in the past to the ultimate fate of humanity (and its descendants, both biological and non-biological) 500 million years in the future.

==Plot summary==
The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving [[Purgatorius]] into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) [[New World]] on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on [[Antarctica]].

The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. At one point, hominids become [[Sapience|sapient]], and go on to develop technology, including an evolving [[universal assembler|universal constructor]] machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of [[global ecophagy]]  consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. [[Human extinction]] (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet.  (The [[extinction-level event]] that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the [[Rabaul caldera]], coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in ''Evolution'' are ponderous Romans, sapient [[dinosaur]]s, the last of the wild [[Neanderthal]]s, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, [[symbiotic]] primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. The final chapter witnesses the final fate of the last primate and the descendants of the replicator machines sent to [[Mars]] that are implied to have reached sentience and colonized the galaxy.
In the epilogue, Joan Useb (a paleontologist introduced in the prologue and in the intermission sections) discusses the philosophy of evolution with her daughter Lucy as they weather the aftermath of Rabaul on the [[Galapagos]], where [[Charles Darwin]] made his observations leading to his landmark theory.

==Reception==
[[Peter Cannon]] reviewing for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "here is a rigorously constructed hard SF novel where the question is not whether humanity will reach the stars but how it will survive its own worst tendencies."&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Peter|date=January 20, 2003|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 250|issue= 3|pages=61|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called this novel "glum, dyspeptic, and depressing."&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 15, 2002|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Kirkus Reviews|volume= 70|issue= 22,|pages=1662|issn=0042-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie Cassada said in her review for ''[[Library Journal]]'' that "spanning more than 165 million years and encompassing the entire planet, Baxter's ambitious saga provides both an exercise in painless paleontology and superb storytelling."&lt;ref name="Cassada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassada|first=Jackie |date=February 15, 2003|title=Evolution (Book)|journal=Library Journal|volume= 128|issue= 3|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Evolution'' has been compared to [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Last and First Men]]'' and Baxter has acknowledged Stapledon's influence.&lt;ref name="AberrantDreams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd-image.com/interviews/myles_cabot_07.htm|title=An Interview with Stephen Baxter|work=Aberrant Dreams|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''faked death''', also called a "staged death" and '''pseudocide''',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livescience.com/22473-faking-death-crime-law.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201704/pseudocide-the-art-faking-your-death|title=Pseudocide: The Art of Faking Your Death|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/es/diccionario/ingles/pseudocide|title=Pseudocide definición y significado - Diccionario Inglés Collins|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a case in which an individual leaves evidence to suggest that they are [[death|dead]] to mislead others. This is done for a variety of reasons, such as to [[fraud]]ulently collect [[insurance]] money or to avoid capture by law enforcement for some other crime.

People who fake their own deaths sometimes do so by pretend [[drowning]]s, because it provides a plausible reason for the [[Declared death in absentia|absence of a body]].

There are several how-to books on the subject of faking one's death, including ''[[How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found]]''.

==Notable faked deaths==
* [[John Stonehouse]], a British politician who faked his own [[suicide]] by drowning to escape financial difficulties and live with his mistress. He was discovered in [[Australia]] - where police initially thought he might be [[Richard Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] - and jailed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*[[Timothy Dexter|"Lord" Timothy Dexter]], an eccentric 18th-century New England businessman who faked his own death to see how people would react. His wife did not shed any tears at the wake, and as a result he caned her for not being sufficiently saddened at his passing.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, William Cleaves ''Timothy Dexter.'' Boston, Massachusetts: David Clapp &amp; Son., 1886: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Darwin disappearance case|John Darwin]], a former teacher and prison officer from [[Hartlepool]], [[England]] faked his own death on 21 March 2002 by canoeing out to sea and disappearing. His ruse fell apart in 2006 when a simple Google search revealed a photo of him buying a house in Panama.
*[[Marcus Schrenker]], a financial manager from [[Fishers, Indiana]], was charged with defrauding clients, and attempted to fake his own death to avoid prosecution.  He was captured following a multi-state, three-day manhunt.
*[[Samuel Israel III]], an [[United States|American]] [[hedge fund]] manager who was facing twenty years in prison for fraud, left his car and a suicide note on the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] in an attempted fake suicide in 2008. He later surrendered himself to authorities. It was always suspected that his suicide was faked since, among other things, passersby reported that a car had picked someone up on the bridge from near Israel's abandoned car.
*Charles Mulet, a corrupt Louisiana policeman, had been accused of molesting a teenage girl in 1988. Mulet left his truck alongside a bridge and sent a note to his police department. The suicide was ruled inconclusive after police failed to find a corpse in the river, and a hiker reported to police a man opening fire on him without warning, whose description matched Mulet's. The case being profiled on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' led to Mulet's capture.
*[[David Friedland]], a former New Jersey senator, faked his own death via scuba-diving accident in 1985 while awaiting trial on racketeering charges.
*[[Francisco Paesa]], agent of [[Centro Nacional de Inteligencia]], the [[Spanish secret service]]. In 1998 he faked a fatal cardiac arrest in Thailand, after tricked [[Luis Roldán]], known for being the general of the [[Spanish Civil Guard]] when a big scandal of corruption arose in 1993, into stealing all the money that Roldán had previously stolen in that case. He appeared in 2004. During these years, he opened an offshore company, as it was exposed thanks to [[Panama Papers]].
*[[Arkady Babchenko]], a Russian journalist living in Ukraine who in 2018 faked his own assassination, which was widely reported in the international press, as part of a sting operation aimed at exposing an agent sent to kill him. Babchenko's appearance at a press conference the day after his "death" caused an international sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Murdered' Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko is alive |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44307611 |accessdate=30 May 2018 |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explains that he survived the fall where Moriarty did not, but had to remain "officially" dead while Moriarty's lieutenant, [[Sebastian Moran]], was still at large.  [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] originally intended Holmes's "death" in ''[[The Final Problem]]'' to be the conclusion of the Holmes stories, but was persuaded by fan pressure to "resurrect" the character.

'''Flocking''' behavior is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a [[Flock (birds)|flock]], are [[foraging]] or in flight. There are parallels with the [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] behavior of fish, the [[swarm]]ing behavior of insects, and [[herd behavior]] of land animals.

Computer simulations and mathematical models which have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviors of birds can generally be applied also to the "flocking" behavior of other species. As a result, the term "flocking" is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds.

This article is about the modelling of flocking behavior. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, "flocking" is the collective motion of a large number of self-propelled entities and is a [[collective animal behavior]] exhibited by many living beings such as [[flock (birds)|bird]]s, [[fish]], [[bacteria]], and  [[insect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= O'Loan |first= OJ |last2= Evans |first2= MR |year= 1999|title= Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking |url= https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002/meta |journal= Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General |publisher= IOP Publishing |volume= 32 |issue= 8 |pages= L99 |doi= 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode= 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an [[emergence|emergent]] behavior arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.

Flocking behavior was simulated on a computer in 1987 by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] with his simulation program, [[Boids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
|author= Reynolds, Craig W.
|title= Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model.
|booktitle= ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics
|volume=21 |issue=4 |pages= 25–34
|year=1987
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple agents (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The result is akin to a [[Flock (birds)|flock]] of [[bird]]s, a [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] of [[fish]], or a [[swarm]] of [[insects]].

==Flocking rules==

Basic models of flocking behavior are controlled by three simple rules:

#Separation - avoid crowding neighbours (short range repulsion)
#Alignment - steer towards average heading of neighbours
#Cohesion - steer towards average position of neighbours (long range attraction)

With these three simple rules, the flock moves in an extremely realistic way, creating complex motion and interaction that would be extremely hard to create otherwise.

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et al.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Delgado-Mata C, Ibanez J, Bee S|display-authors=etal |title= On the use of Virtual Animals with Artificial Fear in Virtual Environments 
|journal= New Generation Computing
|volume=25 |issue=2 |pages= 145–169
|year=2007
|doi= 10.1007/s00354-007-0009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. Hartman and Benes
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Hartman C, Benes B |title= Autonomous boids 
|journal= Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds

|year=2006
|doi= 10.1002/cav.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the bird to become a leader and try to escape.
Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Hemelrijk, C. K. |author2=Hildenbrandt, H. |title= Some Causes of the Variable Shape of Flocks of Birds
|journal=PLOS ONE
|volume=6 |issue=8 |year=2011
|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 |pages=e22479 |pmid=21829627 |pmc=3150374|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622479H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
used attraction, alignment and avoidance and extended this with a number of traits of real starlings: first, birds fly according to fixed wing aerodynamics, while rolling when turning (thus losing lift); second, they coordinate with a limited number of interaction neighbours of 7 (like real starlings); third, they try to stay above a sleeping site (like starlings do at dawn), and when they happen to move outwards from the sleeping site, they return to it by turning; fourth, they move at relative fixed speed. The authors showed that the specifics of flying behaviour as well as large flocksize and low number of interaction partners were essential to the creation of the variable shape of flocks of starlings.

== Measurement ==
Measurements of bird flocking have been made&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last =Feder | first =Toni |date=October 2007 | title =Statistical physics is for the birds | journal = Physics Today| volume =60 | issue =10 | pages =28–30 | id = | url = | accessdate = | doi =10.1063/1.2800090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using high-speed cameras, and a computer analysis has been made to test the simple rules of flocking mentioned above. It is found that they generally hold true in the case of bird flocking, but the long range attraction rule (cohesion) applies to the nearest 5-10 neighbors of the flocking bird and is independent of the distance of these neighbors from the bird. In addition, there is an [[anisotropy]] with regard to this cohesive tendency, with more cohesion being exhibited towards neighbors to the sides of the bird, rather than in front or behind. This is no doubt due to the field of vision of the flying bird being directed to the sides rather than directly forward or backward.

Another recent study is based on an analysis of high speed camera footage of flocks above Rome, and uses a computer model assuming minimal behavioural rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hildenbrandt | first1 = H | last2 = Carere | first2 = C | last3 = Hemelrijk | first3 = CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemelrijk | first1 = CK | last2 = Hildenbrandt | first2 = H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index Project Starflag]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk Swarm behaviour model by University of Groningen]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithmic complexity==
In flocking simulations, there is no central control; each bird behaves autonomously. In other words, each bird has to decide for itself which flocks to consider as its environment. Usually environment is defined as a circle (2D) or sphere (3D) with a certain radius (representing reach).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

A basic implementation of a flocking algorithm has complexity &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; - each bird searches through all other birds to find those which fall into its environment.{{synthesis-inline|date=March 2018}}

Possible improvements:{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* bin-[[Square lattice|lattice]] spatial subdivision. Entire area the flock can move in is divided into a large number of bins. Each bin stores which birds it contains. Each time a bird moves from one bin to another, lattice has to be updated.

Lee Spector, Jon Klein, Chris Perry and [[Mark Feinstein]] studied the emergence of collective behavior in evolutionary computation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hampshire.edu/lspector/gecco2003-collective.html | author=Spector, L. |author2=Klein, J. |author3=Perry, C. |author4= Feinstein, M.  | year=2003 | title=Emergence of Collective Behavior in Evolving Populations of Flying Agents | work=Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2003) | publisher=Springer-Verlag | accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Chazelle]] proved that under the assumption that each bird adjusts its velocity and position to the other birds within a fixed radius, the time it takes to converge to a steady state is an iterated exponential of height logarithmic in the number of birds. This means that if the number of birds is large enough, the convergence time will be so great that it might as well be infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Chazelle, ''The Convergence of Bird Flocking'', J. ACM 61 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This result applies only to convergence to a steady state. For example, arrows fired into the air at the edge of a flock will cause the whole flock to react more rapidly than can be explained by interactions with neighbors, which are slowed down by the time delay in the bird's central nervous systems—bird-to-bird-to-bird.

In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated a flock-like behavior in humans. The group of people exhibited a very similar behavioral pattern to that of a flock, where if 5% of the flock would change direction the others would follow suit. When one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish.&lt;ref&gt;"http://psychcentral.com/news/2008/02/15/herd-mentality-explained/1922.html".

Flocking has also been considered as a means of controlling the behavior of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).&lt;ref&gt;Senanayake, M., Senthooran, I., Barca, J.

{{About|the feet stance|the Disney character|Goofy}}

'''Footedness''' is the natural preference of one's left or right [[foot]] for various purposes. It is the foot equivalent of [[handedness]]. While purposes vary, such as applying the greatest force in a certain foot to complete the action of kick as opposed to stomping, footedness is most commonly associated with the preference of a particular foot in the leading position while engaging in foot, or kicking related sports, such as [[association football]] and [[kickboxing]].

==In [[ball games]]==
In [[football]], the ball is predominately struck by the foot. Footedness may refer to the foot a player uses to kick with the greatest force and skill. Most people are right-footed, kicking with the right leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=BRW|volume=29|issue=28–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDK3AAAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Business Review Weekly|page=26|quote=...a skilful left-footer (a rare trait in soccer), his services are sure to be in demand.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capable left-footed footballers are rare and therefore quite sought after. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=David|title=Successful soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmBohI1ee5gC|year=1990|publisher=Sackville|isbn=978-0-948615-31-3|page=40|quote=As a natural left-sided player, you'll already know how rare you are as a footballer — and how valuable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As rare are "two-footed" players, who are equally capable with both feet. Such players make up only one sixth of players in the top professional leagues in Europe.&lt;ref name=CEPDiscuss&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0948.pdf | title=The Returns to Scarce Talent: Footedness and Player Remuneration in European Soccer | author=Bryson, Alex | journal=CEP Discussion Papers |date=September 2009  | volume=#948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-footedness can be learnt, a notable case being England international [[Tom Finney]], but can only be properly developed in the early years.&lt;ref name=CEPDiscuss/&gt; In [[Australian rules football|Australian Rules Football]], several players are equally adept at using both feet to kick the ball, such as [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]] and Charles Bushnell (footballer, retired).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/sam-mitchell-uses-his-non-preferred-foot-more-than-any-other-afl-footballer/story-e6frf3e3-1227393226605&lt;/ref&gt; In [[basketball]], a sport composed almost solely of right-handed players, it is common for most athletes to have a dominant left leg which they would use when jumping to complete a right-hand layup&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com/articles/performance-comparison-of-the-right-and-left-basketball-layup-in-hand-and-foot-ipsilateral-and-contralateral-conditions.pdf|title=Performance comparison of the right and left basketball lay-up in hand and foot ipsilateral and contralateral conditions|last=Aftabi|first=Gholam|date=2011|website=Scholar's Research Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, left handed basketball players tend to use their right leg more as they finish a left handed layup (although both right and left handed players are usually able to use both hands when finishing near the basket). 

In the [[National Football League]], a disproportionate, and increasing, number of [[punter (football)|punters]] punt with their left leg, where punting is the position in play that receives and kicks the ball once it leaves the line of scrimmage. At the end of the [[2017 NFL season]], 10 out of the league's 32 punters were left-footed, up from four out of 31 (not counting dual-footed punter [[Chris Hanson (American football)|Chris Hanson]], who left the league in 2009) at the beginning of the millennium; in contrast, [[placekicker]]s were almost exclusively right-footed. The only apparent advantage to punting with the left foot is because it is not as common, [[return specialist]]s are not as experienced handling the ball spinning in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/punting-takes-a-left-turn/ar-BBIfW9V?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=AARDHP|title=Punting Takes a Left Turn |first=Jenny|last=Vrentas|work=Sports Illustrated|date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In [[boardsport]]==
In boardsports, such as surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding, one must stand erect on a single, lightweight object that slides along the ground or on water. The need for balance causes one to position the body perpendicular to the direction of motion, with one foot leading the other. As with handedness, when this task is repetitively performed, one tends to naturally choose a particular foot for the leading position.

Boardsport riders are "footed" in one of two stances, generally called "regular" and "goofy". Riders will generally quickly choose a preferred stance that becomes permanently preferred. A "regular" stance indicates the left foot leading and a "Goofy" leads with the right. Professionals seem to be evenly distributed between the stances, as in the case of Luke Hopkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/edge/2015/11/12/tech-talk-boarding-onewheel-on-land-sport|title=Onewheel offering board riders a new on-land sport|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practice can yield a high level of [[ambidexterity]] between the two stances, such that even seasoned participants of a boardsport have difficulty discerning the footedness of an unfamiliar rider in action.
 
To increase the difficulty, variety, and aesthetic value of tricks, riders can ride "switch stance" (abbreviated to "switch"). For example, a goofy-footed skateboarder normally performs an [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]] with the right foot forward, but a "switch ollie" would have the rider standing with the left foot at the front of the board. In sports where switch riding is common and expected, like [[street skateboarding]], riders have the goal of appearing natural at, and performing the same tricks in, both regular and goofy stances. Some sports like [[kitesurfing]] and [[windsurfing]] generally require the rider to be able to switch stance depending on the wind or travel direction rather than rider preference. Each time direction is changed, the stance changes. Snowboarders who ride switch may adopt a "duck stance", where the feet are mounted turned out, or pointed away from the mid-line of the body, typically at a roughly 15 degree angle. In this position, the rider will have the leading foot facing forward in either regular or switch stance.

===Switch, Fakie and Nollie===
When a rider rolls backwards, this is called "riding [[fakie]]". A "fakie" trick is performed while riding backwards but taking off on the front foot. Although it is the same foot that jumps in one's traditional stance, it is normally the back foot. A rider can also land in the fakie position. While there are some parallels between switch stance and fakie, riding switch implies opening the shoulders more to face the direction headed, though not as much as in traditional stance, while fakie stance implies a slightly more backwards facing, closed shoulder posture. '[[Nollie]]' (nose ollie) is when the front foot takes off when one is riding in their normal stance, the same foot that jumps when doing tricks switch. In nollie position, the body and shoulders are facing forward as much as when riding in normal stance. Generally switch and nollie are done off the nose, whereas normal and fakie are done off the tail. 

In skateboarding, most tricks are performed riding backwards — with respect to the rider's preferred stance — are exclusively categorized as "switch" (in a switch stance) or as fakie, with the general rule that tricks off the [[List of skateboarding terms#Board parts|tail]] are almost always described as fakie, and those off the nose are nollie. For example, a jump using the tail rolling backwards is a "fakie [[Ollie (skateboarding)|ollie]]" (not a "switch nollie"), and a jump off the nose is a "nollie" (not a "fakie nollie").

====Mongo foot====
Mongo foot refers to the use of the rider's front foot for pushing. Normally, a skateboarder will feel more with comfortable using their back foot to push, while their front foot remains on the board. In the minority case of mongo-footed skateboarders, the opposite is true. Some skateboarders who don't push mongo in their regular stance may still push mongo when riding in switch stance, rather than push with their weaker back foot. Some well-known skaters who change between mongo and normal when pushing switch include Jacob Vance, [[Stevie Williams]], and [[Eric Koston]].

Although its origins remain uncertain, it is widely believed the term is a pejorative reference to the band [[Mungo Jerry|Mungo Jerry]].

==BMX==
In [[BMX]], there is a de facto relationship between footedness and preferences of grinding position and of mid-air turning direction. The terms "regular" and "goofy" do not indicate a foot preference as in boardsports, but rather they point out if the rider's footedness has the usual relationship with their grinding and mid-air turning preferences. For example, consider the following classes of riders:

* right-footed riders who prefer turning counter-clockwise in the air, and grinding on their right.
* left-footed riders who prefer turning clockwise in the air, and grinding on their left.

Both classes are of equal size and would be considered "regular". "Goofy" would describe riders whose trick preferences do not match their footedness: a rider who prefers to grind on the opposite side as do most is considered a "goofy grinder"; one who prefers to turn the opposite direction in mid-air as do most is considered a "goofy spinner". Few riders have either goofy trait, but some riders may have both. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://whitelines.com/archive/features/goofy-vs-regular-an-infographic.html|title=Goofy vs. Regular - The Infographic - Whitelines Snowboarding|work=Whitelines Snowboarding|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kickboxing, professional wrestling and MMA==
In many combat sports, most people have a more powerful kick with the same side as their handedness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'' ''' Les Dialogues d’Evhémère''' '' ('The Dialogues of [[Euhemerus]]') is a little-known philosophical dialogue by [[Voltaire]], published in 1777. At the time of its writing he was 83 years old and knew that he was coming to the end of his life:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"/&gt; the work is a kind of philosophical testament.  Like many other works by Voltaire, it is written in the tradition of Socratic dialogue, where the interlocutors seek the truth together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banderier |first1=Gilles |title=Voltaire en dialogues |journal=Acta fabula |date=May 2006 |volume=7 |issue=2 |url=http://www.fabula.org/acta/document1332.php |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
The imagined dialogue takes place between two historical figures, Euhemerus and Callicrates. Euhemerus, a [[Stoic]], was a contemporary of [[Alexander the Great]], remembered mostly for his view that the Classical Greek gods had originally been people, deified long after their deaths by their followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meurger |first1=Michel |title=Evhémère et les monstres. Croyances populaires et interprétation instruite |url=https://www.hommes-et-faits.com/lime/MMeurger_Monsters_.htm |website=Hommes et faits.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicrates was also a philosopher, from the third century BC, of whom little is known but whom Voltaire makes an [[Epicurean]]. His views, including [[atheism]], are meant to represent the views of Voltaire's contemporaries [[Holbach]], [[La Mettrie]] and [[Diderot]].

In the dialogue as in historic reality Euhemeros had enjoyed a life of travel, much of it following Alexander; Callicrates is curious to know what his friend has learned as a result of these experiences. The conversations that follow are set out in twelve dialogues:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vermeer-Pardoen |first1=Hannie |title=Voltaire De dialogen van Euhemeros Het nut van de filosofie |date=2017 |publisher=Gennep B.V., Uitgeverij Van |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-9461648594 |url=https://cbonline.boekhuis.nl/pls/cover/p_get_cover_fe?p_hash=0030284E59D1F5E446B902E37A7BB78D |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

}}

There are two main themes in the dialogues. The first six consider metaphysical questions such as whether we have a soul, whether God exists and, if he does, who is responsible for all the misery on earth. And the last six dialogues are about natural philosophy and the material world -  what we know about the cosmos, the earth, the creation of mountains, and the generation of new life. What all the dialogues have in common is an  appeal for modesty and restraint in argument. There is little we can undubitably know and much is hidden from us. For this reason, whatever we may believe, we should never ignore evidence or assumptions from outside the universe of our beliefs; rather than proclaiming dogmas we should engage in dialogue. At the same time, Euhemerus is unsparing in his attacks on atheists, atomists and materialists as well as on religious dogma - all of which he terms 'madness, misery and crime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Baar |first1=Marinus |title=Niets dan waanzin, ellende en misdaad |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/niets-dan-waanzin-ellende-en-misdaad~a275ddc5/ |website=trouw.nl |publisher=de Persgroep Nederland B.V. |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogues offer an overview of Voltaire's life of thought. Euhemerus is effectively Voltaire's mouthpiece; he has seen the follies, delusions and misery of mankind. Much of the dialogue focuses on paradox of God's goodness and the misery on earth. Euhemerus draws hope from scientific progress that points to a future world built on rationality. Eventually Callicrates decides to embark on a journey of his own to the barbarian lands from which his friend had learned so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dialogues d'Evhémère - Voltaire (1779) |url=https://www.boekmeter.nl/book/38450 |website=Boekmeter.nl |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and the first edition==
Voltaire's 94-page autographed manuscript still survives (pages 37–40 are not in his hand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receuil factice d'ouvrages et fragments autographes de Voltaire |url=http://w3public.ville-ge.ch/bge/volage.nsf/Attachments/ms01frameset.htm/$file/ms01.pdf |website=w3public.ville-ge.ch|publisher=Bibliothèque de Genève, Institut et Musée Voltaire |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Voltaire's surviving correspondence makes no reference to the work, its development, or the ideas it elaborates.&lt;ref name="Cairn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paillard |first1=Christophe |title=La correspondance de Voltaire et l’édition de ses œuvres. problème de méthodologie éditoriale |journal=Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France |date=2012 |volume=112 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.3917/rhlf.124.0859 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-histoire-litteraire-de-la-france-2012-4-page-859.htm |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]] does not mention it. The ''[[Mémoires secrets]]'' from November 1777 did refer to the work however, and a comment from [[Jean-Louis Wagnière]] indicated that the ''Dialogues'' had been published only shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oeuvres de Voltaire avec préfaces, avvertissement, notes ... par m. Beuchot: Mélanges. Tome 14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1WHuzF7XrQC&amp;pg=PA146|year=1834|publisher=Lefèvre|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his life Voltaire had had his works condemned or banned by royal censors in France on many occasions.  He also had a number of ways of avoiding censorship - including arranging for his work to be printed outside France, and having it printed anonymously so he could deny authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Birkenstock |first1=Jane |title=Château de Cirey, Residence of Voltaire |url=http://www.visitvoltaire.com/voltaire_bio.htm |website=www.visitvoltaire.com |publisher=Château de Cirey |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Davidson|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFU0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-68177-039-0|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the presentation of challenging or radical ideas in the form of a dialogue was one method of bringing unconventional ideas to public attention while being less likely to have the word altered or suppressed.&lt;ref name="Collins2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Daniel Collins|title=Interpreting Modern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6788-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece of the first known edition of the ''Dialogues d'Evhémère'' indicates that it was published in London by Voltaire not in 1777 as suggested by the ''Mémoires secrets'' but in 1779 (i.e. the year after Voltaire's death), but does not name a publisher.  In fact it is evident from the distinctive typography used that it was printed not in London but in [[Lausanne]], by Abraham-Louis Tarin, who worked for the publisher François Grasset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livre Dialogues d'Evhémère / par M. de Voltaire |url=https://explore.rero.ch/fr_CH/rero/result/L/VlRMU19SRVJPUjAwNDMzMzQ5NQ== |website=explore.rero.ch |publisher=Réseau des bibliothèques de Suisse occidentale |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasset is noted for having previously published a number of works attacking Voltaire as well as for having on several occasions clashed with him over the intended publication of Voltaire's works from unauthorised manuscript versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chatelard |first1=Marie-Claire |title=François GRASSET (1722-1789) |url=http://dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr/journaliste/359-francois-grasset |website=dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr |publisher=IHRIM UMR &amp; ISH USR |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lifestyle''' is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/lifestyle Lifestyle]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynn R. Kahle |author2=Angeline G. Close |title=Consumer Behavior Knowledge for Effective Sports and Event Marketing|year=2011|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-87358-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced by Austrian psychologist [[Alfred Adler]] with the meaning of "a person's basic character as established early in childhood",&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lifestyle Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; for example in his 1929 book "The Case of Miss R.". The broader sense of lifestyle as a "way or style of living" has been documented since 1961.&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"/&gt; Lifestyle is a combination of determining intangible or tangible factors. Tangible factors relate specifically to [[demographics|demographic]] variables, i.e. an individual's demographic profile, whereas intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such as personal values, preferences, and outlooks&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20.  https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 &lt;/ref&gt;.

A rural environment has different lifestyles compared to an urban [[metropolis]]. Location is important even within an urban scope.  The nature of the [[neighborhood]] in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person due to differences between various neighborhoods' degrees of affluence and proximity to natural and cultural environments&lt;ref&gt;Haenfler, R., Johnson, B., &amp; Jones, E. 2012 Lifestyle Movements: Exploring the Intersection of Lifestyle and Social Movements. Social Movement Studies, 11(1), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in areas within a close proximity to the sea, a [[surf culture]] or lifestyle can often be present.

==Individual identity==
A lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes, way of life, values, or [[world view]]. Therefore, a lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of [[Self-concept|self]] and to create cultural [[symbol]]s that resonate with personal identity&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, E., 2015. I was a teenage vegan: motivation and maintenance of lifestyle movements. Sociological Inquiry, 85(1), pp.55-74.&lt;/ref&gt;. Not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary. Surrounding social and technical systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the symbols she/he is able to project to others and the self.&lt;ref&gt;Spaargaren, G., and B. VanVliet (2000) "Lifestyle, Consumption and the Environment:  The Ecological Modernisation of Domestic Consumption", ''Environmental Politics'' 9(1): 50-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular lifestyle become blurred in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1991) ''Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age'', Cambridge: [[Polity Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "[[green lifestyle]]" means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources and produce less harmful waste (i.e. a smaller [[ecological footprint]]), and deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators argue that, in [[modernity]], the cornerstone of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior, which offers the possibility to create and further individualize the self with different products or services that signal different ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Ropke, I. (1999) "The Dynamics of Willingness to Consume", [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] 28: 399-420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle may include views on politics, religion, health, intimacy, and more. All of these aspects play a role in shaping someone's lifestyle.
&lt;ref&gt;Giuffrâe, K., &amp; DiGeronimo, T. (1999) ''Care and Feeding of Your Brain : How Diet and Environment Affect What You Think and Feel'', Career Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[magazine]] and [[television]] industries, "lifestyle" is used to describe a category of publications or programs.

==History of lifestyles studies==

Three main phases can be identified in the history of lifestyles studies:&lt;ref&gt;Berzano L., Genova C., Lifestyles and Subcultures. History and a New Perspective, Routledge, London, 2015 (Part I).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Lifestyles and social position: Earlier studies on lifestyles focus on the analysis of social structure and of the individuals’ relative positions inside it. [[Thorstein Veblen]], with his ‘emulation’ concept, opens this perspective by asserting that people adopt specific ‘schemes of life’, and in particular specific patterns of ‘conspicuous consumption’, depending on a desire for distinction from social strata they identify as inferior and a desire for emulation of the ones identified as superior. [[Max Weber]] intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly  connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige: the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation, even within the same social class, and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire. [[Georg Simmel]] carries out formal analysis of lifestyles, at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation, identification, differentiation, and recognition, understood both as generating processes of, and effects generated by, lifestyles, operating “vertically” as well as “horizontally”. Finally, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles, made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes, represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus.

;Lifestyles as styles of thought: The approach interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought has its roots in the soil of psychological analysis. Initially, starting with [[Alfred Adler]], a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality, in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives. Later, particularly in [[Milton Rokeach]]’s work, [[Arnold Mitchell]]’s VALS research and [[Lynn Kahle]]’s LOV research, lifestyles’ analysis developed as profiles of values, reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically, to which different population sectors correspond. Then with [[Daniel Yankelovich]] and [[William Wells (social scientist)|William Wells]] we move on to the so-called AIO approach in which attitudes, interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles’ components, being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context (as, for instance, in [[Bernard Cathelat]]’s work). Finally, a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach, at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables, bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action.

;Lifestyles as styles of action: Analysis of lifestyles as action profiles is characterized by the fact that it no longer considers the action level as a simple derivative of lifestyles, or at least as their collateral component, but rather as a constitutive element. In the beginning, this perspective focussed mainly on consumer behaviour, seeing products acquired as objects expressing on the material plane individuals’ self-image and how they view their position in society. Subsequently, the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life, concentrating – as in authors such as [[Joffre Dumazedier]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] – on the use of time, especially loisirs, and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action. Finally, some authors, for instance [[Richard Jenkins]] and [[A. J. Veal]], suggested an approach to lifestyles in which it is not everyday actions which make up the plane of analysis but those which the actors who adopt them consider particularly meaningful and distinctive.

==Health==

A healthy or unhealthy lifestyle will most likely be transmitted across generations. According to the study done by Case et al. (2002), when a 0-3 year old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle, this child will be 27% more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Ponthiere G. (2011) "Mortality, Family and Lifestyles", ''Journal of Family and Economic Issues'' 32 (2): 175-190&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, high income parents are more likely to eat organic food, have time to exercise, and provide the best living condition to their children. On the other hand, low income parents are more likely to participate in unhealthy activities such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Case, A., Lubotsky D. &amp; Paxson C. (2002) "Economic Status and Health in Childhood: The Origins of the Gradient", [[The American Economic Review]] 92(5): 1308-1334&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are the first teacher for every child. Everything that parents do will be very likely transferred to their children through the learning process.

Adults may be drawn together by mutual interest that results in a lifestyle. For example, [[William Dufty]] described how pursuing a sugar-free diet led to such associations:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Dufty]] (1975) [[Sugar Blues]], page 204&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{quotation| I have come to know hundreds of young people who have found that illness or bingeing on drugs and sugar became the doorway to health. Once they reestablished their own health, we had in common our interest in food. If one can use that overworked word lifestyle, we shared a sugarfree lifestyle. I kept in touch with many of them in campuses and communes, through their travels here and abroad and everywhere. One day you meet them in Boston. The next week you run into them in Southern California.}}

==Class==
Lifestyle research can contribute to the question of the relevance of the class concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bögenhold|first=Dieter|title=Social Inequality and the Sociology of Life Style: Material and Cultural Aspects of Social Stratification|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1536-7150.00125/abstract|publisher=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media culture==
The term '''lifestyle''' was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of [[Style (aesthetics)|style in art]]:&lt;ref name="Bernstein1991p23Diversity"&gt;Bernstein (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{quotation|"Life-styles", the culture industry’s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.|sign=|source=}}

[[Theodor W. Adorno]] noted that there is a "culture industry" in which the [[mass media]] is involved, but that the term "mass culture" is inappropriate:
&lt;ref name="Adorno1963mass"&gt;Adorno [1963] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98 p.98]&lt;/ref&gt; 
:{{quotation|In our drafts, we spoke of "mass culture." We replaced that expression with "culture industry" in order to exclude from the outset the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}

The [[media culture]] of [[advanced capitalism]] typically creates new "life-styles" to drive the consumption of new commodities:&lt;ref name="Bernstein1991p23Diversity"/&gt;{{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s, the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and "different" commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative "life-styles."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1747">'''Megagametogenesis''' is the development of a [[megaspore]] into an embryo sac, which is the [[gametophyte]] - though a highly reduced one - stage in the life cycle of vascular plants. 

==Eudicots==

In [[eudicot]] plants, the entire process happens inside the [[ovule]] of a plant. The details of the process vary by species, but the process described here is common. This process starts with a single [[diploid]] megasporocyte in the nucleus. This megasporocyte undergoes [[meiotic]] cell division to form four cells that are [[haploid]]. Three cells die and one that is most distant from the micropyle develops into the megaspore. This megaspore becomes larger and the nucleus of it undergoes [[mitosis]] three times until there are eight nuclei. These eight nuclei are then arranged into two groups of four. These groups both send a nucleus to the center of the cell which then becomes the polar nuclei. The three cells left at the end of the cell near the micropylar become the egg apparatus with an egg cell in the center and two synergids. A cell wall forms around the other set of nuclei and forms the antipodals. The cells in the center develop into the central cell. This entire structure with its eight nuclei is called the embryo sac.

In [[philosophy]], '''moral responsibility''' is the status of [[morality|morally]] [[desert (philosophy)|deserving]] [[praise]], [[blame]], [[reward (psychology)|reward]], or [[punishment]] for an act or omission performed or neglected in accordance with one's [[moral obligation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Klein |first= Martha |authorlink= Martha Klein |editor-first= Ted |editor-last= Honderich |editor-link = Ted Honderich | encyclopedia = Oxford Companion to Philosophy | title = responsibility | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-2205 | year = 2005 | quote = The term 'moral responsibility' covers (i) the having of a moral obligation and (ii) the fulfilment of the criteria for deserving blame or praise (punishment or reward) for a morally significant act or omission.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Deciding what (if anything) counts as "morally obligatory" is a principal concern of [[ethics]].

Philosophers refer to people who have moral responsibility for an action as [[moral agents]]. Agents have the capability to reflect upon their situation, to form [[intention]]s about how they will act, and then to carry out that action. The notion of [[free will]] has become an important issue in the debate on whether individuals are ever morally responsible for their actions and, if so, in what sense. [[Incompatibilist]]s regard determinism as at odds with free will, whereas [[compatibilist]]s think the two can coexist.
 
Moral responsibility does not necessarily equate to [[legal liability |legal responsibility]]. A person is legally responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that person for that event. Although it may often be the case that when a person is morally responsible for an act, they are also legally responsible for it, the two states do not always coincide.{{Citation needed|date= September 2011}}

==Philosophical stance==
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|220px|Various philosophical positions exist, disagreeing over [[determinism]] and free will]]
Depending on how a philosopher conceives of [[free will]], they will have different views on moral responsibility.&lt;ref name=Cave&gt;{{cite book |title=Responsibility in Law and Morality |author=Peter Cave |page =4 |quote=A common argument in the philosophical literature is that the essence of responsibility is to be found in what it means to be a human agent and to have free will...There is disagreement amongst philosophers about what freedom means, about whether human beings are free in the relevant sense, and about the relevance of freedom to responsibility... Nevertheless,...our responsibility practices have developed, and thrive, independently of ‘the truth’ about human freedom.|isbn=1841133213 |year=2002 |publisher=Hart Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incompatibilism===
{{main article|Incompatibilism}}

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{main article|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[Metaphysical libertarian]]s think actions are not always causally determined, allowing for the possibility of free will and thus moral responsibility. All libertarians are also incompatibilists; they think that if causal determinism were true of human action; people would not have free will. Accordingly, libertarians subscribe to the principle of alternate possibilities, which posits that moral responsibility requires that people could have acted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolfolk, Robert L.|first=Doris, John M., and Brianna, John M.|contribution=Identification, Situational Constraint, and Social Cognition: Studies in the Attribution of Moral Responsibility|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=61–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenomenological considerations are sometimes invoked by incompatibilists to defend a libertarian position. In daily life, we feel as though choosing otherwise is a viable option. Although this feeling doesn't firmly establish the existence of free will, some incompatibilists claim the phenomenological feeling of alternate possibilities is a prerequisite for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahmias, Eddy, |first=Morris, Stephen G., Nadelhoffer, Thomas N., and Turner, Jason|contribution=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|title=Experimental Philosophy|editors=Knobe, Joshua, and Nichols, Shaun|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-532326-9|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] suggested that people sometimes avoid incrimination and responsibility by hiding behind determinism: "...we are always ready to take refuge in a belief in determinism if this freedom weighs upon us or if we need an excuse".&lt;ref name="Sartre2"&gt;Sartre, J.P. (1943)''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar view has it that individual moral culpability lies in individual character. That is, a person with the character of a murderer has no choice other than to murder, but can still be punished because it is right to punish those of bad character. How one's character was determined is irrelevant from this perspective. Robert Cummins, for example, argues that people should not be judged for their individual actions, but rather for how those actions "reflect on their character". If character (however defined) is the dominant causal factor in determining one's choices, and one's choices are morally wrong, then one should be held accountable for those choices, regardless of genes and other such factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vuoso, G. (1987) "Background Responsibility and Excuse," ''Yale Law Journal'', 96, pp. 1680–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, R. "Culpability" and Mental Disorder", p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, there is a known exception to the assumption that moral culpability lies in either individual character or freely willed acts. The [[insanity defense]]—or its corollary, [[diminished responsibility]] (a sort of appeal to the [[fallacy of the single cause]])—can be used to argue that the guilty deed was not the product of a guilty mind.&lt;ref name = "Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, A. M., Morse, S. J. &amp; Shapiro, D. L. 2003 "Evaluation of criminal responsibility". In ''Forensic psychology.'' vol. 11 (ed. A. M. Goldstein), pp. 381–406. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the legal systems of most Western societies assume that the person is in some way not at fault, because his actions were a consequence of abnormal brain function (implying brain function is a deterministic causal agent of mind and motive).

=====The argument from luck=====

The argument from luck is a criticism against the libertarian conception of moral responsibility. It suggests that any given action, and even a person's character, is the result of various forces outside that person's control. It may not be reasonable, then, to hold that person solely morally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-luck/|title=Moral Luck|date=January 26, 2004|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Nagel]] suggests that four different types of luck (including genetic influences and other external factors) end up influencing the way that a person's actions are evaluated morally. For instance, a person driving drunk may make it home without incident, and yet this action of ''drunk driving'' might seem more morally objectionable if someone happens to jaywalk along his path (getting hit by the car).&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. 1976, "Moral Luck", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary vol. 50: 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument can be traced back to [[David Hume]]. If physical indeterminism is true, then those events that are not determined are scientifically described as probabilistic or random. It is therefore argued that it is doubtful that one can praise or blame someone for performing an action generated randomly by his nervous system (without there being any non-physical agency responsible for the observed probabilistic outcome).&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main article|Hard determinism}}
[[Hard determinist]]s (not to be confused with [[Fatalist]]s) often use [[liberty]] in practical moral considerations, rather than a notion of a free will. Indeed, faced with the possibility that determinism requires a completely different moral system, some proponents say "So much the worse for free will!".&lt;ref name="Ben1"&gt;Benditt, Theodore (1998) ''Philosophy Then and Now'' with eds. Arnold and Graham. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55786-742-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarence Darrow]], the famous defense attorney, pleaded the innocence of his clients, [[Leopold and Loeb]], by invoking such a notion of hard determinism.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence, 1924, "The Plea of Clarence Darrow, in Defense of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, Jr., On Trial for Murder" page reference is to the reprint in Philosophical Explorations: Freedom, God, and Goodness, S. Cahn (ed.), New York: Prometheus Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; During his summation, he declared:

{{quote|What has this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not his own mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was handed to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and wealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay.&lt;ref name="Darrow"/&gt;}}

[[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[Epistle to the Romans]] addresses the question of moral responsibility as follows: "Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"&lt;ref&gt;St. Paul, "Epistle to the Romans", 9:21, ''King James Bible'' Tennessee:The Gideons International&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, individuals can still be dishonoured for their acts even though those acts were ultimately completely determined by God.

Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuroethics]], argue, on the basis of such cases, that our current notion of moral responsibility is founded on libertarian (and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]]) intuitions.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, J. Cohen, J. (2004). "For the law, neuroscience changes nothing and everything". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B'', 359, 1775–1785.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research (e.g. [[neuroscience of free will]]) is undermining these intuitions by showing that the brain is responsible for our actions, not only in cases of florid [[psychosis]], but also in less obvious situations. For example, damage to the [[frontal lobe]] reduces the ability to weigh uncertain risks and make prudent decisions, and therefore leads to an increased likelihood that someone will commit a violent crime.&lt;ref name = "Brower"&gt;Brower M.C. and Price B.H. (2001). "Neuropsychiatry of frontal lobe dysfunction in violent and criminal behaviour: a critical review". ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry'', 71: 720–726.&lt;/ref&gt; This is true not only of patients with damage to the frontal lobe due to accident or stroke, but also of adolescents, who show reduced frontal lobe activity compared to adults,&lt;ref name = "SteinScott"&gt;Steinberg, L., Scott, E. S. (2003). "Less guilty by reason of adolescence: developmental immaturity, diminished responsibility, and the juvenile death penalty".''American Psychologist'' 58, 1009–1018.&lt;/ref&gt; and even of children who are chronically neglected or mistreated.&lt;ref name = "TAPANK"&gt;Teicher, M. H., Anderson, S. L., Polcari, A., Anderson, C. M., Navalta, C. P., and Kim, D. M. (2003). "The neurobiological consequences of early stress and childhood maltreatment". ''Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews'', 27: 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the guilty party can, they argue, be said to have less responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; Greene and Cohen predict that, as such examples become more common and well known, jurors’ interpretations of free will and moral responsibility will move away from the intuitive libertarian notion that currently underpins them.

[[File:Prision del Condado de Mantras.JPG|thumb|right|180px|David Eagleman explains that nature and nurture cause all criminal behavior. He likewise believes that science demands that change and improvement, rather than guilt, must become the focus of the legal justice system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/05/david-eagleman-on-morality-and-the-brain.html David Eagleman, Philosophy Bites Podcast, "David Eagleman on Morality and the Brain"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Greene and Cohen also argue that the legal system does not require this libertarian interpretation. Rather, they suggest that only retributive notions of [[justice]], in which the goal of the legal system is to punish people for misdeeds, require the libertarian intuition. Many forms of [[Ethical realism|ethically realistic]] and [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches to justice, which are aimed at promoting future welfare rather than retribution, can survive even a hard determinist interpretation of free will. Accordingly, the legal system and notions of justice can thus be maintained even in the face of emerging neuroscientific evidence undermining libertarian intuitions of free will.

Neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] maintains similar ideas. Eagleman says that the legal justice system ought to become more forward looking. He says it is wrong to ask questions of narrow culpability, rather than focusing on what is important: what needs to change in a criminal's behavior and brain. Eagleman is not saying that no one is responsible for their crimes, but rather that the "sentencing phase" should correspond with modern neuroscientific evidence. To Eagleman, it is damaging to entertain the illusion that a person can make a single decision that is somehow, suddenly, independent of their physiology and history. He describes what scientists have learned from brain damaged patients, and offers the case of a school teacher who exhibited escalating [[pedophile|pedophilic]] tendencies on two occasions—each time as results of growing tumors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia.htmlNewScientist.com, "Brain tumour causes uncontrollable paedophilia"]&lt;/ref&gt; Eagleman also warns that less attractive people and minorities tend to get longer sentencing—all of which he sees as symptoms that more science is needed in the legal system.&lt;ref name=Eagleman/&gt;

====Hard incompatibilism====
[[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] defends a skeptical position about free will he calls [[hard incompatibilism]]. In his view, we cannot have free will if our actions are causally determined by factors beyond our control, or if our actions are indeterministic events—if they happen by chance. Pereboom conceives of free will as the control in action required for moral responsibility in the sense involving deserved blame and praise, punishment and reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pereboom|first1=Derk|title=Living without Free Will|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledges that libertarian agent causation, the capacity of agents as substances to cause actions without being causally determined by factors beyond their control, is still a possibility, he regards it as unlikely against the backdrop of the most defensible physical theories. Without libertarian agent causation, Pereboom thinks the free will required for moral responsibility in the desert-involving sense is not in the offing.&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pereboom|first=Derk|title="Defending Hard Incompatibilism". In "Free Will and Moral Responsibility." |year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Inc.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-3810-6|pages=228–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also contends that by contrast with the backward-looking, desert-involving sense of moral responsibility, forward-looking senses are compatible with causal determination. For instance, causally determined agents who act badly might justifiably be blamed with the aim of forming faulty character, reconciling impaired relationships, and protecting others from harm they are apt to cause.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2014), 'Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereboom proposes that a viable criminal jurisprudence is compatible with the denial of deserved blame and punishment. His view rules out retributivist justifications for punishment, but it allows for incapacitation of dangerous criminals on the analogy with quarantine of carriers of dangerous diseases. Isolation of carriers of the Ebola virus can be justified on the ground of the right to defend against threat, a justification that does not reference desert. Pereboom contends that the analogy holds for incapacitation of dangerous criminals. He also argues that the less serious the threat, the more moderate the justifiable method of incapacitation; for certain crimes only monitoring may be needed. In addition, just as we should do what we can, within reasonable bounds, to cure the carriers of the Ebola virus we quarantine, so we should aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate the criminals we incapacitate. Pereboom also proposes that given hard incompatibilism, punishment justified as general deterrence may be legitimate when the penalties don't involve undermining an agent's capacity to live a meaningful, flourishing life, since justifying such moderate penalties need not invoke desert.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk (2001), ''Living without Free Will'', Chapter 7; Pereboom, Derk (2014), ''Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{main article|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Handcuffs-20060604.jpg|thumb|right|Some forms of compatibilism suggest the term ''free will'' should only be used to mean something more like liberty.]]

Compatibilists contend that even if determinism were true, it would still be possible for us to have free will. The Hindu text ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad Gita]]'' offers one very early compatibilist account. Facing the prospect of going to battle against kinsmen to whom he has bonds, Arjuna despairs. Krishna attempts to assuage Arjuna's anxieties. He argues that forces of nature come together to produce actions, and it is only vanity that causes us to regard ourselves as the agent in charge of these actions. However, Krishna adds this caveat: "... [But] the Man who knows the relation between the forces of Nature and actions, witnesses how some forces of Nature work upon other forces of Nature, and becomes [not] their slave..." When we are ignorant of the relationship between forces of Nature, we become passive victims of nomological facts. Krishna's admonition is intended to get Arjuna to perform his duty (i.e., fight in the battle), but he is also claiming that being a successful moral agent requires being mindful of the wider circumstances in which one finds oneself.&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bhagavad Gita|year=1962|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda also said, "Freedom means the power to act by soul guidance, not by the compulsions of desires and habits. Obeying the ego leads to bondage; obeying the soul brings liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Inspirational Thought for Each Day|year=1977|publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship|location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, Baruch Spinoza echoes the ''Bhagavad Gita{{'}}''s point about agents and natural forces, writing "men think themselves free because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant [of those causes]."&lt;ref name="Pereboom 2005 228–247"/&gt; Krishna is hostile to the influence of passions on our rational faculties, speaking up instead for the value of heeding the dictates of one's own nature: "Even a wise man acts under the impulse of his nature. Of what use is restraint?"&lt;ref name="The Bhagavad Gita"/&gt; Spinoza similarly identifies the taming of one's passions as a way to extricate oneself from merely being passive in the face of external forces and a way toward following our own natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Baruch Spinoza|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] asks why anyone would care about whether someone had the property of responsibility and speculates that the idea of moral responsibility may be "a purely metaphysical hankering".&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;Dennett, D., (1984) ''Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting''.

Mauro suggests that a sense of personal responsibility does not operate or evolve universally among humankind. He argues that it was absent in the successful civilization of the [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;

In recent years, research in [[experimental philosophy]] has explored whether people's untutored intuitions about determinism and moral responsibility are compatibilist or incompatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eddy |last=Nahmias|author2=Stephen Morris |author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer |author4=Jason Turner  |title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive? |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=28–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experimental work has included cross-cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hagop Sarkissian, Amita Chatterjee, Felipe De Brigard, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, Smita Sirker (forthcoming).[http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/hsarkissian/Is%20Belief%20in%20Free%20Will%20a%20Universal_final.pdf "Is belief in free will a cultural universal?"] Mind &amp; Language&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether people naturally have compatibilist or incompatibilist intuitions has not come out overwhelmingly in favor of one view or the other, finding evidence for both views. For instance, when people are presented with abstract cases that ask if a person could be morally responsible for an immoral act when they could not have done otherwise, people tend to say no, or give ''incompatibilist'' answers. When presented with a specific immoral act that a specific person committed, people tend to say that that person is morally responsible for their actions, even if they were determined (that is, people also give ''compatibilist'' answers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Shaun|last=Nichols |authorlink=Shaun Nichols |author2=[[Joshua Knobe]]  |title=Moral Responsibility and Determinism: The Cognitive Science of Folk Intuitions |journal=[[Noûs]] |volume=41 |issue=4|pages=663–685 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00666.x |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collective==
{{Main article|Collective responsibility}}
When people attribute moral responsibility, they usually attribute it to individual moral agents.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joel Feinberg, among others, has argued that corporations and other groups of people can have what is called ‘collective moral responsibility’ for a state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Risser, David T. 2006. 'Collective Moral Responsibility'. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/collecti.htm ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''] (Accessed 8 Sept 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when [[South Africa]] had an [[apartheid]] regime, the country's government might have been said to have had collective moral responsibility for the violation of the rights of non-European South Africans.

==Lack of sense of responsibility of psychopaths==
One of the attributes defined for [[psychopathy]] is "failure to accept responsibility for own actions".&lt;ref name=factorstructure&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harpur, T. J., Hare, R.

== Artificial systems ==

The emergence of [[Outline of automation|automation, robotics and related technologies]] prompted the question, 'Can an artificial system be morally responsible?'&lt;ref name="Allen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Varner|first2=Gary|last3=Zinser|first3=Jason|title=Prolegomena to any future artificial moral agent|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=2000|volume=12|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1080/09528130050111428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Colin|last2=Smit|first2=Iva|last3=Wallach|first3=Wendell|title=Artificial Morality: Top-down, Bottom-up and Hybrid Approaches|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s10676-006-0004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparrow|first1=Robert|title=Killer Robots|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=62–77|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2007.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has a closely related variant, 'When (if ever) does moral responsibility transfer from its human creator(s) to the system?'.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grodzinsky|first1=Frances S.|last2=Miller|first2=Keith W.|last3=Wolf|first3=Marty J.|title=The ethics of designing artificial agents|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=21 Jun 2008|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=115–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuflik|first1=Arthur|title=Computers in control: Rational transfer of authority or irresponsible abdication of autonomy?|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=173–184|doi=10.1023/A:1010087500508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions ''arguably'' adjoin with but are distinct from [[machine ethics]], which is concerned with the moral behavior of artificial systems.  Whether an artificial system's behavior qualifies it to be morally responsible has been a key focus of debate.

=== Arguments that artificial systems cannot be morally responsible ===

Batya Friedman and Peter Kahn Jr posited that [[intentionality]] is a necessary condition for moral responsibility, and that computer systems as conceivable in 1992 in material and structure could not have intentionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Batya|last2=Kahn, Jr.|first2=Peter H.|title=Human Agency and Responsible Computing: Implications for Computer System Design|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|date=January 1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=7–14|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(92)90075-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Kuflik asserted that humans must bear the ultimate moral responsibility for a computer's decisions, as it is humans who design the computers and write their programs. He further proposed that humans can never relinquish oversight of computers.&lt;ref name="Kuflik1999" /&gt;

Frances Grodzinsky et al. considered artificial systems that could be modelled as [[finite state machines]].  They posited that if the machine had a fixed state transition table, then it could not be morally responsible. If the machine could modify its table, then the machine's designer still retained some moral responsibility.&lt;ref name="Grodzinsky2008" /&gt;

Patrick Hew argued that for an artificial system to be morally responsible, its rules for behaviour and the mechanisms for supplying those rules must not be supplied entirely by external humans.  He further argued that such systems are a substantial departure from technologies and theory as extant in 2014.  An artificial system based on those technologies will carry zero responsibility for its behaviour.  Moral responsibility is apportioned to the humans that created and programmed the system.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Artificial moral agents are infeasible with foreseeable technologies|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=13 May 2014|volume=16|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1007/s10676-014-9345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(A more extensive review of arguments may be found in.&lt;ref name="Hew2014"/&gt;)

=== Arguments that artificial systems can be morally responsible ===

Colin Allen et al. proposed that an artificial system may be morally responsible if its behaviours are functionally indistinguishable from a moral person, coining the idea of a 'Moral Turing Test'.&lt;ref name="Allen2000"/&gt; They subsequently disavowed the Moral Turing Test in recognition of controversies surrounding the [[Turing Test]].&lt;ref name="Allen2005" /&gt;

Andreas Matthias described a 'responsibility gap' where to hold humans responsible for a machine would be an injustice, but to hold the machine responsible would challenge 'traditional' ways of ascription.  He proposed three cases where the machine's behaviour ought to be attributed to the machine and not its designers or operators.  First, he argued that modern machines are inherently unpredictable (to some degree), but perform tasks that need to be performed yet cannot be handled by simpler means.  Second, that there are increasing 'layers of obscurity' between manufacturers and system, as hand coded programs are replaced with more sophisticated means.  Third, in systems that have rules of operation that can be changed during the operation of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthias|first1=Andreas|title=The responsibility gap: Ascribing responsibility for the actions of learning automata|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=175–183|doi=10.1007/s10676-004-3422-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary candidates for non-cellular life are viruses. A minority of biologists consider viruses to be living [[organism]]s, but most do not.

Engineers sometimes use the term "[[artificial life]]" to refer to [[software]] and [[robot]]s inspired by biological processes, but these do not satisfy any biological definition of life.

== Viruses as non-cellular life ==
{{Life timeline}}{{Further|Virus|Girus|Viral evolution}}
The nature of viruses was unclear for many years following their discovery as [[pathogen]]s. They were described as [[poison]]s or [[toxin]]s at first, then as "infectious proteins", but with advances in microbiology it became clear that they also possessed [[genetic material]], a defined structure, and the ability to spontaneously assemble from their constituent parts. This spurred extensive debate as to whether they should be regarded as fundamentally organic or inorganic — as very small biological [[organism]]s or very large biochemical [[molecule]]s — and since the 1950s many scientists have thought of viruses as existing at the border between chemistry and life; a gray area between living and nonliving.&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forterre 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lwoff|first=A.|date=1957-01-01|title=The Concept of Virus|url=http://mic.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-17-2-239;jsessionid=j7YU0LkUikNMC-na5q7Hg5R8.x-sgm-live-02|journal=Microbiology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=239–253|doi=10.1099/00221287-17-2-239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent discovery of [[giant viruses]] (aka giruses, [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]], NCLDVs) has reignited this debate, since they are not only physically larger than previously known viruses, but also possess much more extensive [[genome]]s, including [[gene]]s coding for [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]s, key proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which were previously thought to be exclusive to cellular organisms. This raises the prospect that the giant viruses may have had extinct ancestors (or even undiscovered ones) capable of engaging in life processes (such as [[evolution]] and [[Self-replication|replication]]) independent of cells, and that modern viruses lost those abilities [[Secondary loss|secondarily]]. The viral lineage including this ancestor would be ancient and may have originated alongside the earliest [[archaea]] or before the [[Last universal common ancestor|LUCA]]. If such a virus is discovered, or its past existence supported by further genetic evidence, most biologists agree that it would constitute a ''bona fide'' lifeform, and its descendants (at least the giant viruses, and possibly including all known viruses) could be [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] classified in a fourth [[Domain (biology)|domain]] of life. Discovery of the [[pandoravirus]]es, with genomes are even larger than the other giant viruses and exhibiting particularly low [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with the three existing domains, further discredited the traditional view that viruses simply "pick-pocketed" all of their genes from cellular organisms, and further supported the "complex ancestors" hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Villarreal 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/science/changing-view-on-viruses-not-so-small-after-all.html|title=Changing View on Viruses: Not So Small After All|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2013-07-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nasir|first=Arshan|last2=Kim|first2=Kyung Mo|last3=Caetano-Anolles|first3=Gustavo|date=2012-08-24|title=Giant viruses coexisted with the cellular ancestors and represent a distinct supergroup along with superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=12|pages=156|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-156|issn=1471-2148|pmc=3570343|pmid=22920653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viroids ==
{{Main|Viroid}}
Viroids are the smallest infectious pathogens known to biologists, consisting solely of short strands of circular, single-stranded RNA without protein coats. They are mostly plant pathogens and some are animal pathogens, from which some are of commercial importance. Viroid genomes are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection by themselves are around 2,000 nucleobases in size. Viroids are the first known representatives of a new biological realm of sub-viral pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid5095900"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber "virus".

== Taxonomy ==
In discussing the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[domain (biology)|domains]] of life, the terms "Acytota" or "Aphanobionta" are occasionally used as the name of a [[virus|viral]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], domain, or [[empire (biology)|empire]]. The corresponding [[cellular life]] name would be [[Cytota]]. Non-cellular organisms and cellular life would be the two top-level subdivisions of life, whereby life as a whole would be known as organisms, [[Nature|Naturae]], or [[Vitae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Crucial steps to life: From chemical reactions to code using agents|journal=Biosystems|volume=140|pages=49–57|doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2015.12.007|pmid=26723230|author1=Witzany|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxon Cytota would include three top-level subdivisions of its own, the domains [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukarya]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">Flexible or '''opportunistic breeders''' mate whenever the conditions of their environment become favorable. Their ability and motivation to mate are primarily independent of day-length ([[photoperiod]]) and instead rely on cues from short-term changes in local conditions like rainfall, food abundance and temperature. Another factor is the presence of suitable breeding sites, which may only form with heavy rain or other environmental changes.&lt;ref name="Duellman"&gt;WE Duellman, L Trueb. ''Biology of amphibians.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, they are distinct from [[seasonal breeder]]s that rely on changes in day length to induce entry into [[estrus]] and to cue mating, and [[continuous breeder]]s like humans that can mate year-round. Other categories of breeders that perhaps can be subdivided under the heading "opportunistic" have been used to describe many species, such as many that are [[anuran]]s like frogs. These include '''sporadic wet''' and '''sporadic dry''', describing animals that breed sporadically not always under favorable conditions of rain or lack thereof.&lt;ref name="Duellman" /&gt;

Many opportunistic breeders are non-mammals. Those that are mammals tend to be small [[rodents]].&lt;ref&gt;Malpoux B. ''The Neuroendocrine Control of Seasonal Rhythms.'' In: Conn PM, Freeman ME, ed., Neuroendocrinology in physiology and medicine. Humana Press, 1999, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt;

Since changes in season can coincide with favorable changes in environment, the distinction between seasonal breeder and opportunistic can be muddled. In equatorial climes, the change in seasons is not always perceptible and thus, changes in day length not remarkable. Thus, the [[tree kangaroo]] (Dendrolagus) previously categorized as a seasonal breeder is now suspected to be an opportunistic breeder.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R, Johnson P. ''Bennett's Tree-kangaroo.'' In: R. Straham, ed., Mammals of Australia, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1995, pp. 307-8, {{PMID|16026787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, opportunists can have qualities of seasonal breeders. The [[red crossbill]] exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, in order to breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1365634 |author=H.B. Tordoff |author2=W.R. Dawson |title= The influence of daylength on reproductive timing in the red crossbill |journal=The Condor |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages= 416–22 |year= 1965 |jstor=1365634}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jez.1402720306 |author=T.P.

Exp. Zool. |volume=272 |pages=213–26 |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development.

==Physiology==
Opportunistic breeders are typically capable of breeding at any time or becoming fertile within a short period of time. An example is the [[Acomys russatus|golden spiny mouse]] where changes in dietary salt in its desert habitat due to rainfall appear to cue reproductive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= U. Shanas |author2= A. Haim |title= Diet salinity and vasopressin as reproduction modulators in the desert-dwelling golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus) |journal=Physiology and Behavior |volume=81 |pages=645–50 |year=2004 |pmid=15178158 |issue= 4 |doi= 10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.03.002|url=https://zenodo.org/record/905896/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased levels of salinity in drying vegetation cause females to experience a reproductive hiatus.

While reproduction is generally independent of photoperiod, animals can still experience reduced fertility with changes in day-length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Parent–offspring conflict''' ('''POC''') is an expression coined in 1974 by [[Robert Trivers]]. It is used to describe the [[evolutionary conflict]] arising from differences in optimal [[parental investment]] (PI) in an offspring from the standpoint of the [[parent]] and the [[offspring]]. PI is any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that decreases the parent's ability to invest in other offspring, while the selected offspring's chance of surviving increases.

POC occurs in sexually reproducing species and is based on a genetic conflict: Parents are equally related to each of their offspring and are therefore expected to equalize their investment among them. Offspring are only half or less related to their [[sibling]]s (and fully related to themselves), so they try to get more PI than the parents intended to provide even at their siblings' disadvantage. 
However, POC is limited by the close genetic relationship between parent and offspring: If an offspring obtains additional PI at the expense of its siblings, it decreases the number of its surviving siblings. Therefore, any [[gene]] in an offspring that leads to additional PI decreases (to some extent) the number of surviving copies of itself that may be located in siblings. Thus, if the costs in siblings are too high, such a gene might be selected against despite the benefit to the offspring. 
The problem of specifying how an individual is expected to weigh a relative against itself has been examined by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in 1964 in the context of [[kin selection]]. [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's rule]] says that [[altruistic behavior]] will be positively selected if the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the genetic relatedness of the recipient to the performer is greater than the cost to the performer of a social act. Conversely, selfish behavior can only be favoured when Hamilton's inequality is not satisfied. This leads to the prediction that, other things being equal, POC will be stronger under half siblings (e.g., unrelated males father a female's successive offspring) than under full siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R.L. | authorlink = Robert Trivers | year = 1974 | title = Parent-offspring conflict | url = | journal = Am.

==Occurrence==

===In plants===
In [[plants]], POC over the allocation of resources to the brood members may affect both brood size (number of [[seed]]s matured within a single fruit) and seed size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sadras | first1 = V.O. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R.F. | year = 2009 | title = Do plant parts compete for resources? An evolutionary perspective | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 183 | issue = 3| pages = 565–574 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02848.x | pmid = 19413690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning brood size, the most economic use of maternal resources is achieved by packing as many seeds as possible in one fruit, i.e., minimizing the cost of packing per seed. In contrast, offspring benefeits from low numbers of seeds per fruit, which reduces sibling competition before and after dispersal. Conflict over seed size arises because there usually exists an inverse exponential relationship between seed size and [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], that is, the fitness of a seed increases at a diminishing rate with resource investment but the fitness of the maternal parent has an optimum, as demonstrated by Smith and Fretwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Fretwell | first2 = S.D. | year = 1974 | title = The optimal balance between size and number of offspring | url = | journal = Am. Nat. | volume = 108 | issue = 962| pages = 499–506 | doi = 10.1086/282929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[marginal value theorem]]). However, the optimum resource investment from the offspring's point of view would be the maximum that it can possibly get from the maternal parent.

This conflict about resource allocation is most obviously manifested in the reduction of brood size (i.e. a decrease in the proportion of [[ovule]]s matured into seeds). Such reduction can be assumed to be caused by the offspring: If the maternal parent's interest were to produce as few seeds as observed, [[Selection (biology)|selection]] would not favour the production of extra ovules that do not mature into seeds. (Although other explanations for this phenomenon exist, such as [[genetic load]], resource depletion or maternal regulation of offspring quality, they could not be supported by experiments.)

There are several possibilities how the offspring can affect paternal resource allocation to brood members. Evidence exists for [[siblicide]] by dominant embryos: Embryos formed early kill the remaining embryos through an aborting chemical. In oaks, early fertilized ovules prevent the [[fertilization]] of other ovules by inhibiting the [[pollen tube]] entry into the [[embryo sac]]. In some species, the maternal parent has evolved postfertilization [[abortion]] of few seeded pods. Nevertheless, cheating by the offspring is also possible here, namely by late siblicide, when the postfertilization abortion has ceased.

According to the general POC model, reduction of brood size – if caused by POC – should depend on genetic relatedness between offspring in a fruit. Indeed, abortion of embryos is more common in [[out-crossing]] than in [[self-pollinating]] plants (seeds in cross-pollinating plants are less related than in self-pollinating plants). Moreover, the level of solicitation of resources by the offspring is also increased in cross-pollinating plants: There are several reports that the average weight of crossed seeds is greater than of seeds produced by self-fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uma Shaanker | first1 = R. | last2 = Ganeshaiah | first2 = K.N. | last3 = Bawa | first3 = K.S. | year = 1988 | title = Parent-offspring conflict, sibling rivalry, and brood size patterns in plants | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 177–205 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.001141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
Some of the earliest examples of parent-offspring conflict were seen in [[bird]] broods and especially in [[raptor birds|raptor]] species. While parent birds often lay two eggs and attempt to raise two or more young, the strongest fledgling takes a greater share of the food brought by parents and will often kill the weaker sibling ([[siblicide]]). Such conflicts have been suggested as a driving force in the evolution of optimal [[clutch size]] in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mock | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Drummond | first2 = H. | last3 = Stinson | first3 = C.H. | year = 1990 | title = Avian siblicide | url = | journal = Am. Sci. | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 438–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[blue-footed booby]], parent-offspring conflict results in times of food scarcity. When there is less food available in a given year, the older, dominant chick will often kill the younger chick by either attacking directly, or by driving it from the nest. Parents try to prevent siblicide by building nests with steeper sides &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=David J.|title=The Role of Parents in Siblicidal Brood Reduction of Two Booby Species|journal=The Auk|year=1995|volume=112|issue=4|pages=860–869|doi=10.2307/4089018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by laying heavier second eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Alba|first=Liliana |author2=Roxana Torres |author3=G.R. Bortolotti|title=Seasonal Egg-Mass Variation and Laying Sequence in a Bird with Facultative Brood Reductions|journal=The Auk|year=2007|volume=124|issue=2|pages=643–652|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[643:sevals]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
Even before POC theory arose, debates took place over whether [[infant]]s [[wean]] themselves or mothers actively wean their infants. Furthermore, it was discussed whether maternal rejections increase infant independence. It turned out that both mother and infant contribute to infant independence. Maternal rejections can be followed by a short-term increase in infant contact but they eventually result in a long-term decrease of contact as has been shown for several primates: In wild [[baboon]]s infants that are rejected early and frequently spend less time in contact whereas those that are not rejected stay much longer in the proximity of their mother and suckle or ride even in advanced ages. In wild [[chimpanzee]]s an abrupt increase in maternal rejections and a decrease in mother-offspring contact is found when mothers resume [[Estrus#Estrus|estrus]] and consort with males. In [[rhesus macaque]]s a high probability of conception in the following mating season is associated with a high rate of maternal rejection. Rejection and behavioral conflicts can occur during the first months of an infant's life and when the mother resumes estrus. These findings suggest that the [[reproduction]] of the mother is influenced by the interaction with their offspring. So there is a potential for conflicts over PI.
It was also observed in rhesus macaques that the number of contacts made by offspring is significantly higher than the number of contacts made by mother during a mating season, whereas the opposite holds for the number of broken contacts. This fact suggests that the mother resists offspring's demands for contact, whereas offspring is apparently more interested in spending time in contact. At three months of infant age a shift from mother to infant in responsibility for maintaining contact takes place. So when the infant becomes more independent, its effort to maintain proximity to its mother increases. This might sound paradoxical but becomes clear when one takes into account that POC increases during the period of PI. In summary, all these findings are consistent with POC-theory.

One might object that time in contact is not a reasonable measure for PI and that, for example, time for milk transfer ([[lactation]]) would be a better one. Here one can argue that mother and infant have different [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] needs due to the fact that they have different surface-to-volume ratios resulting in more rapid loss of heat in infants compared to adults. So infants may be more sensitive to low temperatures than their mothers. An infant might try to compensate by increased contact time with their mother, which could initiate a behavioral conflict over time. Consistency of this hypothesis has been shown for [[Japanese macaque]]s where decreasing temperatures result in higher maternal rejections and increased number of contacts made by infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maestripieri | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Parent-offspring conflict in primates | url = | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 923–951 | doi=10.1023/a:1015537201184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In social insects===

In eusocial species, the parent-offspring conflict takes on a unique role because of [[haplodiploidy]] and the prevalence of sterile workers. Sisters are more related to each other (0.75) than to their mothers (0.5) or brothers (0.25). In most cases, this drives female workers to try and obtain a sex ratio of 3:1 (females to males) in the colony. However, queens are equally related to both sons and daughters, so they prefer a sex ratio of 1:1. The conflict in social insects is about the level investment the queen should provide for each sex for current and future offspring. It is generally thought that workers will win this conflict and the sex ratio will be closer to 3:1, however there are examples, like in ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', where the queen has considerable control in forcing a 1:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bourke, A.F.G. and F.L.W. Ratnieks | year = 2001 | title = Kin-selected conflict in the bumble-bee ''Bombus terrestris'' (Hymenoptera: Apidae) | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 268 | pages = 347–355 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1381 | pmid=11270430 | pmc=1088613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
An important illustration of such conflict is provided by David Haig’s (1993) work on genetic conflicts in pregnancy. Haig has argued that [[fetus|fetal]] genes would be selected to draw more resources from the mother than it would be optimal for the mother to give, a hypothesis that has received empirical support. The [[placenta]], for example, secretes allocrine [[hormone]]s that decrease the sensitivity of the mother to [[insulin]] and thus make a larger supply of blood sugar available to the fetus. The mother responds by increasing the level of insulin in her bloodstream, and to counteract this effect the placenta has insulin receptors that stimulate the production of insulin-degrading [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haig | first1 = D. | authorlink = David Haig (biologist) | year = 1993 | title = Genetic conflicts in human pregnancy | url = | journal = Quart. Rev. Biol. | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 495–532 | doi = 10.1086/418300 | pmid = 8115596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 30 percent of human [[fertilisation|conceptions]] do not progress to full term (22 percent before becoming clinical pregnancies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3393170 | doi=10.1056/NEJM198807283190401 | volume=319 | title=Incidence of early loss of pregnancy | journal=N Engl J Med | pages=189–94 | last1 = Wilcox | first1 = AJ | last2 = Weinberg | first2 = CR | last3 = O'Connor | first3 = JF | last4 = Baird | first4 = DD | last5 = Schlatterer | first5 = JP | last6 = Canfield | first6 = RE | last7 = Armstrong | first7 = EG | last8 = Nisula | first8 = BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this creates a second arena for conflict between the mother and the fetus, because the fetus will have a lower quality cut off point for [[spontaneous abortion]] than the mother. The mother's quality cut-off point should also decline as she nears the end of her reproductive life and it may be significant that the offspring of older mothers have a higher incidence of genetic defects. Initially, the maintenance of pregnancy is controlled by the maternal hormone [[progesterone]], but in later stages it is controlled by the fetal [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]] released into the maternal bloodstream, which causes the release of maternal progesterone. There is also conflict over blood supply to the placenta, with the fetus being prepared to demand a larger blood supply than is optimal for the mother (or even for itself, since high birth weight is a risk factor). This results in [[hypertension]] and, significantly, high [[birth weight]] is positively correlated with maternal blood pressure.

After birth the young infant may demand more nutritional resources than the lactating mother is prepared to provide, and the presence of [[benzodiazepine]]-like compounds in [[breast milk]] may function to keep this in check, although its primary function is to calm the infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dencker |first1=SJ |title=Quantification of naturally occurring benzodiazepine-like substances in human breast milk. |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=1992 |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |pmid=1589563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A tripartite (fetus–mother–father) immune conflict in humans and other placentals===
{{further|Microchimerism#Microchimerism and disease within the context of a tripartite conflict|l1=Microchimerism and disease within the context of a tripartite conflict}}

During pregnancy, there is a two-way traffic of immunologically active cell lines through the placenta. Fetal [[lymphocyte]] lines may survive in women even decades after giving birth. These cells may serve the adaptive interest of the mother, however, they may also serve conflicting interests of the fetus or those of the father. This mixture of shared or contradicting interests has been hypothesized as giving rise to diseases like autoimmune diseases, infertility, and habitual abortion in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Apari P, Rózsa L| title=The tripartite immune conflict in placentals and a hypothesis on fetal→maternal Microchimerism| format=pdf| journal=Medical Hypotheses| year=2009| volume=72|pages= 52–54|pmid= 18930355|issue= 1|doi= 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.08.021| url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/microchimerism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pest house''', '''plague house''', '''pesthouse''' or '''fever shed''' was a type of building used for persons afflicted with [[communicable disease]]s such as [[tuberculosis]], [[cholera]], [[smallpox]] or [[typhus]]. Often used for forcible [[quarantine]], many towns and cities had one or more pesthouses accompanied by a cemetery or a waste pond nearby for disposal of the dead.

==Fever sheds in Canada==
{{main|Typhus epidemic of 1847}}
Fever sheds were built in several communities across [[Eastern Canada]] in 1847, to quarantine sick and dying [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, who contracted [[typhus]] during the voyage to the New World during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].
===Montreal===
In [[Montreal]], between 3,500 and 6,000 Irish immigrants died in fever sheds in a quarantine area known as [[Goose Village, Montreal|Windmill Point]]. Three sheds were initially constructed,{{convert|150|ft|m}} long by 40 to {{convert|50|ft|m}} wide. As thousands more sick immigrants landed, more sheds had to be erected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gallagher |first=The Reverend John A. |year=1936 |title=The Irish Emigration of 1847 and Its Canadian Consequences|journal=CCHA Report, University of Manitoba Web Site|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1935-36/Gallagher.html|accessdate=2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sheds would grow to 22, with troops cordoning off the area so the sick could not escape.&lt;ref name="Bruemmer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://montrealnewsinfo.blogspot.com/2009/05/seeking-hope-they-found-death.html|title=Seeking hope, they found death|last=Bruemmer|first=Rene|date=2009-05-30|work=Montreal Gazette|publisher=Canwest|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto===
In [[Toronto]], during the summer of 1847, 863 Irish immigrants died of typhus at fever sheds built by the [[Toronto Board of Health]] at the northwest corner of [[King Street (Toronto)|King]] and [[John Street (Toronto)|John Street]]. There were at least 12 sheds, 22 metres long by 7.5 metres wide. &lt;ref name=toplaques&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto's Historical Plaques|url=http://www.torontoplaques.com/Pages_GHI/Irish_Immigrants_and_the_Fever_Sheds.html|website=Irish Immigrants and the Fever Sheds 1847|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=BlogTO&gt;{{cite news|title=The UnderTOw: The Fever Sheds|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2007/04/the_undertow_the_fever_sheds/|accessdate=21 January 2012|newspaper=BlogTO|date=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint John, New Brunswick===
[[Partridge Island, New Brunswick]], just outside the main harbour of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], was chosen as the location for a pest house and quarantine station as far back as 1785. In 1847, with a large influx of Irish migrants, the typhus epidemic quickly filled the fever shed with sick and dying. By the 1847 typhus season, 2115 people had died in New Brunswick, with 1196 dying at Partridge Island and in Saint John.&lt;ref name=mccord&gt;{{cite web|title=1967.25A-C {{!}} Partridge Island|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/1967.25A-C|website=[[McCord Museum]]|accessdate=22 January 2012|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:If You Talk Too Much This Man May Die mirror.jpg|thumb|upright|An appeal to self-interest during [[World War II]].]]
'''Self-interest''' generally refers to a focus on the needs or desires (''interests'') of the [[self]]. A number of [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economy|economic]] theories examine the role of self-interest in motivating human action.

==In philosophy==&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
Philosophical concepts concerned with self-interest include:
*[[Enlightened self-interest]], a philosophy which states that acting to further the interests of others also serves one's own self-interest.
*[[Ethical egoism]], the ethical position that moral agents ''ought'' to do what is in their own self-interest.
*[[Hedonism]], the school of ethics which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.
**[[Epicureanism]], a philosophical system related to hedonism.
*[[Individualism]], a philosophy stressing the worth of individual selves.
*[[Rational egoism]], the position that all rational actions are those done in one's self-interest.

==In psychology==
Psychological concepts concerned with self-interest include [[psychological egoism]], the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest and [[narcissism]], which is an unhealthy self-absorption due to a disturbance in the sense of self.

==In biology==
In [[Richard Dawkins]]' book [[The Selfish Gene]], self-interest was considered a major artifact in evolution, a necessary process for living organisms.

[[File:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|In the first stage of sexual reproduction, "meiosis", the number of chromosomes is reduced from a [[diploid]] number (2n) to a [[haploid]] number (n). During "fertilization", haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored.]]

'''Sexual reproduction''' is a kind of [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] where generations alternate between cells with a single set of [[chromosome]]s ([[haploid]]) and cells with a double set of chromosomes ([[diploid]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Smith &amp; Eörz Szathmáry, The Major Transitions in Evolution, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]], 1995, p 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexual reproduction'' is by far the most common life cycle in [[eukaryotes]], for example animals and plants. 

Diploid cells divide into haploid cells in a process called [[meiosis]]. Two haploid cells combine into one diploid cell in a process called [[fertilisation]]. Between fertilisation and meiosis there can be a large number of [[mitosis|cell division]]s without change of the number of chromosomes.  

[[Fertilization]] creates a single-celled [[zygote]] which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called [[genetic recombination]], genetic material ([[DNA]]) joins up so that [[homologous chromosome]] sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents. For instance, in [[human reproduction]] each human cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Meiosis in the parents' gonads produce gamete cells which only contain 23 chromosomes each. When the gametes are combined via [[sexual intercourse]] to form a fertilized egg, the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 chromosome pairs or 46 total.

Cell division [[mitosis]] then initiates the development of a new individual [[organism]] in [[multicellular organism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization | title = Fertilization | publisher = Merriam-Webster | accessdate = 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Otto|first1=Sarah P.|last2=Lenormand|first2=Thomas|title=EVOLUTION OF SEX: RESOLVING THE PARADOX OF SEX AND RECOMBINATION|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 April 2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=252–261|doi=10.1038/nrg761|pmid=11967550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle because [[asexual reproduction]] should be able to outcompete it as every young organism created can bear its own young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This 50% cost is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] disadvantage of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold cost of sex includes this cost and the fact that any organism can only pass on 50% of its own genes to its offspring. One definite advantage of sexual reproduction is that it prevents the accumulation of genetic [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ng.3216 | pmid = 25685891 | laydate = 4 March 2015 | laysummary = http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/opinion/making-sense-sex | journal = Nature Genetics | title = Recombination affects accumulation of damaging and disease-associated mutations in human populations | year = 2015 | last1 = Hussin | first1 = Julie G | last2 = Hodgkinson | first2 = Alan | last3 = Idaghdour | first3 = Youssef | last4 = Grenier | first4 = Jean-Christophe | last5 = Goulet | first5 = Jean-Philippe| last6 = Gbeha | first6 = Elias | last7 = Hip-Ki | first7 = Elodie | last8 = Awadalla | first8 = Philip | volume=47 | issue = 4 | pages=400–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual selection]] is a mode of [[natural selection]] in which some individuals out-reproduce others of a population because they are better at securing [[Mating|mates]] for sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=281|author=Cecie Starr|edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a powerful evolutionary force that does not exist in asexual populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11395771|year=2001|author1=Agrawal|first1=A. F.|title=Sexual selection and the maintenance of sexual reproduction|journal=Nature|volume=411|issue=6838|pages=692–5|doi=10.1038/35079590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokaryote]]s, whose initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material, reproduce through asexual reproduction but may,  in [[lateral gene transfer]], display processes such as [[bacterial conjugation]], [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], which are similar to sexual reproduction although they do not lead to reproduction.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The first [[fossil]]ized evidence of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is from the [[Stenian]] period, about 1 to 1.2 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=dateref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = N.J. Buttefield | year = 2000 | title = Bangiomorpha pubescens n.  gen., n. sp.: implications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity,  and the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes | url = http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/content/26/3/386.abstract | journal = [[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–404 | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2000)026&lt;0386:BPNGNS&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists studying [[evolution]] propose several explanations for why sexual reproduction developed and why it is maintained. These reasons include reducing the likelihood of the [[Mullers ratchet|accumulation]] of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of [[red queen hypothesis|adaptation to changing environments]],&lt;ref name=Gray2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Goddard | first2 = M.

Larger [[population]]s appear to respond more quickly to benefits obtained through sexual reproduction than do smaller population sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12478292|year=2002|author1=Colegrave|first1=N|title=Sex releases the speed limit on evolution|journal=Nature|volume=420|issue=6916|pages=664–6|doi=10.1038/nature01191|bibcode=2002Natur.420..664C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained by theories that work at several [[levels of selection]], though some of these models remain controversial.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, newer models presented in recent years suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly reproducing [[complex organism]]s.

Sexual reproduction allows these species to exhibit characteristics that depend on the specific [[Natural environment|environment]] that they inhabit, and the particular survival strategies that they employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12064-009-0077-9|title=Diploidy and the selective advantage for sexual reproduction in unicellular organisms|year=2009|last1=Kleiman|first1=Maya|last2=Tannenbaum|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Theory in Biosciences|volume=128|issue=4|pages=249–85|pmid=19902285|arxiv=0901.1320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual selection==
{{main|Sexual selection}}
In order to sexually reproduce, both males and females need to find a [[mating|mate]]. Generally in animals [[mate choice]] is made by females while males compete to be chosen. This can lead [[organism]]s to extreme efforts in order to reproduce, such as combat and display, or produce extreme features caused by a [[positive feedback]] known as a [[Fisherian runaway]]. Thus sexual reproduction, as a form of [[natural selection]], has an effect on [[evolution]]. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is where the basic [[phenotypic trait]]s vary between males and females of the same [[species]]. Dimorphism is found in both [[sex organ]]s and in [[secondary sex characteristics]], body size, physical strength and morphology, [[biological ornament]]ation, [[behavior]] and other bodily traits. However, sexual selection is only implied over an extended period of time leading to sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Dimijian, G. G. (2005). Evolution of sexuality: biology and behavior. Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center), 18, 244–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex ratio==
Apart from some [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[wasp]]s, organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 [[sex ratio]] of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist [[Ronald Fisher]] outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as [[Fisher's principle]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially says the following:

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

===Insects===
{{further|Insect#Reproduction and development}}
[[File:Australian Emperor mating and laying.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Australian emperor]] laying egg, guarded by the male]]
Insect species make up more than two-thirds of all [[Extant taxon|extant]] animal species. Most insect species reproduce sexually, though some species are facultatively [[parthenogenetic]]. Many insects species have [[sexual dimorphism]], while in others the sexes look nearly identical. Typically they have two sexes with males producing spermatozoa and females ova. The ova develop into eggs that have a covering called the [[chorion]], which forms before internal fertilization. Insects have very diverse mating and reproductive strategies most often resulting in the male depositing [[spermatophore]] within the female, which she stores until she is ready for egg fertilization. After fertilization, and the formation of a zygote, and varying degrees of development, in many species the eggs are deposited outside the female; while in others, they develop further within the female and are born live.

===Mammals===
{{main|Mammalian reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}}
There are three extant kinds of mammals: [[monotreme]]s, [[placental]]s and [[marsupial]]s, all with internal fertilization. In placental mammals, offspring are born as juveniles: complete animals with the [[sex organ]]s present although not reproductively functional. After several months or years, depending on the species, the sex organs develop further to maturity and the animal becomes [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]]. Most female mammals are only [[fertility|fertile]] during certain periods during their [[estrous]] cycle, at which point they are ready to mate. Individual male and female mammals meet and carry out [[animal sexual behavior#Mammals|copulation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} For most mammals, males and females [[Promiscuity|exchange sexual partners throughout their adult lives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reichard|first=U.H. |title=Monogamy—A variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62–7 |year=2002|url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204835/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf|archivedate=24 May 2013|accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash,Lipton,2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lipton, Judith Eve |author2=Barash, David P. |title=The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People |publisher=W.H.

===Fish===
{{further|Fish#Reproductive system}}
The vast majority of fish species lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/bony-fish/reproduction.htm BONY FISHES - Reproduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; some species lay their eggs on a substrate like a rock or on plants, while others scatter their eggs and the eggs are fertilized as they drift or sink in the water column.

Some fish species use internal fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or give birth to live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the [[guppy]] and mollies or ''[[Poecilia]]''. Fishes that give birth to live young can be [[ovoviviparous]], where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in [[seahorse]]s, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young.&lt;ref name=Cavendish2001&gt;
{{Cite book | author = M. Cavendish | year = 2001 | title = Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World | url = https://books.google.com/?id=s5zZJVu2hxYC&amp;pg=PA1254 | page = 1252 | isbn = 978-0-7614-7194-3 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | accessdate = 2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishes can also be [[viviparous]], where the female supplies nourishment to the internally growing offspring.  Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, where a single fish is both male and female and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Orlando EF, Katsu Y, Miyagawa S, Iguchi T | year = 2006 | title = Cloning and differential  expression of estrogen receptor and aromatase genes in the self-fertilizing  hermaphrodite and male mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Endocrinology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–365 | doi = 10.1677/jme.1.02101 | pmid = 17032750 | last2 = Katsu | last3 = Miyagawa | last4 = Iguchi }}&lt;/ref&gt; One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; ''[[Poecilia formosa]]'' is a unisex species that uses a form of [[parthenogenesis]] called [[gynogenesis]], where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring.

==Plants==
{{main|Plant reproduction}}
Animals typically produce gametes directly by meiosis. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes are called eggs or ova. In animals, fertilization follows immediately after meiosis. Plants on the other hand have mitosis occurring in spores, which are produced by meiosis. The spores germinate into the gametophyte phase. The gametophytes of different groups of plants vary in size; angiosperms have as few as three cells in pollen, and mosses and other so called primitive plants may have several million cells. Plants have an [[alternation of generations]] where the sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores within the sporangium by meiosis.

===Flowering plants===
[[File:hosta3.jpg|thumb|right|Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants.]]
[[Flowering plant]]s are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce either sexually or asexually. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers.  The [[Stamen|anther]] produces [[pollen|pollen grains]] which contain the male [[gametophyte]]s (sperm). For pollination to occur, pollen grains must attach to the stigma of the female reproductive structure ([[carpel]]), where the female gametophytes (ovules) are located inside the [[ovary]]. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the [[sex]] cell nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and endosperm nuclei within the female gametophyte in a process termed [[double fertilization]]. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus two female cells) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a [[fruit]], which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]] or [[pollination|cross-pollinate]].

Nonflowering plants like [[fern]]s, [[moss]] and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s use other means of sexual reproduction.

In 2013, flowers dating from the [[Cretaceous]] (100 million years before present) were found encased in amber, the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma. The pollen was sticky, suggesting it was carried by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George O |last=Poinar Jr. |first2=Kenton L |last2=Chambers |first3=Joerg |last3=Wunderlich |title=Micropetasos, a new genus of angiosperms from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=J.

===Ferns===
Ferns mostly produce large diploid [[sporophyte]]s with [[rhizome]]s, roots and leaves; and on fertile leaves called [[sporangium]], [[spore]]s are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or [[thallus]], produce both motile sperm in the [[antheridia]] and egg cells in separate [[archegonia]]. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the archegonia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. A [[zygote]] is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporephyte and gametophyte plants is called [[alternation of generation]]s. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the  ''[[Psilotum]]'', ''[[Lycopodium]]'', ''[[Selaginella]]'' and ''[[Equisetum]]''.

===Bryophytes===
The [[bryophyte]]s, which include [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[hornwort]]s and [[moss]]es, reproduce both sexually and [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]]. They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with [[flagella]] and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antherida respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing a zygote.  The [[zygote]] divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid.  The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules, which are connected by [[seta]] to the archegonia. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, when ripe the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. Also in some species each plant is one sex while other species produce both sexes on the same plant.&lt;ref&gt;

==Fungi==
{{Main|Mating in fungi}}
{{further|Fungus#Reproduction}}
[[File:Puffballs emitting spores.jpg|thumb|309x309px|Puffballs emitting spores]]
[[Fungi]] are classified by the methods of sexual reproduction they employ.  The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of [[resting spore]]s that are used to survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: [[plasmogamy]], [[karyogamy]] and [[meiosis]]. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during plasmogamy and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores.

==Bacteria and archaea==
Three distinct processes in [[prokaryote]]s are regarded as similar to [[Origin and function of meiosis|eukaryotic sex]]: [[bacterial transformation]], which involves the incorporation of foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome; [[bacterial conjugation]], which is a transfer of [[plasmid]] DNA between bacteria, but the plasmids are rarely incorporated into the bacterial chromosome; and [[Prokaryote#Gene transfer|gene transfer and genetic exchange in archaea]].

Bacterial transformation involves the [[genetic recombination|recombination of genetic material]] and its function is mainly associated with [[Sexual recombination#Recombinational repair|DNA repair]]. Bacterial transformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.&lt;ref name="Michod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis|year=2010|last1=Bernstein|first1=Harris|last2=Bernstein|first2=Carol|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=7|pages=498–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 40 bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7968924|year=1994|last1=Lorenz|first1=MG|last2=Wackernagel|first2=W|title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment|volume=58|issue=3|pages=563–602|pmc=372978|journal=Microbiological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state referred to as competence (see [[Natural competence]]). Sexual reproduction in early single-celled eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation,&lt;ref name="Bernstein2"&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE.

Open access for reading only. {{ISBN|978-1-62100-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from a similar process in archaea (see below).

On the other hand, bacterial conjugation is a type of direct transfer of DNA between two bacteria through an external appendage called the conjugation pilus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22986519|year=2012|last1=Lodé|first1=T|title=Have Sex or Not?

'''Sharecare''' is a health and wellness engagement platform that provides consumers with personalized information, programs and resources to improve their health. It provides personalized information  to the site's users based on their responses to the RealAge Test, the company's  health risk assessment tool, and  offers a clinical decision support tool, AskMD.  Headquartered in Atlanta, Sharecare was founded in 2010 by [[Jeff Arnold (Internet entrepreneur)|Jeff Arnold]] (founder of [[WebMD]]) and [[Mehmet Oz|Dr. Mehmet Oz]], in partnership with [[Harpo Studios]], [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[Discovery Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07adco.html |title=Web Site to Offer Health Advice, Some of It From Marketers |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-04-02 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=HSWI:US&amp;sid=ac9dCGVDwxLU|title=Dr. Mehmet Oz and Internet Entrepreneur, Jeff Arnold, Announce Sharecare Inc., a Web 3.0 Platform, Organizing and Answering the Questions of Health|date=November 2, 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharecare.com is built on a social content platform curating the collective knowledge of vetted medical experts. Much of its content is contributed by organizations like [[AARP]], the [[American Cancer Society]], the [[American Heart Association]], the [[American Red Cross]], the [[National Academy of Sports Medicine]], and medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07adco.html |title= Web Site to Offer Health Advice, Some of It From Marketers |publisher=’’The New York Times’’ |date=2010-10-06 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions are also answered by medical centers such as the [[Cleveland Clinic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/zinamoukheiber/2010/11/16/names-you-need-to-know-in-2011-sharecare/ |title= Names You Need To Know In 2011: Sharecare |publisher=Forbes|date=2010-11-16|first=Zina|last=Moukheiber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  platform allows them to answer questions and engage in conversations about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthin30.com/2010/10/dr-mehmet-oz-and-jeff-arnold-launch-sharecare-com-where-experts-share-their-knowledge-with-consumers/ |title= Dr. Mehmet Oz and Jeff Arnold launch Sharecare.com, where experts share their knowledge with consumers |publisher=Health in 30 |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AskMD, launched in December 2013, is a web-based application, (and a free app for iPhone and iPod touch), that helps people collect information about symptoms, learn more about   causes, and find appropriate physicians. AskMD aims to help consumers get organized around their health and have a more productive doctor's visit by guiding users through a personalized questionnaire that takes into account symptoms and other factors, like medications and known conditions, and matches answers against the latest clinical research. AskMD’s clinical knowledge management system was developed through Sharecare’s acquisition of PKC Corporation, to bring evidence-based medicine to patients and providers, and enabling clinically-informed communications. It  was  named Best Medical App at the 4th Annual Appy Awards, and was named an official 2014 Webby Award honoree in Mobile &amp; Apps: Health &amp; Fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/05/23/sharecares-askmd-wins-appy-award-for-best-medical-app/ |title=Sharecare’s AskMD Wins Appy Award for Best Medical App |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://medcitynews.com/2014/04/mobile-health-apps-ehr-diabetes-picked-webby-award-honorees/ |title=Mobile health apps from EHR to diabetes picked as Webby award honorees |publisher=MedCityNews |date=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinistral''' and '''dextral''', in some scientific fields, are the two types of [[chirality]] ("[[handedness]]") or [[relative direction]].

The terms are derived from the [[Latin]] words for "left" (''sinister'') and "right" (''dexter'').

Other disciplines have different terms (such as [[Dextrorotary|dextro-]] and [[Laevorotary|laevo-rotary]], in [[Chirality (chemistry)|chemistry]], or [[Clockwise#Usage|clockwise]] and [[anticlockwise]] in [[Chirality (electromagnetism)|physics]]) or simply use left and right (as in [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|anatomy]]).

Relative direction and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction is from the point of view of the observer. A completely symmetrical object has a left and a right side, from the observer's point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a right-hand screw thread, it remains different from a left-hand screw thread. Therefore, a symmetrical object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an object that has chirality can have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, no matter the position of the observer.

[[Image:strike slip fault.png|thumb|218px|right|Schematic illustration of the two strike-slip fault types. The view is of the Earth's surface from above.]]
In geology the terms '''sinistral''' and '''dextral''' refer to the horizontal component of movement of blocks on either side of a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] or the sense of movement within a [[shear zone]]. These are terms of relative direction, as the movement of the blocks are described relative to each other when viewed from above. 
Movement is sinistral (left-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the left, or if straddling the fault the left side moves toward the observer.
Movement is dextral (right-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the right, or if straddling the fault the right side moves toward the observer.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;

===Gastropods===
{{main|Gastropod shell}}

Because the coiled shells of gastropods are asymmetrical, they possess a quality called [[chirality]], the "handedness" of an asymmetrical structure.

of gastropod species have '''dextral''' (right-handed) shells in their coiling.  A small minority of species and genera are almost always '''sinistral''' (left-handed).  A very few species show an even mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals (for example, ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm ''Amphidromus perversus'' (Linnaeus, 1758)]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Flatfish===
{{main|Flatfish}}

The most obvious characteristic of flatfish, other than their flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes are on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes are always on the right side of the body ('''dextral''' or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are always on the left ('''sinistral''' or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive [[spiny turbot]]s include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author1=Chapleau, Francois  |author2=Amaoka, Kunio |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= xxx|isbn= 0-12-547665-5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social alienation''' is "a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of [[social interaction|integration]] or [[Value (ethics)|common values]] and a high degree of distance or [[social isolation|isolation]] between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment".&lt;ref name="robertankony.net"&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement", ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management'', vol. 22, no. 2 (1999): 120–32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[sociology|sociological]] concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Esp., [[Emile Durkheim]], 1951, 1984; [[Erich Fromm]], 1941, 1955; [[Karl Marx]], 1846, 1867; [[Georg Simmel]], 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin-Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has many discipline-specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively).

==History==
The term ''alienation'' has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense of achieving a higher state of [[contemplation]], [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] or union—becoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to [[neoplatonic]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] (in the Greek ''alloiosis''). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The [[New Testament]] mentions the term ''apallotrioomai'' in Greek—"being alienated from". Ideas of estrangement from a [[Golden Age]], or due to a [[fall of man]], or approximate equivalents in differing [[cultures]] or [[religions]], have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as [[Gnosticism]].

Alienation has also had a particular [[legal]]-[[political]] meaning since at least [[Ancient Roman]] times, where to [[Alienation (property law)|alienate]] property (''alienato'') is to transfer [[ownership]] of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'' which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from ''alius'', meaning "other" or "another". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by [[physicians]] referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced [[physiology]]. In Latin ''alienatio mentis'' (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]].&lt;ref&gt;E Regis (1895) [http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14035276M/A_practical_manual_of_mental_medicine A practical manual of mental medicine] 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E. Régis; with a preface by [[Benjamin Ball (physician)|M. Benjamin Ball]]; authorized translation by H.M. Bannister; with introduction by the author. Published 1895 by Blakiston in Philadelphia. Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Utica asylum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to [[Felix Platter]].

In [[medieval]] times, a relationship between alienation and [[social order]] has been described, mediated in part by [[mysticism]] and [[monasticism]]. The [[Crusades]] and [[witch-hunts]] have been described as forms of mass alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), "Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order," Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233–259 (stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/pss/2854675)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th century &lt;!--Linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
In the 17th century, [[Hugo Grotius]] put forward the concept that everyone has '[[Sovereignty|sovereign]] authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early [[social contract]] theory. In the 18th century, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] introduced a distinction between [[Natural and legal rights|alienable and unalienable rights]] in the legal sense of the term. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a [[state of nature]] due to the expansion of [[civil society]] or the [[nation state]].

In the same century a law of [[alienation of affection]] was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman.

In the history of literature, the [[German Romantics]] appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.&lt;ref&gt;Rado Pribic (2008) [http://dspace.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/660 Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism], Lafayette College, Easton, PA&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 19th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] popularized a Christian ([[Lutheran]]) and [[Idealist]] philosophy of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/alienation/v-1 "Alienation".]&lt;/ref&gt; He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the [[self]] was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good.

Around the same time, [[Philippe Pinel|Pinel]] was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his '[[moral treatment]]' approach, and developed related theories.&lt;ref&gt;Dora B.

Two camps formed following Hegel, the [[Young Hegelians|'young' or 'left' Hegelians]] who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the [[Right Hegelians|'old' or 'right' Hegelians]] who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self.

===Marx===
{{Main|Marx's theory of alienation}}
Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's [[dialectic]] model to a theory of [[historical materialism|(historical) materialism]]. [[Marx's theory of alienation]] is articulated most clearly in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' and ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846). The [[Young Marx|'young' Marx]] wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-[[anthropological]] ([[Marxist humanism]]) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a [[structural]]-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Vandenberghe [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEpXcGXP274C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Philosophical History of German Sociology] Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by [[Kostas Axelos]]: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the ''economic and social alienation'' aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of [[capitalism]]. Essentially, there is an "exploitation of men by men" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging [[industry|industrial]] production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the [[human being]]. [[Max Stirner|Stirner]] would take the analysis further in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in ''The German Ideology'' (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in [[labour (economics)|work]] each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism "work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products." "The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.".&lt;ref&gt;Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purdue, William D., ''Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology'', Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell Ollman (1976) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Ac4AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society] Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of ''Political Alienation'' refers to the idea that "politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy" in a way that is alienating because it "distorts the logic of economic development".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Human Alienation'', individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where "they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls "historical conditions." The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more "needs" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 113)&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to ''ideological alienation'', Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from "their true happiness" and instead turn them towards "illusory happiness".&lt;ref&gt;(Axelos, 1976: 161-162)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word ''alienation'', and similar words such as ''estrangement'', are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, ''[[:de:Entfremdung|Entfremdung]]'' and ''[[:de:Entäußerung|Entäußerung]]''. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote "''Entfremdung''...constitutes the real interest of this ''Entäußerung''."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Arthur (1986), ''The Dialectics of Labor'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1800s to 1900s===
Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] wrote critical works on [[individualism|individualization]] and [[urbanization]]. Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. Tönnies' ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]'' (''Community and Society'') is about the loss of primary relationships such as [[family|familial]] bonds in favour of [[Objective (goal)|goal]]-oriented, secondary [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account.

The American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]'' in 1951, describing how modern consumption-capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, "On the Meaning of Alienation", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7–8).  Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement," ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work.

In a broader [[philosophy|philosophical]] context, especially in [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], alienation describes the inadequacy of the human [[being]] (or the [[mind]]) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s of individuals when faced with life choices. Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by [[Kierkegaard]]'s notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] described the "thing-in-itself" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is "reflective consciousness". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the [[human condition]]). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the "Other"  (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their [[self-consciousness]] has a "masochistic desire" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play ''[[No Exit]]'', "Hell is other people".

In the theory of [[psychoanalysis]] developed around the start of the 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and [[unconscious mind]], between different parts of a hypothetical [[psychic apparatus]], and between the self and [[civilization]]. It postulates [[defense mechanisms]], including [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of [[Psychological repression|repression]] has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of [[false consciousness]] associated with Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Geyer]] (2001) [http://www.unizar.es/sociocybernetics/chen/felix/pfge15.pdf Alienation, Sociology of] in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

A form of [[Western Marxism]] developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by [[György Lukács]]. Critics of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[Protestant Ethic]] also drew on the works of [[Max Weber]].

Figures associated with [[critical theory]], in particular with the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Erich Fromm]], also developed theories of alienation, drawing on [[neo-Marxist]] ideas as well as other influences including [[neo-Freudian]] and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of [[commodification]] to the cultural, educational and [[Political party|party-political]] spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) [http://www.kritike.org/journal/issue_6/pangilinan_december2009.pdf Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm] Kritike, Vol3, No2&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s the revolutionary group [[Situationist International]] came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to [[advanced capitalism]], the latter conceptualized as a diffuse '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. [[The Theory of Communicative Action]] associated with [[Jürgen Habermas]] emphasizes the essential role of [[language]] in [[public sphere|public life]], suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of [[Market (economics)|market]] forces and [[State (polity)|state]] power.

This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;Dahms, H. "Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory." In [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIZctokjRlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation]. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA).  In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[globalization]], the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and [[post-modernism]] (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world.

==Powerlessness==
Alienation in the sense of a lack of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] has been technically defined by Seeman as "the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks." Seeman argues that this is "the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the [[prerogative]] and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 784)&lt;/ref&gt;  More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, "A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing".

In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist [[Julian Rotter]]. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external [[locus of control]], which means "differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1966: 355)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals.

More recently, Geyer&lt;ref&gt;Geyer (1996: xxiii)&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that "a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an [[overchoice]] of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom". Geyer adapts [[cybernetics]] to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed [[feedback]]: "The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions.  Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with [[apathy]] and alienation as a result".

==Meaninglessness==
A sense of [[meaning (existential)|meaning]] has been defined by Seeman as "the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 786)&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness "is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made." Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes.  In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to [[powerlessness]]; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, "the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)".

Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: "With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal-relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis."  "[[Information overload]]" or the so-called "data tsunami" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head.

==Normlessness==
Normlessness (or what [[Durkheim]] referred to as [[anomie]]) "denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;(Seeman, 1959: 787)&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, "The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals".  This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime.

Neal &amp; Collas (2000: 122) write, "Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms.  Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct".  This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: "The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well.  The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily "negative": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded.

==Relationships==
One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of [[parental alienation]], where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have [[divorced]] or [[legal separation|separated]]).  The term is not applied where there is [[child abuse]]. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the [[social dynamics]] of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of [[attachment theory|attachment]], the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. [[Adoptees]] can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjlifton.com/journey.htm Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial estrangement between parents and adult children "is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns." The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013).

Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents.DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.013.919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, A. S. (2003).

[[Attachment in adults|Attachment relationships in adults]] can also involve feelings of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamft.org/imis15/Content/Consumer_Updates/Adult_Attachment_Relationships.aspx AAMFT Consumer Update]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a [[rat race|socioeconomic race]], or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rokach|first=Ami|title=Loneliness then and now: Reflections on social and emotional alienation in everyday life|journal=Current Psychology|year=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=24–40|doi=10.1007/s12144-004-1006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social isolation==
Social isolation refers to "The feeling of being segregated from one's community".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"&gt;(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97)&lt;/ref&gt; Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: "While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world.  With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships."

Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the [[Cold War]], migrants from [[Eastern Europe]] and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. [[Diaspora]] literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as [[Hafid Bouazza]] in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, "Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005.  The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits".

==Among returning war veterans==
{{POV-section|date=March 2017}}
Because of intense group solidarity and unique daily hardships brought by combat, many veterans feel alienated from citizens, family, and friends when they return. They often feel they have little in common with civilian peers; issues that concern friends and family seem trivial after combat.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, William M., "Trauma of Iraq war haunting thousands returning home," ''USA Today'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clarity of focus and purpose that comes with war that few in civilian life will ever know. Afghanistan veteran Brendon O'Byrne says, "We were really close. Physically and emotionally close. It's kind of terrifying being in such an emotionally safe environment and then suddenly be expelled into an alienated, fractured society."&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 26"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of re-entering a civilian life where few people have experienced combat may contribute to the sense of loneliness.&lt;ref name="Warfighter's paradox 27"&gt;Junger, Sebastian, "Warfighter's paradox", ''Army Times'', Washington, D.C., June 10, 2014, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As filmmaker and war correspondent Sebastian Junger says, "They didn't want to go back because it was traumatic, but because it was a place where they understood what they were supposed to do. They understood who they were. They had a sense of purpose. They were necessary. All these things that young people strive for are answered in combat."&lt;ref&gt;"Interview", ''Military History'', Weider History Group, Inc. Leesburg, VA, November 2012. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Veterans often see their wartime experience as the most selfless and meaningful period of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Some veterans have expressed the sentiment that "even in the quiet moments, war is brighter, louder, brasher, more fun, more tragic, more wasteful. More. More of everything."&lt;ref&gt;Mokenhaupt, Brian, [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26372/esq0307essay/ "I Miss Iraq. I Miss My Gun.

The experience of the Vietnam veteran was distinctly different from that of veterans of other American wars.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he completed his tour of duty, he usually severed all bonds with his unit and comrades. It was extremely rare for a veteran to write to his buddies who were still in combat, and (in strong contrast to the endless reunions of World War II veterans) for more than a decade it was even rarer for more than two or more of them to get together after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col. Dave, ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society,'' Time Warner Book Group, New York, NY (1996): 275-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Korean War veterans had no memorial and precious few parades, but they fought an invading army and they left behind them the free, healthy, thriving, and grateful nation of South Korea. No one spat on them or called them murderers or baby killers when they returned. Only the veterans of Vietnam have endured a concerted, organized, psychological attack by its own people. Never in American history, perhaps never in all of Western civilization, has an army suffered such an agony from its own people.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lt. Col.

That the Vietnam War was ultimately lost on April 30, 1975, furthered the sense of meaninglessness and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C, "Perspectives," ''Vietnam'' magazine, August 2002: 58–61.

==Political alienation==
One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the [[political system]]. Such [[political alienation]] could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in [[revolution]], [[reform]]ing behavior, or [[abstention]] from the political process, possibly due to [[voter apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Schwartz [https://books.google.com/books?id=7wOVheiteOkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Political Alienation and Political Behavior] Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept is [[policy alienation]], where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a [[policy]] programme being implemented.

==Self-estrangement==
Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider [[self-estrangement]] to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as "the psychological state of denying one's own interests – of seeking out [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying]], activities...".&lt;ref name="Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97"/&gt; It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], or [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the "self", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely "self" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: "the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness.  On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional [[discourse]]s themselves". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of "self-estrangement" rather than "social isolation"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement "has not weathered postmodern criticisms of [[essentialism]] and [[economic determinism]] well", the concept still has value if a [[Lacanian]] reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the [[concept of self]] between [[humanism]] and [[antihumanism]], [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]], or [[nature]] and [[nurture]].

==Mental disturbance==
Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from [[psychoanalytic]] theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as [[schizoid personality]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. [[R. D. Laing]] was particularly influential in arguing that [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]] and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and [[ontological security|ontological insecurity]] in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Frank (1975) [http://www.positivedisintegration.com/Johnson1975.pdf Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement] Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lysaker|first=P.

In a related vein, for [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]], psychology ''normalizes'' conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as [[critical psychology]] or [[liberation psychology]], which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DnX73bkC0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting] Introduction; Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavoj Zizek]] (drawing on [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to "enjoy!" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994).

[[Frantz Fanon]], an early writer on [[postcolonialism]], studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to [[mental disorders]] among the [[colonized]] in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961).

A process of '[[malignant]] alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the [[suicide]] of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation.

==Disability==
Differences between persons with [[disability|disabilities]] and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, "Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S. (1989), [http://sfaa.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,5,10;journal,90,279;linkingpublicationresults,1:113218,1 Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness], ''Human Organization'', Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226–235&lt;/ref&gt; found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: [[social rejection]] by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in [[marginalization]] of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative.

Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.&lt;ref&gt;Janice L. Willms [http://www.annals.org/content/126/11/923.extract Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion] Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Younger|first=JB|title=The alienation of the sufferer.|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=June 1995|volume=17|issue=4|pages=53–72|pmid=7625781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Alienation is most often represented in [[literature]] as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for [[Achilles]] in the ''[[Iliad]]''. In addition, ''[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]'' is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', ''[[Black Boy]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Chosen (Potok novel)|The Chosen]]'', ''[[Dubliners]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'', ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', ''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'', ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', ''[[The Waste Land]]'', and ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQLTOk18LwMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation] Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include ''[[The Child in Time]]'', ''[[London Fields (novel)|London Fields]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', and ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'' (Senekal, 2008 &amp; 2010b: 102–123).

Sociologist [[Harry Dahms]] has analysed [[The Matrix Trilogy]] of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of ''[[The Matrix]]'' is the "all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;Harry F. Dahms [http://web.utk.edu/~hdahms/Emergence.pdf THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation.] Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also Langman's study of ''punk, porn, and resistance'' (2008) and Senekal's (2011) study of [[Afrikaans]] [[extreme metal]].

British [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]'s concept album ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and British [[alternative rock]] band [[Radiohead]]'s album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

==Introduction==
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg. When this is done, the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote. The blastocyst stage is developed by the egg which helps to create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic cell nuclear transfer {{!}} biology and technology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/somatic-cell-nuclear-transfer|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=27 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first animal that was developed by this technique was Dolly, the sheep, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer - Embryology|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Somatic_Cell_Nuclear_Transfer|website=embryology.med.unsw.edu.au|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, known as the ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to the cells of the human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum.&lt;ref name="Pattinson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017-09-12|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is [[Reprogramming|reprogrammed]] by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a [[blastocyst]] (an early stage [[embryo]] with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Applications==

=== Stem cell research ===
Somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in [[stem cell research]]. The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo. These cells [[Genetics|genetically]] matched the donor organism from which they came. This gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells, which could then be used in therapies or disease research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos. Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method.

A potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient's particular disease. By doing so, an ''in vitro'' model could be created, would be useful for studying that particular disease, potentially discovering its pathophysiology, and discovering therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals, questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum. Despite many attempts, success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited. There lies a problem in the human cell's ability to form a blastocyst; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development. This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development. These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success.

A research group from the [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully   using skin cells. The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II (MII) of the cell cycle. Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states. When the ovum's nucleus is removed, the cell loses its genetic information. This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability. It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes, enucleation negatively affects these factors. Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast, affecting reprogramming ability.

Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells. In May 2013, the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT, using fetal and infant donor cells. Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure, human clone embryos were successfully produced. These embryos were of poor quality, lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed [[trophectoderm]]. The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC. The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum's nucleus and injection of the somatic nucleus improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation. The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas, expressed pluripotent transcription factors, and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype, indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC-like.&lt;ref name="Tachibana"/&gt; This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells. This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC.

In April 2014, an international research team expanded on this break through. There remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells. Epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed. Implementing the procedure pioneered by the Oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by SCNT using adult cells from two donors, aged 35 and 75.Indicating age does not impede a cells ability to be reprogrammed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909%2814%2900137-4 Human Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Using Adult Cells] ''[[Cell Stem Cell]]''.

Late April 2014, the [[New York Stem Cell Foundation]] was successful in creating SCNT stem cells derived from adult somatic cells. One of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic. The group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation. When injected into mice, cells of all three of the germ layers successfully formed. The most significant of these cells, were those who expressed insulin and were capable of secreting the hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The impetus for SCNT-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cells]] were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based stem cell research: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases.&lt;ref name="2008 breakthrough"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gretchen Vogel|title=Breakthrough of the year: Reprogramming Cells|journal=Science |volume=322|issue=5909|pages=1766–1767|date=December 2008|doi=10.1126/science.322.5909.1766|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/322/5909/1766 |pmid=19095902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into.

=== Reproductive cloning ===
{{main|Cloning}}
[[File:ECM 2001 Hybridoma System.jpg|62 KBpx|thumbnail|BTX ECM 2001 Electrofusion generator used for SCNT and Cloning applications]]
This technique is currently the basis for [[cloning]] animals (such as the famous [[Dolly the sheep]]),&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with moral and ethical objections, reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Revel M |title=Research on animal cloning technologies and their implications in medical ethics: an update |journal=Med Law |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=527–43 |year=2000 |pmid=11143888 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rhind SM, Taylor JE, De Sousa PA, King TJ, McGarry M, Wilmut I |title=Human cloning: can it be made safe? |journal=Nat.

There is also the potential for treating diseases associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Recent studies show SCNT of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease. This treatment does not involve cloning but would produce a child with three genetic parents. A father providing a sperm cell, one mother providing the egg nucleus and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell.&lt;ref name="Pera" /&gt;

=== Interspecies nuclear transfer ===
Interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species, or even to restore species after their extinction. The technique is similar to SCNT [[cloning]] which typically is between domestic animals and rodents, or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals. However, the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning. Interspecies nuclear transfer utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus. In 2000, [[Robert Lanza]] was able to produce a cloned fetus of a [[gaur]], ''Bos gaurus'', combining it successfully with a domestic cow, ''Bos taurus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanza|first=Robert P.|author2=Jose B. Cibelli |author3=Francisca A. Diaz |author4=Carlos T. Moraes |author5=Peter W. Farin |author6=Charlotte E. Farin |author7=Carolyn J. Hammer |author8=Michael D. West |author9=Philip Damiani  |title=Cloning of an endangered species (Bos gaurus) using interspecies nuclear transfer|journal=Cloning|year=2000|volume=2|issue=2|pages=79–90|url=http://media.longnow.org/files/2/REVIVE/Cloning%20of%20an%20Endangered%20Species.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2013|doi=10.1089/152045500436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspecies nuclear transfer provides evidence of the universality of the triggering mechanism of the cell nucleus reprogramming. For example, Gupta et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Das | first2 = Z. C. | last3 = Heo | first3 = Y. T. | last4 = Uhm | first4 = S.

Moreover, NCSU23 medium, which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos, was able to support the in vitro development of cattle, mice, and chicken iSCNT embryos up to the [[blastocyst]] stage. Furthermore, ovine oocyte cytoplast may be used for remodeling and reprogramming of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosseini | first1 = S.

==Limitations==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
SCNT can be inefficient. Stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous, resulting in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells. For example, in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; As the procedure was not automated, but had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The [[biochemistry]] involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood. However, by 2014, researchers were reporting success rates of 70-80% with cloning pigs&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT derived tissues/organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant.

== Controversy ==
{{Further|stem cell controversy}}

[[Image:Human blastocyst.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Human [[Blastocyst]], showing the [[inner cell mass]] (top, right).]]
Proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo. These have led to some individuals and organizations who are ''not'' opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about, or opposed to, SCNT research.&lt;ref name="rifkin"&gt;[[Jeremy Rifkin]]. (February 18, 2002). [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020218/rifkin "Fusion Biopolitics".] ''The Nation''.

Andrews, et al., [http://geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=1958 Open Letter to US Senate on Human Cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122105524/http://geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=1958 |date=2010-11-22 }}, (March 19, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern is that blastula creation in SCNT-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction,&lt;ref name="Regulation"&gt;Lori B. Andrews et al. (March 19, 2002).[http://genetics-and-society.org/resources/cgs/2002_open_letter.html "Open Letter to US Senators on Human Cloning and Eugenic Engineering".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930074200/http://www.genetics-and-society.org/resources/cgs/2002_open_letter.html |date=2006-09-30 }} Retrieved on August 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or its prohibition.&lt;ref name="rifkin" /&gt;

A second important concern is the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human [[ovum|eggs]], which can only be obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].

One vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients. Each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient's own DNA, thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment. For example, to treat a man with Parkinson's disease, a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by SCNT into an egg cell from an egg donor, creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient's own cells. (There would be differences. For example, the mitochondrial DNA would be the same as that of the egg donor. In comparison, his own cells would carry the mitochondrial DNA of his mother.)

Potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy, and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line.  Such large numbers of donated eggs would exceed the number of eggs currently left over and available from couples trying to have children through [[assisted reproductive technology]]. Therefore, healthy young women would need to be induced to sell eggs to be used in the creation of custom stem cell lines that could then be purchased by the medical industry and sold to patients. It is so far unclear where all these eggs would come from.

Stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use on a large scale on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.

To address the problem of creating a human egg market, some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs. If successful, human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines.  However, this technology may be a long way off.

== Policies regarding human SCNT ==
SCNT involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], having been incorporated into the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="coghlan"&gt;Andy Coghlan, "[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1602 Cloning opponents fear loopholes in new UK law]", ''New Scientist'' (November 23, 2001, retrieved October 6, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattinson"/&gt; Permission must be obtained from the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] in order to perform or attempt SCNT.

In the United States, the practice remains legal, as it has not been addressed by federal law.&lt;ref name="NBAC"&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcbl/nbac/pubs/cloning1/chapter5.pdf "Chapter 5: Legal and Policy Considerations.

The '''spermatheca''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|k|ə}} plural: '''spermathecae''' {{IPAc-en|s|p|ɚ|m|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|s|iː}}), also called '''receptaculum seminis''' (plural: '''receptacula seminis'''), is an [[organ (biology)|organ]] of the female reproductive tract in [[insect]]s, e.g. [[bee]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Tales V. Pascini, and Gustavo F. Martins. 2017. "The insect spermatheca: an overview".

Some species of animal have multiple spermathecae.  For example, certain species of earthworms have four pairs of spermathecae—one pair each in the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th segments. The spermathecae receive and store the spermatozoa of another earthworm during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan A. Pechenik. Biology of the Invertebrates. New York: McGraw Hill, 2010, pg. 322&lt;/ref&gt; They are lined with [[epithelium]] and are variable in shape: some are thin, heavily coiled tubes, while others are vague outpocketings from the main reproductive tract. It is one of the many variations in sexual reproduction.

'''Superfecundation''' is the fertilization of two or more [[ovum|ova]] from the same [[menstrual cycle|cycle]] by [[spermatozoon|sperm]] from separate acts of [[sexual intercourse]], which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3851843/twins-complications/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter|title=The Science of How Women Can Have Twins With 2 Different Fathers|first=Justin|last=Worland|date=May 8, 2015|work=Time|accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sogc.org/publications-resources/public-information-pamphlets.html?id=33|title=Public Education Pamphlets|work=sogc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term superfecundation is derived from [[fecundity|fecund]], meaning the ability to produce offspring.  '''Heteropaternal superfecundation''' refers to the fertilization of two separate ova by two different fathers. '''Homopaternal superfecundation''' refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twins]].&lt;ref name=pmid10641935&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10641935 |year=2000 |author1=Ambach |first1=E |title=Superfecundation and dual paternity in a twin pregnancy ending with placental abruption |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=181–3 |last2=Parson |first2=W |last3=Brezinka |first3=C }}&lt;/ref&gt; While heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either separate occurrences of sexual intercourse or through artificial insemination.&lt;ref name=pmid26548710&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.10.930 |pmid=26548710 |title=A review of the mechanisms and evidence for typical and atypical twinning |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=214 |issue=2 |pages=172–91 |year=2016 |last1=McNamara |first1=Helen C. |last2=Kane |first2=Stefan C. |last3=Craig |first3=Jeffrey M. |last4=Short |first4=Roger V. |last5=Umstad |first5=Mark P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conception ==
Superfecundation most commonly happens within hours or days of the first instance of fertilization with ova released during the same cycle. The time window when eggs are able to be fertilized is small. Sperm cells can live inside a female's body for four to five days. Once ovulation occurs, the egg remains viable for 12–48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Thus, the fertile period can span five to seven days.

[[Ovulation]] is usually suspended during [[pregnancy]] to prevent further ova becoming fertilized and to help increase the chances of a full-term pregnancy. However, if an ovum is released after the female was already impregnated when previously ovulating, a chance of a second pregnancy occurs, albeit at a different stage of development. This is known as [[superfetation]].

==Heteropaternal superfecundation in mammals==
Heteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as cats and dogs. Stray dogs can produce litters in which every puppy has a different sire. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among [[dizygotic twin]]s whose parents had been involved in [[paternity suit]]s.&lt;ref name="suit"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1488855 |year=1992 |author1=Wenk |first1=R. E. |title=How frequent is heteropaternal superfecundation? |journal=Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |last2=Houtz |first2=T |last3=Brooks |first3=M |last4=Chiafari |first4=F. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases in mythology==
Greek mythology holds many cases of superfecundation:
* [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] lies with both her husband [[Tyndareus]] and [[Zeus]], the latter in the guise of a swan. Nine months later, she bares two daughters: [[Clytemnestra]] by Tyndareus and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] by Zeus. This happens again, this time Leda bares two sons: [[Castor and Pollux |Castor by Tyndareus and Pollux by Zeus]]. 

* [[Alcmene]] is raped by Zeus, who is disguised as her husband [[Amphitryon]]; the real Amphitryon later sleeps with Alcmene and she gives birth to two sons: [[Iphicles]] by Amphitryon and [[Heracles]] by Zeus.

==Selected cases involving superfecundation==

In 1982, twins who were born with two different skin colors were discovered to be conceived as a result of heteropaternal superfecundation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020008620&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=F6227767DB3CDB724EA92EFC60A5A985.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a2{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26548710/&gt;

In 1995, a young woman gave birth to [[diamniotic]] [[monochorionic]] twins, who were originally assumed to be monozygotic twins until a paternity suit led to a DNA test. This led to the discovery that the twins had different fathers.&lt;ref name=pmid10641935/&gt;

In 2001, a case of spontaneous monopaternal superfecundation was reported after a woman undergoing IVF treatments gave birth to quintuplets after only two embryos were implanted. Genetic testing supported that the twinning was not a result of the embryos splitting, and that all five boys shared the same father.&lt;ref name=pmid26548710/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(01)01976-8 |pmid=11532493 |title=Monopaternal superfecundation of quintuplets after transfer of two embryos in an in vitro fertilization cycle |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=621–3 |year=2001 |last1=Amsalem |first1=Hagai |last2=Tsvieli |first2=Rimona |last3=Zentner |first3=Bat Sheva |last4=Yagel |first4=Simcha |last5=Mitrani-Rosenbaum |first5=Stella |last6=Hurwitz |first6=Arye }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, an IVF-implanted surrogate mother gave birth to two children: one genetically unrelated child from an implanted embryo, and a biological child from her own egg and her husband's sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/03/health/surrogate-mom-two-babies/index.html|title=Surrogate mom delivers two babies, one her own|publisher=CNN|date=November 3, 2017|author=Susan Scutti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- This was made using Google Translate and the French article. (If those need to be cited, the URLs are [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatotranscriptome] and https://translate.google.com/#fr/en].) Because of this, some of the links may not work, and the whole article is in need of grammatical surgery. I fixed as much as I had the patience to, but that was unfortunately not much. For now though, it's better than nothing. --&gt;

[[File:Affymetrix-microarray.jpg|thumb|[[DNA microarray]] used to analyze the expression of human genes left mouse right.]]

The '''thanatotranscriptome''' denotes (in the fields of [[biochemistry]], [[microbiology]] and [[biophysics]] of [[thanatology]] and in particular [[forensic]]) all [[ribonucleic acid|RNA]] from the transcript of the part of [[genome]] still active or awakened in the internal organs of a dead body for 24 to 48 hours following the time of the [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Pozhitkov, A. E., Neme, R., Domazet-Loso, T., Leroux, B., Soni, S., Tautz, D., &amp; Noble, P. A. (2016). Thanatotranscriptome: genes actively expressed after organismal death. bioRxiv, 058305.&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers. Forensic science, medicine, and pathology, 11(4), 509-516 ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-015-9704-6 summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; (It was recently showed that in these 48 hours, some genes continue to be expressed in [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, producing the [[mRNA]] and that certain genes are expressed again that had been inhibited since the end of fetal development) &lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

== Thanatotranscriptomic Analysis ==
It can from a [[serology]] postmortem characterize [[transcriptome]] of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] particular cell type, or compare the transcriptomes between various conditions experimental.

It can be complementary to the analysis of [[thanatomicrobiome]] to better understand the process of transformation of the [[necromass]] in the days following the death;.&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Finley, S. J., Abidin, Z., &amp; Mulle, J. G. (2016) ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4764706/ The Thanatomicrobiome: A Missing Piece of the Microbial Puzzle of Death]''. Frontiers in microbiology, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Characterization and quantification of the transcriptome in a tissue "dead" given and conditions data can identify [[gene]]s assets, to determine the regulatory mechanisms of [[Gene Expression]] and set networks of gene expression.

== Analytical Techniques ==
The techniques commonly used for simultaneously measuring the concentration of a large number of different types of mRNA include [[biochip|Microarray]], high throughput sequencing said RNA [[RNA-Seq]].

== Scientific History ==
Clues to the existence of a post-mortem transcriptome existed at least since the beginning of the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Can, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Soni, S. (2015). ''The apoptotic thanatotranscriptome associated with the liver of cadavers''. Forensic science, medicine, and pathology, 11(4), 509-516.&lt;/ref&gt; but in [[scientific publications]] the word ''thanatotranscriptome'' seems to have been first proposed by Javan et al. in 2015;&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G. T., Kwon, I., Finley, S. J., &amp; Lee, Y. (2015). ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheree_Finley/publication/284233163_Progression_of_Thanatophagy_in_Cadaver_Brain_and_Heart_Tissues/links/567aa20308ae1e63f1df4dc3.pdf Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports].''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Washington]], Peter Noble, Alex Pozhitkov and their colleagues recently (2016) confirmed that up to 2 days (48 hours) after the death of mice or zebrafish, many genes still function in their [[Human body|body]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Anna (2016) “[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094644-hundreds-of-genes-seen-sparking-to-life-two-days-after-death/ ''Hundreds of genes seen sparking to life two days after death (The discovery that many genes are still working up to 48 hours after death has implications for organ transplants, forensics and our very definition of death)'']”; New Scientist, 21 juin 2016, commentant un article intitulé  “''Genes get active after death''” dont la référence est BioRxiv, DOI: 10.1101/058305; DOI: 10.1101/058370&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;changes in the quantities of [[mRNA]] in the body prove that hundreds of genes with very different functions awoke just after death 548 genes have thus awakened after the death of [[zebrafish]] and 515 in the [[laboratory mice]].&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
Among the genes which thus awake, there are genes involved in the development of the organism, including genes that are normally activated only ''[[in utero]]'' or ''[[in ovo]]'' (in the egg) during fetal development.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

== Applications ==
This information could possibly in the future lead to:

* Construct a definition both more accurate and nuanced phenomenon of "[[death]]";
* More precise time of death by the [[forensic]] (or a biologist or veterinarian in an [[EcoHealth]] investigation who needs information on hours or causes of poisoning, without the case of a [[zoonosis]] for example. &lt;br /&gt;We are far, but if we come to better understand the steps of this phenomenon in the [[Human]], a coroner could via a ''"postmortem serology"''&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, L. I., Tate, C. M., Knott, E. L., McDaniel, J. E., Rogers, S. S., Koons, B. W., ... &amp; Robertson, J. M. (2012).

Journal of Forensic Sciences, 57(4), 1051-1058 ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2012.02086.x/full summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in the future, according to the dosage of the mRNA, establish with greater precision the time since death (by hour, even in minutes rather than days, which can be useful for investigations to reconstruct the conditions of death&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;).
* Illuminate the phenomenon of [[cell death]] of [[apoptosis]] or the death of a body, and in particular the phenomenon of [[ischemia]] ([[myocardial]] including&lt;ref name= Herrera2013/&gt;) and its process [[healing]] or resilience, for perhaps then to facilitate them. &lt;br /&gt;This gene revival also means remaining in the cells for up to 48 hours after the death of these animals enough energy for activating the cellular machinery.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; At least part of these genes appear to be genes involved in physiological healing, healing or "auto-resuscitation".&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
* Understand cancer. It was found that among the genes reactivated soon after death, some of the genes involved in the process of [[cancerous]] (reactivated with a peak of activity reaches about 24 hours after death&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;) ; detailed understanding of this phenomenon could shed light on the phenomenon of carcinogenesis and maybe bring some new elements to better combat.
* Improving the quality of organ transplants. Indeed, the fact that cancer-related genes are activated after the death in animals is information that leads us to consider the time of organ transplantation to reduce the incidence of cancer in people receiving these transplants.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; Persons to which was grafted a new liver actually more cancers after treatment than would be statistically normal. This phenomenon was attributed to the diet imposed on them, or immunosuppressive drugs they receive for their body does not reject the transplant.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; One hypothesis (yet to be verified) is that the cancer genes activated in the [[liver]] of the [[organ donation|donor]] may also play a role.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;
* Whether there is the same in humans, because previous studies have already shown that in people dead by trauma, heart attack or suffocation, various genes including those involved in cardiac muscle contraction and wound healing, were active more than 12 hours after death.&lt;ref name= Herrera2013&gt;González-Herrera, L., Valenzuela, A., Marchal, J. A., Lorente, J. A., &amp; Villanueva, E. (2013). Studies on RNA integrity and gene expression in human myocardial tissue, pericardial fluid and blood, and its postmortem stability. Forensic science international, 232(1), 218-228 ([http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(13)00378-2/abstract summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly for gene dental pulp.&lt;ref&gt;Poór, V.

International journal of legal medicine, 130(3), 615-619 ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1295-y summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors in 2015 introduced the concept of ''"thanatotranscriptome [[apoptosis|apoptotic]]"''&lt;ref&gt;Javan, G.

* Test another hypothesis is that after death, a rapid decrease of the "suppressor genes" activity (which normally inhibit the activation of other genes, including those no longer needed after the fetal stage) would allow dormant genes wake up, at least for this short period of time.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

The '''value of life''' is an economic [[value theory|value]] used to quantify the benefit of avoiding a fatality.&lt;ref name="DPMC" /&gt; It is also referred to as the cost of life, value of preventing a fatality (VPF) and implied cost of averting a fatality (ICAF). In [[social science|social]] and [[political science]]s, it is the [[marginal cost]] of death prevention in a certain class of circumstances. In many studies the value also includes the quality of life, the expected life time remaining, as well as the earning potential of a given person especially for an after the fact payment in a [[wrongful death claim]] [[lawsuit]].

As such, it is a statistical term, the cost of reducing the [[average]] number of deaths by one. It is an important issue in a wide range of disciplines including [[economics]], [[health care]], [[adoption]], [[political economy]], [[insurance]], [[worker safety]], [[environmental impact assessment]], and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

In industrial nations, the justice system considers a human life "priceless", thus illegalizing any form of slavery; i.e., humans cannot be bought at any price. However, with a limited supply of [[natural resource|resources]] or [[infrastructural capital]] (e.g. ambulances), or skill at hand, it is impossible to save every life, so some trade-off must be made. Also, this argument neglects the statistical context of the term. It is not commonly attached to lives of individuals or used to compare the value of one person's life relative to another person's. It is mainly used in circumstances of saving lives as opposed to taking lives or "producing" lives.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

==Treatment in economics==
There is no standard concept for the value of a specific human life in [[economics]]. However, when looking at risk/reward trade-offs that people make with regard to their health, economists often consider the value of a statistical life (VSL). The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] does not place a dollar value on individual lives. Rather, when conducting a cost-benefit analysis of new environmental policies, the Agency uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.These estimates of willingness to pay for small reductions in mortality risks are often referred to as the value of a statistical life (VSL).&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation| title=Mortality Risk Valuation| publisher=EPA| language=en|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VSL is the value that an individual places on a [[Marginal concepts|marginal]] change in their likelihood of death. Note that the VSL is very different from the value of an actual life.  It is the value placed on changes in the likelihood of death, not the price someone would pay to avoid certain death. This is best explained by way of an example. From the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]'s website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose each person in a sample of 100,000 people were asked how much he or she would be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risk of dying of 1 in 100,000, or 0.001%, over the next year. Since this reduction in risk would mean that we would expect one fewer death among the sample of 100,000 people over the next year on average, this is sometimes described as "one statistical life saved.” Now suppose that the average response to this hypothetical question was $100. Then the total dollar amount that the group would be willing to pay to save one statistical life in a year would be $100 per person × 100,000 people, or $10 million. This is what is meant by the "value of a statistical life.” &lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Economists often estimate the VSL by looking at the risks that people are voluntarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankiw|first=Gregory|title=Principles of Economics|date=2012|isbn=978-0-538-45305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of studies, which look at a person's actual choices, are known as [[revealed preference]] studies.  A common source of such choices is the labor market, where jobs with greater risk of death are seen to correlate with higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-08/documents/ee-0563-1.pdf| title=Valuing Mortality Risk Reductions for Environmental Policy| publisher=US EPA| date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of this research uses a wage [[Hedonic regression|hedonic]] approach, which looks at how wages change with changes in job characteristics.  Such studies [[Regression analysis|regress]] wages on job characteristics like risk of death, occupation, industry, risk of injury, location, etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}   By [[Independent variable#Controlled experiments|controlling]] for as many job characteristics as possible, researchers hope to tease out the portion of the wage that is compensating for the risk of death on the job. A recent summary of this literature is the 2003 paper by [[W. Kip Viscusi|Viscusi]] and Aldy.&lt;ref name=ViscusiAldy&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Viscusi|first1=W. Kip| first2=Joseph E.| last2=Aldy| title=The Value of a Statistical Life: A Critical Review of Market Estimates Throughout the World | journal= Journal of Risk and Uncertainty |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=5–76 |doi=10.1023/A:1025598106257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method economists can use to estimate the VSL is by simply asking people (e.g. through questionnaires) how much they would be willing to pay for a reduction in the likelihood of dying, perhaps by purchasing safety improvements. These types of studies are referred to as [[Choice modelling#Stated preference|stated preference]] studies. A well known problem with this method is the so-called "[[hypothetical bias]]", whereby people tend to overstate their valuation of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=James|author2=P. Geoffrey Allen|author3=Thomas H. Stevens|author4=Darryl Weatherhead|last-author-amp=yes|title=A Meta-analysis of Hypothetical Bias in Stated Preference Valuation|journal=Environmental and Resource Economics|date=August 2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=313–325|doi=10.1007/s10640-004-3332-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy applications of the VSL===
VSL estimates from wage hedonics are what the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] uses when evaluating health benefits from programs. From the EPA's:

:''Beginning in 2004 EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) used an estimate of $5.5 million (1999 dollars; $6.6 million in 2006 dollars) for the analysis of air regulations. This estimate was derived from the range of values estimated in three [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of VSL conducted after EPA's Guidelines were published in 2000 (Mrozek and Taylor (2000), Viscusi and Aldy (2003), and later, Kochi, et al. (2006).) However, the Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board (SAB) or other peer-review group.''&lt;ref name="EPA" /&gt;

Data for these studies frequently include wage data from the [[Current Population Survey]] and workplace risk data from the [http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cfoi.toc.htm Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries].  Both sets of data are collected on behalf of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mrozek|first=J.R.|author2=Laura Taylor |title=What Determines the Value of Life? A Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=2001|volume=21|issue=2|pages=253–270.|doi=10.1002/pam.10026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [http://www.epa.gov/oar/sect812/copy.html EPA's retrospective study of the clean air act], which focused "primarily on the criteria pollutants sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, ozone, and lead", found that the benefits of the program, mostly from improvements to health, outweighed the costs:

:''The direct benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990 include reduced incidence of a number of adverse human health effects, improvements in visibility, and avoided damage to agricultural crops. Based on the assumptions employed, the estimated economic value of these benefits ranges from $5.6 to $49.4 trillion, in 1990 dollars, with a mean, or central tendency estimate, of $22.2 trillion. These estimates do not include a number of other potentially important benefits which could not be readily quantified, such as ecosystem changes and air toxics-related human health effects. The estimates are based on the assumption that correlations between increased air pollution exposures and adverse health outcomes found by epidemiological studies indicate causal relationships between the pollutant exposures and the adverse health effects.''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

:''The direct costs of implementing the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990, including annual compliance expenditures in the private sector and program implementation costs in the public sector, totaled $523 billion in 1990 dollars.''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The value of improvements to health conditions were converted to dollars by estimating the resulting decrease in the incidence of fatalities and valuing this change using estimations of the VSL from the literature. A table of specific values used for the various improvements in health can be found in the report's [http://www.epa.gov/oar/sect812/1970-1990/812exec2.pdf executive summary].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Tobacco industry==
The cigarette industry was particularly concerned with value of life calculations since it came under regular attack in the 1980s and 1990s for the "social cost" of smoking on the national economy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}   The economic argument for increasing excise taxes on cigarettes was that these taxes compensated the state for a whole range of [[Externality|externalities]] that smoking imposed, including the costs of hospital and medical care for smokers and non-smokers alike, disability pensions for smoking-related diseases, welfare payments made to surviving spouses, the cost of street, home and office cleaning, the burden of home and forest fires, etc. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

To counter this argument, the tobacco industry was increasingly forced to fall back on calculations made by a network of employed academics, who were paid to write op-ed articles for their local newspapers expressing the opinion that smokers already 'paid their way'.  [http://sciencecorruption.com/ATN167/01713.html]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  They relied on an argument by Kip Viscusi which became known as the "death benefits"—the idea that, since smokers died earlier than non-smokers, the nation was being saved hospital, pension and nursing-home costs, and that these offset many of the external costs (depending on how these are calculated).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Since resources are finite, [[trade-off]]s are inevitable, even regarding potential life-or-death decisions. The assignment of a value to individual life is one possible approach to attempting to make [[rational decision]]s about these trade-offs.

When deciding on the appropriate level of healthcare spending, a typical method is to equate the marginal cost of the healthcare to the marginal benefits received. In order to obtain a marginal benefit amount, some estimation of the dollar value of life is required.
However the level that can be done is limited by available resources.  So even though it may be 'beneficial' to spend more it is not possible, or else requires deficit spending which causes other intended consequences that are hoped to be less{{needs citation|date=August 2018}}.

The rational strategy is to determine how much can be spent on saving lives and then allocating it to the most beneficial ways until the money is fully allocated.

In [[risk management]] activities such as in the areas of [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]], and insurance, it is often useful to put a precise economic value on a given life. There can be no such thing as a perfectly safe or risk free system—one can always make a system safer by spending more money. However, there are [[production theory basics|diminishing returns]] involved.

In transportation modes it is very important to consider the [[external cost]] that is paid by the society but is not calculated, for making it more [[sustainable]]. The external cost, although consisting of impacts on [[climate]], [[crops]] and [[public health]] among others, is largely determined by impacts on [[mortality rate]].

==Estimates of the value of life==
Equivalent parameters are used in many countries, with significant variation in the value assigned.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Miller| first=Ted R| title=Variations between Countries in Values of Statistical Life| journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy| volume=34| pages=169–188| date=May 2000| url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/e-journals/jtep/pdf/Volume_34_Part_2_169-188.pdf| issn=0022-5258| access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
According to different estimates life value in Russia varies from $40,000 up to $2 million. On the results of opinion poll life value (as the cost of financial compensation for the death) in the beginning of 2015 was about $71,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rgs.ru/media/CSR/on_startup/Life_value_2015.pdf|title = Стоимость человеческой жизни в России в 2015 году составила 4,5 млн. рублей|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Center for Strategic Researches RGS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18001">'''Voodoo death''', a term coined by [[Walter Cannon]] in 1942 also known as '''psychogenic death''' or '''psychosomatic death''', is the phenomenon of sudden [[death]] as brought about by a strong emotional shock, such as fear. The anomaly is recognized as "psychosomatic" in that death is caused by an emotional response—often fear—to some suggested outside force. Voodoo death is particularly noted in native societies, and [[concentration camp|concentration]]- or [[prisoner of war camps]], but the condition is not specific to any particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idStumpfe1979|Stumpfe, K.D. "The psychogenic death of Mr. J. A case report."]] pp. 263–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter Cannon and his work==
In 1942, [[Walter Bradford Cannon]], MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern [[physiological psychology]], published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;[[#Reference-idCannon1942|Cannon, Walter. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of [[supernatural]] consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives.

What Cannon describes has since been termed "bone-pointing syndrome," wherein an individual receives some sort of shock—often the breaking of some social/religious taboo—that he interprets as an ill omen for himself; his physical condition then deteriorates at a rapid rate, and he dies within a period as short as 24 hours after the initial shock.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon discusses the example of a [[Māori people|Maori]] woman who learned that the fruit she had eaten came from a [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] (tabooed) place; less than 24 hours later she was dead. Conversely, Cannon also shares the example of a young man who had fallen ill when the local witch doctor had pointed a bone at him, a societal taboo that meant a curse of death; however, when the perpetrator explained to the young man that the whole thing had been a mistake, and that no bone had been pointed at him at all, the young man's health returned instantly.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

Cannon notes the similarities in each case: the individuals were both members of a society where beliefs in the supernatural are fiercely upheld, and both had suffered what they both believed to be some form of a [[curse]] as dictated within their personal beliefs; also, the individuals shared similar physical symptoms. And yet, in the case of the young man, once the cause for the psychological distress was removed, his mysterious illness disappeared. Cannon attributes these rather drastic physical repercussions as the workings of the emotion fear upon the mind which then leads to destruction of the physical condition.&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

==Causes==
===Cannon's explanation===
According to Cannon, the emotion of fear working on the mind, which he terms the "sympathetic" or "sympathico-adrenal" division of the nervous system, causes a fall in blood pressure as brought on by "a reduction of the volume of circulating blood".&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt; Cannon explains the loss of blood volume by the constant injection of adrenaline into the small arterioles which constrict, preventing a proper flow of blood within the body and causing a drop in blood pressure. From there, the weak blood pressure prevents the sufficient circulation of the blood by damaging the heart and nerves responsible for the maintenance of the vessels which transport blood, thus making it harder for circulation to continue since the very organs necessary to maintain proper blood circulation are deteriorating. An accelerated heart rate then ensues, followed by rapid breathing. Added to these symptoms are the effects of no food or drink in the person experiencing psychological distress: Cannon suggests that true shock, in the medical sense, could be the cause of death as a result of little food or drink. States Cannon: "The combination of lack of food and water, anxiety, very rapid pulse and respiration, associated with a shocking experience having persistent effects, would fit well with fatal conditions reported from primitive tribes."&lt;ref name="Cannon"/&gt;

===Modern explanations===
Since 1942, scientists have discovered many more of the processes involved in the effect of stress upon the body, such as the region of the brain called the [[amygdala]]. The series of events by which a sensory stimulus is introduced to the mind, and the amygdala processes the emotion of fear which follows is called the "vision-to-fear pathway", or the "auditory-to-fear pathway", depending on the stimulus.

The generally recognized sequence of events, as enumerated by Esther M. Sternberg, MD, in 2002, stands as follows: various chemicals and electrical impulses are released that are transmitted by nerve fibers. Simultaneously, hormones are excreted from the brain, [[adrenal]] and [[pituitary glands]] in response to stress on the system. [[Cardiac arrhythmias]] are often the result of an overabundance of these hormones on the system.&lt;ref name="Esther"&gt;[[#Reference-idSternberg2002|Sternberg, Esther. "Walter B. Cannon and 'Voodoo' Death: A Perspective From 60 Years On."]] pp. 1564–1566.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Wylie Vale]], PhD, discovered [[corticotrophin]], the brain's hypothalamic stress hormone, or CRH: this hormone secreted by the [[hypothalamus]] coordinates with "the brain stem adrenaline centers involved in initiation of the sympathetic response ... to cause a massive release of both adrenaline-like nerve chemicals and stress hormones. Together these might well cause illness, including loss of appetite, weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even vascular collapse that could result in death."&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt;

Martin A. Samuels, MD, elaborates further on still another process of death, stating that with the release of adrenaline and an increased heart rate, sometimes [[catecholamines]], stress hormones, will build up, leading to calcium channels opening and remaining open, resulting in an overflow of calcium into the system, killing off cells.&lt;ref name="Samuels"&gt;[[#Reference-idKirn2004|Kirn, Timothy. "Voodoo death is brain's lethal response to fear."]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasympathetic over-activation==
Cannon believed that extreme emotional stress could be explained in terms of degree of sympathetic-adrenal excitation. However, an experiment performed by Curt Richter (1957) responded to Cannon's challenge with an animal model. Richter placed pre-stressed rats in a closed turbulent water. the latency to drowning was recorded. Most domestic lab rats lasted for hours while unexpectedly all of the wild rats died within 15 minutes. Richter monitored heart rate and determined whether the heart was in systole or diastole after death. He found out that heart rate slowed down prior to death and the heart was engaged with blood reflecting a state of diastole. This contradicted Cannons proposal that sympathetic adrenal over-activation is the result of death since a sympathetic over-arousal would increase both heart rate and blood pressure to severe degrees.
Richter interpreted this that the rats died as a result of over-stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, specifically the [[vagus nerve]] which regulates heartbeat. The lethal vagal effect was the psychological state of hopelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richter | first1 = C.P. | year = 1957 | title = On the phenomenon of sudden death in animals and man | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 191–8 | doi=10.1097/00006842-195705000-00004| pmid = 13432092 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.536.1405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden prolonged immobility or faked death is an adaptive response exhibited by many mammalian species. Hofer(1970) demonstrated that several rodent species when threatened exhibited an immobility that was accompanied by a very low heart rate. For some of the rodents that heart rate reached below 50% of the baseline. Hofer distinguished between prolonged immobility and faked death phenomenon. Unlike the behavior of "hopelessness" described by Richter, the death-faking occurred with a sudden motor collapse during active struggling. Hofer interpreted the fear-inducing slowing of heart rate as a vagal phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofer | first1 = M.A. | year = 1970 | title = Cardiac respiratory function during sudden prolonged immobility in wild rodents | url = | journal = Psychosom. Med. | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 633–47 | doi=10.1097/00006842-197011000-00008| pmid = 5530023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These data suggest that vagus contributes to severe emotional states and may be related to emotional states of immobilization, such as extreme terror. Unfortunately, this immobilization technique is potentially life-threatening for mammals (but not for reptiles). Mammals would undergo states of [[bradycardia]] or [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] as an over-activation of parasympathetic vagus system. The organs of the oxygen-hungry mammal are deprived of oxygen due to lack of blood flow, and the animal dies.

==Critical evaluation==
Despite Cannon's general ignorance on the particulars of physiological breakdown, scientists in the intervening years since the publication of Cannon's work, have generally agreed with his fundamental hypotheses concerning voodoo death. Criticisms that generally come against Cannon's work are directed at the hearsay nature of Cannon's case studies, but recent studies have discovered numerous examples of voodoo death in various societies.&lt;ref name="Lester"&gt;[[#Reference-idLester2009|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death."]] pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; To those who allege difficulty in the experimental process of validating Cannon's theory, Barbara W. Lex, in her 1974 article titled, "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation", states that "Voodoo death" can easily be observed without complicated experiments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pupillary constriction, easily observable and indicative of parasympathetic activation ... the amount of saliva, of perspiration, degree of muscle tonicity and skin pallor in an individual are also discernible without complicated instruments."&lt;ref name="Lex"&gt;[[#Reference-idLex2009|Lex, Barbara. "Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation."]] pp. 818–823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are those who contest the theories involving psychologically-induced body failure. David Lester, PhD, in 1972, contends that Cannon's evidence, particularly the evidence concerning animals, is anecdotal and irrelevant, and instead sets forth the concept of "death by suggestion", and supports "giving up-given up" complex set forth by George L. Engel, thus attributing the cause of death entirely to the psychological state of the individual in question rather than a psychological–physiological connection adduced by Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idLester1972|Lester, David. "Voodoo Death: Some New Thoughts on an Old Phenomenon."]] pp. 386–390.&lt;/ref&gt; Going even further, Harry D. Eastwell, MD in his 1982 article, "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia", rejects entirely the concept of "Voodoo death", stating that the deaths in cases reported by Cannon et al. were more likely due to dehydration rather than to any psychological response.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idEastwell1982|Eastwell, Harry D. "Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia."]] pp. 5–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of this theory on modern science==
===Fight or flight===
Deeply related to these cases of sudden death is what Cannon termed the "[[fight-or-flight response]]", what has been classified as a "neurophysiological-behavioral" response pattern. "Fight or flight" is a phrase used to describe the instinctual and physiological responses to strong emotion within animals as well as humans. Cannon associates the two emotions of rage and fear because of the similar effects the emotions will have upon the mind and body—rage will encourage the response to "fight", while fear will encourage "flight". The mind, when faced with one or both of these emotions in response to a perceived threat, will emit adrenaline, and heart rate will increase; however, sometimes the system is overwhelmed by the responses, and collapse ensues as brought about by the workings of stress hormones.&lt;ref name= "Samuels"/&gt;

In the case of voodoo death, the "flight" response overpowers the system, but there is little to no possibility for action in the mind of the individual suffering from the perceived threat—considering the state of aboriginal tribes, the victims believe themselves to be suffering from a curse in which they are condemned to die, and so they believe themselves to be unable to act to save themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGomez1982|Gomez, E.A. "Voodoo and sudden death: the effects of expectations on health."]] pp. 75–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New fields===
Cannon's theory concerning voodoo death opened research into various fields of psychological studies; since the publication of Cannon's work, scientists have discovered many disorders and the like related to psychosomatic responses to situations. Because of Cannon's postulation that the mind could bring about death, scientists have become open to the idea of the mind working on the body in a greater number of ways, leading to the development of [[psychosomatic medicine]].&lt;ref name="names"&gt;[[#Reference-idLane2009|Lane, R.D., Waldstein, S.R., Chesney, M.A, et al. "The Rebirth of Neuroscience in Psychosomatic Medicine, Part I: Historical Context, Methods, and Relevant Basic Science."]] pp. 117–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of theories concerning voodoo death within the scientific field has also led to the development of a branch of psychology termed [[psychophysiology]].&lt;ref name="names"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
Though cases within aboriginal societies are the most commonly cited when researchers such as Cannon set forth examples, similar cases of psychosomatic death have also been reported in other cultures.

In his 1964 article, James L. Mathis, MD, describes a case of a previously healthy man who died from asthmatic attacks when his mother "cursed" him for going against her wishes. Mathis proposes that "fatal psychosomatic conditions" were the cause of this man's death, and thus a form of voodoo death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMathis1964|Mathis, James L. "Sophisticated Version of Voodoo Death."]] pp. 104–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist—Clifton K. Meador, MD—in 1992 discussed the case of a man diagnosed with cancer who, along with his physicians and family, believed he was dying of cancer. In the autopsy after his death, however, the doctors discovered that his cancer was not at all the cause of his death. Meador deduces that the man's belief in his imminent death was the cause of his death itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1546347 | volume=85 | issue=3 | title=Hex death: voodoo magic or persuasion? | journal=South Med J | pages=244–7 | last1 = Meador | first1 = CK | doi=10.1097/00007611-199203000-00004| year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whangdoodle''' is a [[legendary creature|fanciful creature]] in [[folklore]] and [[children's literature]], most notably used by British authors [[Roald Dahl]] and [[Julie Andrews]]. Popularized by a sermon parody attributed to William P. Brannan as "Where the lion roareth and the whangdoodle mourneth for her first-born," published in ''The Harp of a Thousand Strings: Or, Laughter for a Lifetime'' (1858).
Whangdoodle is also an earlier term for a "fanciful formation" or a "gadget . . . thing for which the correct name is not known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=whangdoodle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roald Dahl books==

=== ''The Minpins'' ===
In [[Roald Dahl]]'s book ''[[The Minpins]]'', one of the main characters is warned by his mother against a forest where Whangdoodles live.

=== ''James and the Giant Peach'' ===
One of the firemen of the [[James and the Giant Peach|book]] refers to the [[centipede]] as a Whangdoodle.

=== ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' ===
In ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', [[Willy Wonka]] mentions that he saved the Oompa Loompas from Whangdoodles and various other monsters.

==The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles==
{{main article|The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles}}
A different Whangdoodle is described in the children's novel ''The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles'' by singer and actress Dame [[Julie Andrews]] (under her married name of Julie Edwards): an intelligent, ungulate-like character capable of changing color to suit its emotions, from whose hind legs grow a new and different set of bedroom slippers each year. It is introduced to the [[protagonist]]s Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist 'Professor Savant', a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain. Attempting to visit both, the scientist and children are opposed by the [[antagonist]] 'Prock' (the Whangdoodle's second-in-command), until his resources are exhausted by their tenacity. With Prock persuaded to grant their passage, the children discover that the Whangdoodle is oppressed by want of a mate, and convince Savant to create the latter. With this done, the two Whangdoodles are wedded at a great celebration, and the children return to their home.

== The Big Rock Candy Mountain ==
Some versions of the song "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain|The Big Rock Candy Mountain]]" include a mention of a Whangdoodle singing in the titular [[hobo]]'s paradise. This is the case in the version written down and arranged by Charles and Ruth Seeger. This version is used in the Frederic Rzewski composition for violin, piano, and percussion, entitled 'Whangdoodles'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4324">In [[physics]], '''zilch''' is a [[conserved quantity]] of the [[electromagnetic field]].

Daniel M. Lipkin observed that if he defined the quantities 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z^0 &amp; = \mathbf{E}\cdot \nabla \times\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla \times\mathbf{B} \\[4pt]
\mathbf{Z} &amp; = \frac{1}{c}\left ( \mathbf{E}\times\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{B} \times\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{B} \right )
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then the [[Maxwell equations]] imply that

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_0 Z^0 + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{Z} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which implies that the total "zilch" &lt;math&gt;\int Z^0 \, d^3x&lt;/math&gt; is constant (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the "zilch current"). Generalising the result, Lipkin found nine related conservation laws, all unrelated to the [[stress-energy tensor]]. He named the quantity zilch because of the apparent lack of physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Zilch can also be expressed using the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] [[electromagnetic tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{F}^{\mu\nu}=(1/2)\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F_{\rho\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; as
&lt;math&gt;Z^\mu_\nu\rho =  \hat{F}^{\mu\lambda}F_{\lambda\nu,\rho} - F^{\mu\lambda} \hat{F}_{\lambda\nu,\rho} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=kibble/&gt;

It was later demonstrated that zilch is part of an infinite number of zilch-like conserved quantities, a general property of free [[Field_(physics)|fields]].&lt;ref name=kibble&gt;{{cite journal

Zilch has occasionally been rediscovered. It has been called "optical chirality", since it determines the degree of chiral asymmetry in the rate of excitation of a small chiral molecule by an incident electromagnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
