      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">An '''absentee business owner''' is one who does not personally manage the business but owns it or does not live in the community in which the business operates. Studies show that money spent locally circulates back into the community three times as much when it is not spent with an absentee-owned business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starherald.com/articles/2010/01/30/news/local_news/doc4b626d45e3a47145488804.txt&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local currency]] has been implemented in some communities as a countermeasure to this effect. Neighborhood investment, in which members of the community are given opportunities to become partial owners of new developments, is another method.&lt;ref&gt;http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060409/news_mz1b9neighbo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''Asset Recovery Software''' is a business term that refers to a set of software tools or modules used in executing [[asset recovery]] transactions, managing buyer relationships, and controlling associated business processes.  The key purpose of these tools is to help companies effectively identify, reuse, and divest idle assets.

Although the functionality included in these systems can vary, it commonly includes one or more of the following:

# Idle asset identification
# Internal asset redeployment
# Divestment management
# Idle asset tracking
# User management
# Order management 
# Asset promotion

==Web Accessibility==
Asset recovery software can include anything ranging from a small [[desktop application]] to an application that resides on a [[Server (computing)|server]] that can be accessed by many people across diverse geographic locations. The current trend in larger asset recovery departments is toward increased [[collaboration]] and [[web applications]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Wheaton (2008) [http://www.epiqtech.com/investment-recovery-software.htm Investment Recovery Software] online at Epiqtech.com (accessed on October 7, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=August 2010}}{{Self-published inline|date=August 2010}}
The introduction of [[cloud technology]] and the rise [[Software as a service|Software-as-a-service]] model led to many new offerings focusing on different aspects of asset recovery. Firms can choose between solutions focusing on internal asset redeployment (e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120110142116/http://www.assetglobe.com/enterprise-saas AssetGlobe]) or alternatives developed by online auction, asset trading and recycling providers.

==Potential Benefits==
Organizations that adopt asset recovery software generally expect to realize several benefits.  These can be monetary or process improvement benefits.  Some of these benefits include:

# Process standardization
# Higher asset sale prices
# Increased collaboration
# More redeployments
# Better identification of idle assets
# Effective buyer management
# Better audit preparation
# Transparent divestment process
# Increased visibility

[[Image:Warpedtourpass.jpg|thumb|203px|Warped Tour 2006 All Access Pass]]
A '''backstage pass''' is an employee pass which allows its bearer access to employees-only areas at a performance venue. They are most commonly associated with [[rock music]] groups.

Such passes are usually a laminated paper worn on a lanyard, or on chain link or key chain holder at the belt, or a simpler "stick-on" applied to one's clothing. Plastic or paper wristbands may also be used.  However, some elaborately designed backstage passes have been used by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] Productions/Winterland, Beaver Productions and many other regional and local promoters.  To deter counterfeiting, passes often include holograms or color-shifting properties.

At any one concert or event there are about 200 to 400 backstage passes available. Again, mainly these are for the performers, stage crews, roadies, security guards,
performer's agents. Sometimes relatives or close friends of performers, stage crew, promoters, etc. 
will get backstage passes to concerts. 

Some venues (including the [[House of Blues]] venues and Irving Plaza in New York) require their own passes to be worn, even by laminate holders for the tour.  Large music festivals, such as [[Ozzfest]] and the [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] also usually issue their own passes.

Backstage passes sometimes become [[memorabilia]] sold to die-hard fans, especially when the pass is signed by a performer.

In media, the term "Backstage Pass" may be used to signify the presence of expanded coverage of certain musical groups.

==Types of passes==
There are a number of different types of backstage passes:

*All Access passes allow the bearer unlimited access to the performance venue. Such passes are generally restricted to the performers, their crew and management, and management of the venue.
*Stage Crew passes are used by those who set up the stage. If used by local, temporary help, such passes are usually valid only during this part of day, and not for during or after the show.
*Other employee passes for people who work specific jobs in support of the act, such as catering, security, and merchandising personnel.
*Passes for media, such as press reporters and photographers.
*Limited Access passes are usually intended for specially selected fans that get to "meet and greet" the performers, and can also be used for guests of the band in order to give them VIP status. Sometimes these passes will actually have VIP printed on them. These passes are often issued for afterparties.
*Backstage passes are also given out by the band and band's manager to selected fans who want to hang out with the band. These passes are commonly associated with [[groupies]], and are frequently issued for afterparties.

Otto Printing (in Kentucky) and PERRi Entertainment (in Reno, NV) helped establish the industry and were two of the largest manufactures and designers of passes up until 2003. When PERRi folded, the current leading printer of backstage passes emerged: [http://www.accesseventsolutions.com ACCESS Event Solutions.] Reno has become the largest source for backstage pass printing. Otto is still printing passes and is the oldest printer of backstage passes.  While currently Reno and Otto Printing produce the largest amount of back stage passes, there are many companies looking to surpass them in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idcreator.com/back-stage-passes|date=June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some ways to get backstage passes. One way is to get employed for the venue. 
Some backstage passes are given as prizes by official fan clubs. Sometimes local radio stations and/or local music shops will obtain one or a few from the concert promoters or their agents and will give away as a type of promotional prize.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46134">{{Strategy}}

The '''balanced scorecard'''  is a strategy [[performance management]] tool – a semi-standard structured [[report]], that can be used by managers to keep track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey&gt;{{cite web|title=2GC Balanced Scorecard Usage Survey|url=https://2gc.eu/survey|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase 'balanced scorecard' primarily refers to a performance management report used by a management team, and typically this team is focused on managing the implementation of a strategy or operational activities - in a recent survey&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt; 62% of respondents reported using Balanced Scorecard for strategy implementation management, 48% for operational management.  Balanced Scorecard is also used by individuals to track personal performance, but this is less common - only 17% of respondents in the survey using Balanced Scorecard in this way, however it is clear from the same survey that a larger proportion (about 30%) use corporate Balanced Scorecard elements to inform personal goal setting and incentive calculations.

The critical characteristics that define a balanced scorecard are:&lt;ref name=What_is_BSC_FAQ&gt;{{citation|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/faqs/what-is-a-balanced-scorecard|title=FAQ Answer: What is the Balanced Scorecard?|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620093448/http://2gc.eu/files/2GC-FAQ1-What_is_a_Balanced_Scorecard_140616.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the selection of a small number of data items to monitor

Balanced scorecard is an example of a [[closed-loop controller]] or cybernetic control applied to the management of the [[strategic control|implementation of a strategy]].&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muralidharan|first=Raman|title=A framework for designing strategy content controls|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=590–601|doi=10.1108/17410400410561213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Closed-loop or cybernetic control is where actual performance is measured, the measured value is compared to a reference value and based on the difference between the two corrective interventions are made as required.  Such control requires three things to be effective:
* a choice of data to measure,
* the setting of a reference value for the data,
* the ability to make a corrective intervention.&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004 /&gt;

Within the strategy management context, all three of these characteristic closed-loop control elements need to be derived from the organisation's strategy and also need to reflect the ability of the observer to both monitor performance and subsequently intervene – both of which may be constrained.&lt;ref name=Ouchi_1977&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouchi|first=W.

Two of the ideas that underpin modern balanced scorecard designs concern making it easier to select which data to observe, and ensuring that the choice of data is consistent with the ability of the observer to intervene.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrie|first=Gavin J G|author2=Cobbold, I |title=3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard: Evolution of an effective strategic control tool|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=611–623|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/evolution-of-the-3rd-generation-balanced-scorecard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501201157/http://2gc.eu/files/resources/2GC-WP-Dev3rdGenBSC-090311.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014|accessdate=11 July 2017|doi=10.1108/17410400410561231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Organizations have used systems consisting of a mix of financial and non-financial measures to track progress for quite some time.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Marc|author2=Manzoni, J |title=The balanced scorecard and tableau de bord: Translating strategy into action|journal=Management Accounting|year=1997|volume=79|issue=2|pages=28–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such system was created by Art Schneiderman in 1987 at [[Analog Devices]], a mid-sized semi-conductor company; the Analog Devices Balanced Scorecard.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman/&gt;  Schneiderman's design was similar to what is now recognised as a "First Generation" Balanced Scorecard design.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

In 1990 Art Schneiderman participated in an unrelated research study led by [[Robert S. Kaplan]] in conjunction with US management consultancy Nolan-Norton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nolannorton.com/|title=nolannorton.com|author=|date=|website=www.nolannorton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during this study described his work on performance measurement.&lt;ref name=Schneiderman/&gt;  Subsequently, Kaplan and [[David P. Norton]] included anonymous details of this balanced scorecard design in a 1992 article.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; Kaplan and Norton's article wasn't the only paper on the topic published in early 1992&lt;ref name=Maisel_1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maisel|first=L. S.|title=Performance measurement: the Balanced Scorecard approach|journal=Journal of Cost Management|year=1992|volume=6|issue=2|pages=47–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 1992 Kaplan and Norton paper was a popular success, and was quickly followed by a second in 1993.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S|author2=Norton, D. P. |title=Putting the Balanced Scorecard to Work|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the two authors published a book ''The Balanced Scorecard''.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S|title=The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action|year=1996|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-0-87584-651-4|author2=Norton, D. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These articles and the first book spread knowledge of the concept of balanced scorecard widely, and has led to Kaplan and Norton being seen as the creators of the concept.

While the "corporate scorecard" terminology was coined by Art Schneiderman, the roots of performance management as an activity run deep in management literature and practice.  Management historians such as [[Alfred D. Chandler Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] suggest the origins of performance management can be seen in the emergence of the complex organisation – most notably during the 19th Century in the USA.&lt;ref name=Chandler_1962&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Alfred D.|title=Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Enterprise|year=1962|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-1-61427-508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent influences may include the pioneering work of General Electric on performance measurement reporting in the 1950s and the work of French process engineers (who created the ''tableau de bord'' – literally, a "dashboard" of performance measures) in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;  The tool also draws strongly on the ideas of the 'resource based view of the firm'&lt;ref name=Penrose_1959&gt;{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Edith|title=The Theory of the Growth of the Firm|year=1959|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-828977-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Edith Penrose]].  However it should be noted that none of these influences is explicitly linked to original descriptions of balanced scorecard by Schneiderman, Maisel, or Kaplan &amp; Norton.

Kaplan and Norton's first book&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_1996 /&gt; remains their most popular. The book reflects the earliest incarnations of balanced scorecards – effectively restating the concept as described in the second Harvard Business Review article.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt;  Their second book, ''The Strategy Focused Organization'',&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|title=The Strategy-Focused Organization: How Balanced Scorecard Companies Thrive in the New Business Environment|date=1 October 2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-57851-250-8|author2=Norton, D. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoed work by others (particularly a book published the year before by Olve et al. in Scandinavia&lt;ref name=Olve_1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Olve|first=Nils-Göran|title=Performance Drivers: A practical guide to using the Balanced Scorecard|date=25 Feb 1999|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-98623-2|author2=Roy, J. |author3=Wetter, M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) on the value of visually documenting the links between measures by proposing the "Strategic Linkage Model" or [[strategy map]].

As the title of Kaplan and Norton's second book&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2000 /&gt; highlights, even by 2000 the focus of attention among thought-leaders was moving from the design of Balanced Scorecards themselves, towards the use of Balanced Scorecard as a focal point within a more comprehensive strategic management system.  Subsequent writing on Balanced Scorecard by Kaplan &amp; Norton has focused on uses of Balanced Scorecard rather than its design (e.g. "The Execution Premium" in 2008&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|title=The Execution Premium: Linking Strategy to Operations|date=1 July 2008|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-1-4221-2116-0|author2=Norton, D. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;), however many others have continued to refine the device itself (e.g. Abernethy et al.&lt;ref name=abernethy_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abernethy|first=Margret A|last2=Horne |first2=M. |last3=Lillis |first3=A.M. |last4=Malina |first4=M.A. |last5=Selto |first5=F.H.|title=A multi-method approach to building causal performance maps from expert knowledge|journal=Management accounting research|year=2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=135–155|doi=10.1016/j.mar.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Characteristics ==
The characteristics of the balanced scorecard and its derivatives is the presentation of a mixture of financial and non-financial measures each compared to a 'target' value within a single concise report.  The report is not meant to be a replacement for traditional financial or operational reports but a succinct summary that captures the information most relevant to those reading it.  It is the method by which this 'most relevant' information is determined (i.e., the design processes used to select the content) that most differentiates the various versions of the tool in circulation. The balanced scorecard indirectly also provides a useful insight into an organisation's strategy – by requiring general strategic statements (e.g. mission, vision) to be precipitated into more specific/tangible forms.&lt;ref name=Shulver_Antarkar_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulver|first=Michael J|author2=Antarkar, N |title=The Balanced Scorecard as a Communication Protocol for Managing Across Intra-Organizational Borders|journal=Proceedings from the 12th Annual Conference of the Production and Operations Management Society, Orlando, Florida, USA.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first versions of balanced scorecard asserted that relevance should derive from the [[corporate strategy]], and proposed design methods that focused on choosing measures and targets associated with the main activities required to implement the strategy.  As the initial audience for this were the readers of the [[Harvard Business Review]], the proposal was translated into a form that made sense to a typical reader of that journal – managers of US commercial businesses.  Accordingly, initial designs were encouraged to measure three categories of non-financial measure in addition to financial outputs – those of "customer," "internal business processes" and "learning and growth."  These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Max|title=Improving and evaluating performance with the Public Sector Scorecard|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|year=2017|volume=66|issue=4|pages=442–458|doi=10.1108/IJPPM-06-2015-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt; or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=Butler_1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butler|first=A.|author2=Letza S. R. |author3=Neale B. |title=Linking the Balanced Scorecard to Strategy|journal=Long Range Planning|year=1997|volume=30|issue=2|pages=242–253|doi=10.1016/s0024-6301(96)00116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn (2001),&lt;ref name=Ahn_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=H|title=Applying the Balanced Scorecard Concept: An Experience Report|journal=Long Range Planning|year=2001|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–461|doi=10.1016/s0024-6301(01)00057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elefalke (2001),&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elefalke|first=K|title=The Balanced Scorecard of the Swedish Police Service: 7000 officers in total quality management project|journal=Total Quality Management|year=2001|volume=12|issue=7|pages=958–966|doi=10.1080/09544120120096106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brignall (2002),&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brignal|first=S.|title=The UnBalanced Scorecard: a Social and Environmental Critique|journal=Proceedings, Third International Conference on Performance Measurement and Management (PMA2002)|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irwin (2002),&lt;ref name=Irwin_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=D|title=Strategy Mapping in the Public Sector|journal=International Journal of Strategic Management|year=2002|volume=35|issue=6|pages=563–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radnor et al.

Modern balanced scorecards have evolved since the initial ideas proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the modern performance management tools including Balanced Scorecard are significantly improved – being more flexible (to suit a wider range of organisational types) and more effective (as design methods have evolved to make them easier to design, and use).&lt;ref name=Malina_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malina|first=M. A.|author2=Selto, F. H. |title=Communicating and Controlling Strategy: An Empirical Study of the Effectiveness of the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|year=2001|volume=13|pages=47–90|doi=10.2308/jmar.2001.13.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.&lt;ref name=Muralidharan_2004 /&gt;

The original thinking behind a balanced scorecard was for it to be focused on information relating to the implementation of a strategy, and over time there has been a blurring of the boundaries between conventional strategic planning and control activities and those required to design a balanced scorecard. This is illustrated well by the four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan &amp; Norton's writing on the subject in the late 1990s:

# Translating the vision into operational goals;
# Communicating the vision and link it to individual performance;
# Business planning; index setting
# Feedback and learning, and adjusting the strategy accordingly.

These steps go far beyond the simple task of identifying a small number of financial and non-financial measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.

Although it helps focus managers' attention on strategic issues and the management of the implementation of strategy, it is important to remember that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt; In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with [[strategic planning]] systems and other tools.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;

=== First Generation ===

The first generation of balanced scorecard designs used a "four perspective" approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy. `The original four "perspectives" proposed&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; were:
* '''Financial''': encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures.  In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question "How do we look to shareholders?" Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity.&lt;ref name=simons_1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Robert L.|title=Levers of Control: How Managers Use Innovative Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal: How Managers Use Control Systems to Drive Strategic Renewal|date=1 December 1994|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, MA.|isbn=978-0-87584-559-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Customer''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What is important to our customers and stakeholders?" Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customers’ purchases, ranking by important customers.
* '''Internal business processes''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What must we excel at?"Examples: cycle time, unit cost, yield, new product introductions.
* '''Learning and growth''': encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "How can we continue to improve, create value and [[innovation|innovate]]?". Examples: time to develop new generation of products, life cycle to product maturity, time to market versus competition.

The idea was that managers used these perspective headings to prompt the selection of a small number of measures that informed on that aspect of the organisation's strategic performance.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;  The perspective headings show that Kaplan and Norton were thinking about the needs of non-divisional commercial organisations in their initial design.  These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations,&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=Butler_1997 /&gt; Ahn (2001),&lt;ref name=Ahn_2001 /&gt; Elefalke (2001),&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001 /&gt; Brignall (2002),&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; Irwin (2002),&lt;ref name=Irwin_2002 /&gt;, Flamholtz (2003)&lt;ref name=Flamholtz_2003 /&gt;, Radnor et al. (2003)&lt;ref name=Radnor_2003 /&gt;).

These suggestions were notably triggered by a recognition that different but equivalent headings would yield alternative sets of measures, and this represents the major design challenge faced with this type of balanced scorecard design: justifying the choice of measures made. "Of all the measures you could have chosen, why did you choose these?"  These issues contribute to dis-satisfaction with early Balanced Scorecard designs, since if users are not confident that the measures within the Balanced Scorecard are well chosen, they will have less confidence in the information it provides.&lt;ref name=Kellermans_2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellermans|first=Walter J.|author2=Floyd F. W. |author3=Veiga S. W. |author4=Matherne C. |title=Strategic Alignment: A missing link in the relationship between strategic consensus and organisational performance|journal=Strategic Organization|year=2013|volume=11|issue=3|pages=304–328 |doi=10.1177/1476127013481155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although less common, these early-style balanced scorecards are still designed and used today.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

In short, first generation balanced scorecards are hard to design in a way that builds confidence that they are well designed. Because of this, many are abandoned soon after completion.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;

=== Second generation ===

In the mid-1990s, an improved design method emerged.&lt;ref name=Olve_1999 /&gt; In the new method, measures are selected based on a set of "strategic objectives" plotted on a "strategic linkage model" or "[[strategy map]]". With this modified approach, the strategic objectives are distributed across the four measurement perspectives, so as to "connect the dots" to form a visual presentation of strategy and measures.&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_CMR_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Robert S.|author2=Norton D. P. |title=Linking the Balanced Scorecard to Strategy|journal=California Management Review|year=1996|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53–79|doi=10.2307/41165876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this modified version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives within each of the perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a "strategic linkage model".  A balanced scorecard of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;   This type of approach provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through.  This style of balanced scorecard has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so can be thought of as representing the "2nd generation" of design approach adopted for the balanced scorecard since its introduction.

=== Third generation ===
{{Main|Third-generation balanced scorecard}}
In the late 1990s, the design approach had evolved yet again. One problem with the "second generation" design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene, to influence strategic goals are, and need to be, anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to "roll forward" and test the impact of these goals necessitated the creation of an additional design instrument: the Vision or Destination Statement. This device was a statement of what "strategic success", or the "strategic end-state", looked like. It was quickly realized that if a Destination Statement was created at the beginning of the design process, then it was easier to select strategic activity and outcome objectives to respond to it. Measures and targets could then be selected to track the achievement of these objectives. Design methods that incorporate a Destination Statement or equivalent (e.g. the [[results-based management]] method proposed by the UN in 2002) represent a tangibly different design approach to those that went before, and have been proposed as representing a "third generation" design method for balanced scorecards.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

Design methods for balanced scorecards continue to evolve and adapt to reflect the deficiencies in the currently used methods, and the particular needs of communities of interest (e.g. NGO's and government departments have found the third generation methods embedded in results-based management more useful than first or second generation design methods).&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawrie|first=Gavin J. G.|author2=Kalff D. |author3=Andersen H. |title=Balanced Scorecard and Results- Based Management – Convergent Performance Management Systems|journal=Proceedings of 3rd Annual Conference on Performance Measurement and Management Control, the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management (EIASM), Nice, France|year=2005|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/balanced-scorecard-and-results-based-management-convergent-performance-mana|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation refined the second generation of balanced scorecards to give more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

== Popularity ==
In 1997, Kurtzman&lt;ref name=Kurtzman_1997&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtzman|first=Joel|title=Is your company off course?  Now you can find out why.|newspaper=Fortune|date=17 February 1997|pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 64 percent of the companies questioned were measuring performance from a number of perspectives in a similar way to the balanced scorecard. Balanced scorecards have been implemented by government agencies, military units, business units and corporations as a whole, non-profit organizations, and schools.

Balanced scorecard has been widely adopted, and consistently has been found to be the most popular performance management framework in a widely respected annual survey (e.g. see results from 2003&lt;ref name=Rigby_2003&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby|first=D.|title=Bain and Company's Management Tools and Trends Survey 2003|url=http://www.unstoppablegrowth.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/Public/12065.pdf|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=11 July 2017|author2=Bilodeau B. |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013&lt;ref name=Rigby_2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigby|first=D.|title=Bain and Company's Management Tools and Trends Survey 2013|url=http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2013.aspx|publisher=Bain &amp; Company|accessdate=28 May 2014|author2=Bilodeau B. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407005331/http://bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-and-trends-2013.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Theorists have argued from the earliest days of discussion of Balanced Scorecard usage that much of the benefit of the balanced scorecard comes from the design process itself.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneiderman|first=Arthur M.|title=Why Balanced Scorecards fail|journal=Journal of Strategic Performance Measurement|year=1999|issue=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it is argued that many failures in the early days of balanced scorecard could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt; - it is suggested that by not being involved in the design, the relevant managers who were to use the device did not trust, and so failed to engage with and use the devices.&lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;

== Variants ==
Since the balanced scorecard was popularized in the early 1990s, a large number of alternatives to the original 'four box' balanced scorecard promoted by Kaplan and Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt; in their various articles and books have emerged.  Most have very limited application, and are typically proposed either by academics as vehicles for expanding the dialogue beyond the financial bottom line – e.g. Brignall (2002)&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; or consultants as an attempt at differentiation to promote sales of books and / or consultancy (e.g. Neely et al. (2002),&lt;ref name=Prism_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Neely|first=Andy|title=The Performance Prism: The Scorecard for Measuring and Managing Business Success: The Scorecard for Measuring and Managing Stakeholder Relationships|date=27 May 2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=London|isbn=978-0-273-65334-9|author2=Adams C. |author3=Kennerley M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne (2002),&lt;ref name=Bourne_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourne|first=Mike|title=Balanced Scorecard in a Week|date=29 November 2002|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London|isbn=978-0-340-84945-3|author2=Bourne P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven (2002)&lt;ref name=Niven_2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Niven|first=Paul R.|title=Balanced Scorecard Step-by-step: Maximizing Performance and Maintaining Results|date=18 April 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-07872-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many of the structural variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt; attempted to identify a pattern in these variations – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared to be part of an evolution of the balanced scorecard concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as "generations".  Broadly, the original 'measures in four boxes' type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;) constitutes the 1st generation balanced scorecard design; balanced scorecard designs that include a 'strategy map' or 'strategic linkage model' (e.g. the Performance Prism,&lt;ref name=Prism_2002 /&gt; later Kaplan &amp; Norton designs&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_Book_2008 /&gt; the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy &amp; Wetter (English translation 1999,&lt;ref name=Olve_1999 /&gt; 1st published in Swedish 1997)) constitute the 2nd Generation of Balanced Scorecard design; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a separate document describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the "destination statement" idea) comprise the 3rd generation balanced scorecard design.

Variants that feature adaptations of the structure of balanced scorecard to suit better a particular viewpoint or agenda are numerous. Examples of the focus of such adaptations include the triple bottom line,&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt; decision support,&lt;ref name=Ioppolo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioppolo|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Saija|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Salomone|first3=Roberta|title=Developing a Territory Balanced Scorecard approach to manage projects for local development: Two case studies|journal=Land Use Policy|date=July 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=629–640|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837711001190|accessdate=30 June 2014|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; public sector management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Northcott|first1=Deryl|last2=Taulapapa|first2=Tuivaiti Ma'amora|title=sing the balanced scorecard to manage performance in public sector organizations|journal=The International Journal of Public Sector Management|date=2012|volume=25|issue=3|pages=166–191|doi=10.1108/09513551211224234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and health care management.&lt;ref name=Moullin_PSS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moullin|first1=Max|last2=Soady|first2=John|last3=Skinner|first3=John|last4=Price|first4=Charles|last5=Cullen|first5=John|last6=Gilligan|first6=Christine|title=Using the Public Sector Scorecard in Public Health|journal=Journal of Health Care Quality Assurance|date=2007|volume=20|issue=4|pages=281–289|doi=10.1108/09526860710754352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance management elements of the UN's [[Results Based Management]] system have strong design and structural similarities to those used in the 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard design approach.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005 /&gt;

Balanced scorecard is also linked to [[quality management]] tools and activities.&lt;ref name="gardiner_2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardiner|first1=P. D.|last2=Simmons|first2=J. E. L.|title=Performance measurement tools: The balanced scorecard and the EFQM excellence model|journal=Measuring Business Excellence|date=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=14–29|doi=10.1108/13683040310466690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are clear areas of cross-over and association, the two sets of tools are complementary rather than duplicative.&lt;ref name=andersen_lawrie_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Henrik V.|last2=Lawrie|first2=Gavin|last3=Savič|first3=Nenad|title=Effective quality management through third-generation balanced scorecard|journal=International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management|date=2004|volume=53|issue=7|pages=634–645|doi=10.1108/17410400410561259|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235283963_Effective_quality_management_through_third-generation_balanced_scorecard|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced scorecard is also used to support the payments of incentives to individuals,&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt; even though it was not designed for this purpose and is not particularly suited to it.&lt;ref name=What_is_BSC_FAQ /&gt;&lt;ref name=2GC_IPM_2003&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I link corporate and individual performance management systems?|url=https://2gc.eu/resources/research/designing-incentive-systems-linking-people-performance-and-reward|publisher=2GC Active Management|accessdate=11 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528144138/http://2gc.eu/files/resources/2GC-WP-LCIPMS-090311.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Academic criticism of the balanced scorecard can be broken into three distinct (but overlapping) areas of concern.

# The first kind of criticism focuses on the empirical nature of the framework, and when it was originally proposed the lack of any formal validation of the ideas. Kaplan and Norton notoriously failed to include any citations of earlier articles in their initial papers on the topic&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt;, an absence noted, for example, by Norreklit&lt;ref name=Norreklit_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norreklit|first=Hanne|title=The balance on the balanced scorecard – a critical analysis of some of its assumptions|journal=Management Accounting Research|year=2000|volume=11|issue=1|pages=65–88|doi=10.1006/mare.1999.0121}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Others identified technical flaws in the methods and design of the original balanced scorecard &lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lingle_1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lingle|first=J. H.|author2=Schiemann W. A. |title=From balanced scorecard to strategic gauges: Is measurement worth it?|journal=Management Review|year=1996|volume=85|issue=3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; or concerning the lack of validation for the approach - for example Flamholtz observed that no validation was provided for the choice of the "four perspectives" of the 1st Generation design&lt;ref name=Flamholtz_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flamholtz|first=Erik|title=Putting Balance and Validity into the Balanced Scorecard|journal=Journal of Human Resource Costing and Accounting|year=2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=15-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
# The second kind of criticism is that the balanced scorecard does not provide a bottom line score or a unified view with clear recommendations: it is simply a list of metrics (e.g. Jensen 2001&lt;ref name=Jensen_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=M. C.|title=Value maximisation, stakeholder theory, and the corporate objective function|journal=European Financial Management|year=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=297–318|doi=10.1111/1468-036x.00158}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  These critics usually include in their criticism suggestions about how the 'unanswered' question postulated could be answered, but typically the unanswered question relate to things outside the scope of balanced scorecard itself (such as developing strategies) (e.g. Brignall&lt;ref name=Brignall_2002 /&gt;)
# The third kind of criticism is that the model fails to fully reflect the needs of stakeholders – putting bias on financial stakeholders over others.  Early forms of Balanced Scorecard proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan_Norton_1993 /&gt; focused on the needs of commercial organisations in the USA – where this focus on investment return was appropriate.  This focus was maintained through subsequent revisions.&lt;ref name=Adams_2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=C.|title=Performance measurement frameworks: a review|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK.|author2=Neely A. |author3=Kennerley M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now over 20 years after they were first proposed, the four most common perspectives in Balanced Scorecard designs mirror the four proposed in the original Kaplan &amp; Norton paper.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;  However, as noted earlier in this article, there have been many studies that suggest other perspectives might better reflect the priorities of organisations – particularly but not exclusively relating to the needs of organisations in the public and Non Governmental sectors.&lt;ref name=Andersen_Lawrie_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=Henrik V.|last2=Lawrie|first2=Gavin|title=Examining Opportunities for Improving Public Sector Governance Through Better Strategic Management|journal=Proceedings, Third International Conference on Performance Measurement and Management (PMA 2002),|date=2002|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237340660_Examining_Opportunities_for_Improving_Public_Sector_Governance_Through_Better_Strategic_Management|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the balanced scorecard does not address important aspects of nonprofit strategy such as social dimensions, human resource elements, political issues and the distinctive nature of competition and collaboration in nonprofit settings.&lt;ref name=Kong_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=E.|title=Analysing BSC and IC's usefulness in non-profit organisations.|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|date=2010|volume=11|issue=3|pages=284–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; More modern design approaches such as [[third generation balanced scorecard|3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard]], the Public Sector Scorecard&lt;ref name=Moulin_PSS /&gt; and the UN's [[Results Based Management]] methods explicitly consider the interests of wider stakeholder groups, and perhaps address this issue in its entirety.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Kalff_Andersen_2005 /&gt;

In response to these concerns there have been many studies seeking to provide (retrospective) academic underpinnings for the Balanced Scorecard concept&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Cobbold_2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schneiderman_1999 /&gt;, and to provide case study and validation information for the various design generations&lt;ref name=Elefalke_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Radnor_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrie_et_al_2016 /&gt;.  There are relatively few reliable assessments of the effectiveness of the approaches embodied in Balanced Scorecard, but some studies demonstrate a link between the use of balanced scorecards and better decision making or improved financial performance of companies&lt;ref name=Ittner_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ittner|first1=C.D.|last2=Larcker|first2=D.F.|last3=Randall|first3=T.|title=Performance implications of strategic performance measurement in financial services firms|journal=Accounting Organizations and Society|date=2003|volume=28|issue=7|pages=715–741}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Broadcast surveys of usage have difficulties in this respect, due to the wide variations in definition of 'what a balanced scorecard is' noted above (making it hard to work out in a survey if you are comparing like with like).&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;  Single organization case studies suffer from the 'lack of a control' issue common to any study of organizational change – what the organization would have achieved if the change had not been made isn't known, so it is difficult to attribute changes observed over time to a single intervention (such as introducing a balanced scorecard).  However, such studies as have been done have typically found balanced scorecard to be useful.&lt;ref name=Epstein_Manzoni_1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Malina_2001 /&gt;

Consideration has been given to the effect of organisation size on Balanced Scorecard effectiveness:  
* For large organisations this work has focused on how to translate aggregate corporate strategies into performance management tools relevant to individual teams / units within the organisation.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_et_al_2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrie|first1=Gavin V.|last2=Abdullah|first2=N.A.|last3=Bragg|first3=Christopher|last4=Varlet|first4=Guillaume|title=Multi-level strategic alignment within a complex organisation|journal=Journal of Modelling in Management|date=2016|volume=11|issue=4|pages=889–910|doi=10.1108/JM2-11-2014-0085|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309818479_Multi-level_strategic_alignment_within_a_complex_organisation|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In SMEs Balanced Scorecard has been found to be effective, but it has been noted that focus is required on balancing design complexity and relevance with the availability of resource to do the design work.&lt;ref name=Lawrie_Andersen_2006&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Andersen|first2=Henrik V.|last1=Lawrie|first1=Gavin|title=Balanced Scorecard implementation in SMEs: reflection in literature and practice|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth SMESME Conference|date=2006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252637217_Balanced_Scorecard_implementation_in_SMEs_reflection_in_literature_and_practice|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have argued that the Balanced Scorecard is unsuitable for SMEs for a variety of reasons, including the belief that SMEs lack a long-term strategic focus (Hvolby and Thorstenson (2000), McAdam (2000)), that changes in an SME’s strategy are too frequent,&lt;ref name=rompho_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rompho|first1=N.|title=Why the Balanced Scorecard Fails in SMEs: A Case Study.|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|date=2011|volume=6|issue=11|pages=39–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that SMEs have limited knowledge about performance measurement in general (Rantanen and Holtari 2000) and therefore do not recognise the benefits that might accrue from use of the tool (McAdam 2000; Bourne 2001), but it is also important to note that none of these studies attempts to theorise the reasons behind their negative findings.

== Software tools ==

It is important to recognize that the balanced scorecard by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and non-financial topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).&lt;ref name=Adams_2007 /&gt;

The processes of collecting, reporting, and distributing balanced scorecard information can be labor-intensive and prone to procedural problems (for example, getting all relevant people to return the information required by the required date).  The simplest mechanism to use is to delegate these activities to an individual, and many Balanced Scorecards are reported via ad-hoc methods based around email, phone calls and office software.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

In more complex organizations, where there are multiple balanced scorecards to report and/or a need for co-ordination of results between balanced scorecards (for example, if one level of reports relies on information collected and reported at a lower level) the use of individual reporters is problematic.  Where these conditions apply, organizations use balanced scorecard reporting software to automate the production and distribution of these reports.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;

Recent surveys have consistently found that roughly one third of organizations use generic office software to report their balanced scorecard, one third used software developed specifically for their own use, and one third used one of the many commercial packages available.&lt;ref name=2GC_Survey /&gt;&lt;ref name=intrafocus_surveys&gt;{{cite web|title=Balanced Scorecard Surveys (2012–2016)|url=https://www.intrafocus.com/services/balanced-scorecard-survey|publisher=Intrafocus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blanket order''', '''blanket purchase agreement''' or '''call-off order''' &lt;ref&gt;University of Manchester, [http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=8182 Call‐off Orders: Awareness of call‐off orders and their use], accessed 24 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[purchase order]] which a [[customer]] places with its [[Vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] to allow multiple delivery dates over a period of time, often negotiated to take advantage of predetermined [[pricing]]. It is normally used when there is a recurring need for expendable goods. Blanket orders are often used when a customer buys large quantities and has obtained special discounts. Based on the blanket order, sales orders ('blanket releases' or 'release orders') and invoice items can be created as needed until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached or a pre-determined maximum order value is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working with sales blanket orders|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa498438(v=ax.10).aspx|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Issuing a blanket order allows a customer not to hold more stock than necessary at any time, and avoids the administrative expense of processing frequent purchase orders, while favoring [[discount pricing]] through volume commitments or [[price break]]s. On the supplier's side, a blanket order may provide the benefit of guaranteeing ongoing business and also help suppliers better predict future cash flows and orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomassini-Buechner|first1=Bogdan|title=Blanket Orders: What You Need To Know|url=https://www.digitalpurchaseorder.com/blanket-orders/|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=April 2017}}

A blanket order is set at a fixed priced contract for a period of time. The buyer looks for the best pricing among competing supplier bids. After the best one is chosen, the prices of goods are fixed, and also quantities of each products are given to the supplier to prepare stock for on requested delivery.

Forecasted quantity is provided by the buyer as full usage quantity recorded historically few years or as needed for quantitative analysis. The supplier may give a condition of quantity to supply for this [contract]. For example, 80% of the forecast quantity must be bought at the end of the contract, which may be one or two years.

The blanket order will charge the delay delivery if the supplier could not supply the products in the contract on time. Anyway, since the supplier has already kept the stock for ready delivery for the first year or agreed period, if the buyer could not fulfill the contract's conditions, such as "must buy 80% of [[forecast quantity]] within a year," the contract may be extended, or the delay charge could be no more, or no other charges requested by the buyer.

Realistically, at the end of the blanket order [[contract]], the buyer would not buy at forecasted quantity as agreed in the contract say, 80% of the demand sent to the supplier. The buyer will also allow the supplier to sell the products in the contract to reduce the quantity. The supplier also has to talk and inform the buyer the quantities of goods kept in order that the buyer could know the status of the stock.  Before the buyer issuing the purchase order to supplier, the buyer must ask the supplier first about stock availability to avoid the problem from no stock availability.

Blanket orders or call-off orders may also be used for ordering services, for example for [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance and repair]] services. In these cases the benefits associated with stock-holding do not arise but the call-off order may allow emergency repairs or on-call maintenance to be arranged easily at guaranteed rates.

==Difficulties==
The most difficult part of having a contract is determining the forecast quantity arranged by the user of the product. As the forecast quantity can be difficult to get, the supplier must be aware of the quantity to keep in stock. An easy way to do this is to discuss with the buyer what quantity to keep in stock. For example, they might keep only 20% in stock in the first 6 months, so that the supplier and the buyer are able to review the quantity and adjust it appropriately. This reduces the [[stock burden]] of the supplier during the contract period and might help the buyer at the end of the contract if the stock does not move as quickly as anticipated. The contract might be extended year after year, but it can be adjusted each time as more relevant forecasting history will predicate the need to decrease or increase stock requirements. Alternatively, some companies may utilize forecasted information via a [[material requirements planning]] system to determine appropriate stock quantities throughout the [[Product lifecycle|product's life cycle]].

==Federal Acquisition Regulation==
The United States' [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] uses the term "blanket purchase agreements" or BPAs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%208_4.html#wp1089547 FAR 8.405-3], accessed 24 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. [[General Services Administration]], BPAs:
* Provide opportunities to negotiate improved discounts
* Satisfy recurring requirements
* Reduce administrative costs by eliminating repetitive acquisition efforts
* Permit ordering activities to leverage buying power through volume purchasing
* Enable ordering activities streamlined ordering procedures
* Permit ordering activities to incorporate Contractor Team Arrangements (CTAs)
* Reduce procurement lead time
* Permit ordering activities the ability to incorporate terms and conditions not in conflict with the underlying contract.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. General Services Administration [http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/199353 Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Broadband Lifecycle''' is a [[Economic model|model]] for looking at the planning, implementation, and adoption of [[broadband networks]], providing a framework for understanding the natural progression and sound business planning to drive local economic development through broadband (high-speed Internet networks).

Thus, the Broadband Lifecycle considers broadband from a “[[Demand (economics)|demand side]],” recognizing that adoption and utilization only comes through understanding benefits, supporting the [[Demand (economics)|Demand side]] and the benefits for communities, demonstrating to individual businesses, organizations and households the value of broadband and its transformative effects through Internet enabled applications, which include global market reach, ability to [[Telecommuting|telework]], use of [[telemedicine]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Strategic_Networks_Group%27s_Broadband_Lifecycle.jpg Broadband Lifecycle Approach]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business-IT alignment''' is a dynamic state in which a [[Company|business organization]] is able to use [[information technology]] (IT) to achieve business objectives - typically improved financial performance or marketplace [[competitiveness]].  Some definitions focus more on outcomes (the ability of IT to produce business value) than means (the harmony between IT and business [[decision-maker]]s within the organizations); for example, &lt;blockquote&gt; ''alignment is the capacity to demonstrate a positive relationship between information technologies and the accepted financial [[measures of performance]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strassmann.com/pubs/alignment/ What is Alignment? Alignment is The Delivery Of The Required Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This alignment is in contrast to what is often experienced in organizations: IT and business professionals unable to bridge the gap between themselves because of differences in objectives, culture, and incentives and a mutual ignorance for the other group's [[body of knowledge]]. This rift generally results in expensive IT systems that do not provide adequate [[return on investment]].  For this reason, the search for business-IT alignment is closely associated with attempts to improve the business value of IT investments.

Business-IT alignment integrates the information technology to the strategy, mission, and goals of the organization. Key characteristics in order to achieve this alignment are:
#The organization must view information technology as an instrument to transform the business. This includes exploring other revenue streams and integrating other facets of their business into each other. For example, using one central [[data warehouse]] to combine two separate, but partnering businesses.
#An organization must hold customer service, both externally and internally, at the utmost importance. Communication between the organization and their customers must not be lost.
#An organization must rotate both IT and business professionals across different departments and job functions. They must have the knowledge and experience of both sides of the business so that understanding and communication is achieved. Once those three characteristics are achieved,
#An organization must provide clear and specific goals to both the IT and business employees. This will create the integration of both entities to achieve a common goal.
#Ensure that IT and business employees understand how the company makes or loses money. This is important so that money is not carelessly poured into the IT department and there is no return on that investment.
#Organizations must create a vibrant and inclusive [[company culture]]. There must not only be informational unity, but a company as whole.

It is not unusual for business and IT professionals within an organization to experience conflict and in-fighting as lack of mutual understanding and the failure to produce desired results leads to blaming and mistrust. The search for B/I alignment often includes efforts to establish trust between these two groups and a mechanism for consensus [[decision-making]].

== B/I alignment and IT governance ==

To achieve B/I alignment, organizations must make better decisions that take into account both business and IT disciplines. Establishing processes for decision-making and control is essentially what is meant by the term "governance"; so B/I alignment is closely related to [[information technology governance]].

A commonly cited definition by IT Governance Institute is:&lt;blockquote&gt;''IT governance is the responsibility of the board of directors and executive management. It is an integral part of enterprise governance and consists of the leadership and organisational structures and processes that ensure that the organisation’s IT sustains and extends the organization’s strategies and objectives''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sohanroy.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:BITAconcept.jpg]] --&gt;

Also related to the effort for better decision-making, and therefore often part of B/I alignment - is the area of [[IT portfolio management]], which has to do with decisions about which IT projects are funded and which are not.

== B/I alignment and business transformation ==

Ultimately, value must come not just from the IT tools that are selected, but also in the way that they are used in the organization. For this reason, the scope of B/I alignment also includes business transformation, in which organizations redesign how work is accomplished in order to realize efficiencies made possible by new IT.  Thus, implementing IT to achieve its full potential for business value includes not only a technical component, but also an organizational [[change management]] component (see the Risk3 model below).

It is important to consider the overall value chain in technology development projects as the challenge for the value creation is increasing with the growing competitiveness between organizations that has become evident ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101014034657/http://harvardbookstore.biz/ Bird, 2010]). The concept of value creation through technology is heavily dependent upon the alignment of technology and business strategies. While the value creation for an organization is a network of relationships between internal and external environments, technology plays an important role in improving the overall value chain of an organization. However, this increase requires business and technology management to work as a creative, synergistic, and collaborative team instead of a purely mechanistic span of control. Technology can help the organization recognize improved competitive advantage within the industry it resides and generate superior performance at a greater value, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101014034657/http://harvardbookstore.biz/] according to Bird (&lt;ref&gt;

== Alignment models ==

Henderson &amp; Venkatraman can be seen as the founding fathers of business/IT alignment and published an article called ''Strategic Alignment: Leveraging Information Technology for transforming organisations - IBM Systems Journal, vol32, NO1''.

Typical [[Enterprise architecture framework|EA Frameworks]] are used to achieve business-IT alignment, as these frameworks links business and technology layers of organization over common threads.

[[The Open Group Architecture Framework|TOGAF]] is a framework by Open Group which defines a very strong method of developing the enterprise architecture. The method is called ADM (architecture development method)

[[Zachman Framework|Zachman EA framework]] is developed by John Zachman and it defines which artifacts enterprises need to develop to be able to organize themselves better. It is also widely accepted framework in the industry.

In the Risk3&lt;ref&gt;[http://changethebusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/risk3.pdf Risk3 Assessment - Are You Managing the Three Risks that Threaten Your IT Implementation? (-- needs a paiement)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; model, the objective of B/I alignment is to manage three separate risks associated with IT projects: technical risk (will the system function as it should?), organizational risk (will individuals within the organization use the system as they should?), and business risk (will the implementation and adoption of the system translate into business value?).  Business value is jeopardized unless all three risks are managed successfully.

A '''business analyst''' ('''BA''') is someone who analyzes an organization or business domain (real or hypothetical) and documents its business or processes or systems, assessing the business model or its integration with technology.

The role of a [[systems analyst]] can also be defined as a bridge&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; between the business problems and the technology [[solution selling|solutions]]. Here business problems can be anything about business systems, for example the model, process, or method. The technology solutions can be the use of technology architecture, tools, or [[software applications]]. System analysts are required to analyze, transform and ultimately resolve the business problems with the help of technology.

==Areas of business analysis==
There are at least four types of [[business analysis]]:
# [[Business developer]] – to identify the organization's business needs and business' opportunities
# [[Business model|Business model analysis]] – to define the organization's policies and market approaches
# Process design – to standardize the organization’s [[workflow]]s
# [[Systems analysis]] – the interpretation of [[business rule]]s and requirements for technical systems (generally within IT)

The business analyst, sometimes, is someone who is a part of the business operation and works with Information Technology to improve the quality of the services being delivered, sometimes assisting in Integration and Testing of new solutions. Business Analysts act as a liaison between management and technical developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/business-analyst/|title=How to Become a Business Analyst {{!}} Business Analyst Salary|work=Master's in Data Science|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BA may also support the development of training material, participates in the implementation, and provides post-implementation support. This may involve the development of project plans and [[dataflow diagram]]s, [[flowchart]]s
# To-be processes, e.g. dataflow diagrams, flowcharts
# [[Data models]], i.e. data requirements expressed as a documented data model of some sort
# [[Business case]], a strategic plan containing shareholders risk and return

The BA records requirements in some form of requirements management tool, whether a simple spreadsheet or a complex application.
Within the systems development life cycle, the business analyst typically performs a liaison function between the business side of an enterprise and the providers of IT services.

==Industries==
BAs work in different industries such as [[finance]], [[banking]], insurance, [[Telecommunication|telecoms]], utilities, software services, government and so on. Due to working on projects at a fairly high level of abstraction, BAs can switch between any and all industries.

The business domain subject areas BAs may work in include workflow, billing, mediation, provisioning and [[customer relationship management]]. The telecom industry has mapped these functional areas in their Telecommunications Operational Map (eTOM) model, Banking in the [[Information Framework|Information Framework (IFW)]] and Emergency agencies in the Prevention Preparation Response and Recovery model (PPRR).

Finally, business analysts do not have a predefined and fixed role, as they can take part in operations scaling, sales planning, strategy devising or the developmental process.

'''Business ethics'''  (also known as '''corporate ethics''') is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]], that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-business/|title=Business Ethics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ethics originate from individuals, organizational statements or from the legal system. These norms, values, ethical, and unethical practices are what is used to guide business. They help those businesses maintain a better connection with their stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=C.|first=Ferrell, O.|others=Fraedrich, John., Ferrell, Linda.|isbn=9781305500846|edition= Eleventh |location=Boston, MA|oclc=937450119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business ethics refers to contemporary organizational standards, principles, sets of values and norms that govern the actions and behavior of an individual in the business organization. Business ethics have two dimensions, [[normative business ethics]] or [[descriptive business ethics]]. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns.

Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, most major corporations today promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters.

Adam Smith said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A (1776/ 1952) An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control. The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones, Parker, et al.|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

Maintaining an ethical status is the responsibility of the manager of the business. According to the Journal of Business Ethics ''"Managing ethical behavior is one of the most pervasive and complex problems facing business organizations today"''&lt;ref&gt;Stead, W.E., Worrell, D.L. and Stead, J.G., 1990. An integrative model for understanding and managing ethical behavior in business organizations. Journal of Business Ethics, 9(3), pp.233-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Business ethics reflect the norms of each historical period. As time passes, norms evolve, causing accepted behaviors to become objectionable. Business ethics and the resulting behavior evolved as well. Business was involved in [[slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4471479045063533294&amp;hl=en# Slavery and the Making of America—Episode 1]. Video.google.com.

The term 'business ethics' came into common use in the United States in the early 1970s. By the mid-1980s at least 500 courses in business ethics reached 40,000 students, using some twenty textbooks and at least ten casebooks supported by professional societies, centers and journals of business ethics. The Society for Business Ethics was founded in 1980. European business schools adopted business ethics after 1987 commencing with the European Business Ethics Network.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T.

Firms began highlighting their ethical stature in the late 1980s and early 1990s, possibly in an attempt to distance themselves from the business scandals of the day, such as the [[savings and loan crisis]].

=== Religious and philosophical origins ===
One of the earliest written treatments of business ethics is found in the [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]], a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] book dated variously from 300 BCE to 7th century CE and attributed to [[Thiruvalluvar]]. Many verses discuss business ethics, in particular verse 113, adapting to a changing environment in verses 474, 426, and 140, learning the intricacies of different tasks in verses 462 and 677.&lt;ref&gt;Management Thoughts in Thirukkural by K.

==Overview==
Business ethics reflects the [[philosophy of business]], of which one aim is to determine the fundamental purposes of a company. If a company's purpose is to maximize shareholder returns, then sacrificing profits for other concerns is a violation of its [[fiduciary responsibility]]. Corporate entities are legally considered as persons in the United States and in most nations. The 'corporate persons' are legally entitled to the rights and liabilities due to citizens as persons.

Ethics are the rules or standards that govern our decisions on a daily basis. Many consider “ethics” with conscience or a simplistic sense of “right” and “wrong.” Others would say that ethics is an internal code that governs an individual’s conduct, ingrained into each person by family, faith, tradition, community, laws, and personal mores. Corporations and professional organizations, particularly licensing boards, generally will have a written “Code of Ethics” that governs standards of professional conduct expected of all in the field.
It is important to note that “law” and “ethics” are not synonymous, nor are the “legal” and “ethical” courses of action in a given situation necessarily the same. Statutes and regulations passed by legislative bodies and administrative boards set forth the “law.” Slavery once was legal in the US, but one certainly wouldn’t say enslaving another was an “ethical” act.

Economist [[Milton Friedman]] writes that corporate executives' "responsibility... generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom".&lt;ref name=mf1970&gt;{{cite news|first=Milton|last=Friedman|title=The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits |date=1970-09-13|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |accessdate=March 11, 2011 |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.friedman.html &lt;!-- backup urls http://www.oppapers.com/essays/The-Social-Responsibility-Of-Business-Is/317417 http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html --&gt;|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317042848/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.friedman.html |archivedate=March 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Friedman also said, "the only entities who can have responsibilities are individuals ... A business cannot have responsibilities. So the question is, do corporate executives, provided they stay within the law, have responsibilities in their business activities other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible? And my answer to that is, no, they do not."&lt;ref name=mf1970/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, M. (1984). "Milton Friedman responds—an interview with Friedman."

(1981). " What is business ethics?"

Another view of business is that it must exhibit [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR): an umbrella term indicating that an ethical business must act as a responsible citizen of the communities in which it operates even at the cost of profits or other goals.&lt;ref&gt;Pinnington, A.

For example, they can hold title to property, sue and be sued and are subject to taxation, although their [[free speech]] rights are limited. This can be interpreted to imply that they have independent ethical responsibilities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Duska argues that stakeholders have the right to expect a business to be ethical; if business has no ethical obligations, other institutions could make the same claim which would be counterproductive to the corporation.&lt;ref name=Duska/&gt;

Ethical issues include the rights and duties between a company and its [[stakeholder theory|employees, suppliers, customers and neighbors]], its [[fiduciary]] responsibility to its [[shareholder]]s. Issues concerning relations between different companies include [[takeover|hostile take-overs]] and [[industrial espionage]]. Related issues include [[corporate governance]]; [[Corporate Social Entrepreneurship|corporate social entrepreneurship]]; [[Campaign finance reform|political contributions]]; legal issues such as the ethical debate over introducing a crime of [[corporate manslaughter]]; and the marketing of corporations' ethics policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The way a corporate psychopath can rise in a company is by their manipulation, scheming, and bullying. They do this in a way that can hide their true character and intentions within a company.

==Functional business areas==
===Finance===
Fundamentally, finance is a social science discipline.&lt;ref name="Dobson, p. xvii"&gt;{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline borders [[behavioral economics]], sociology,&lt;ref&gt;Cetina, K. K., &amp; Preda, A. (Eds.). (2005). The sociology of financial markets. Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-929692-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; economics, accounting and management. It concerns technical issues such as the mix of debt and [[equity (finance)|equity]], [[dividend policy]], the evaluation of alternative investment projects, [[options strategies|options]], [[futures exchange|futures]], [[swap (finance)|swaps]], and other [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] and many others. Finance is often mistaken by the people to be a discipline free from ethical burdens.&lt;ref name="Dobson, p. xvii"/&gt; The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]] caused critics to challenge the ethics of the executives in charge of U.S. and European financial institutions and financial regulatory bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Huevel, K. et al., (2009).

====Finance paradigm====
&lt;!--"finance paradigm" needs a definition --&gt;
[[Aristotle]] said, "the end and purpose of the polis is the good life".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle 1948 Politics E. Barker, trans.

Dobson observes, "a rational agent is simply one who pursues personal material advantage ad infinitum. In essence, to be rational in finance is to be individualistic, materialistic, and competitive. Business is a game played by individuals, as with all games the object is to win, and winning is measured in terms solely of material wealth. Within the discipline this rationality concept is never questioned, and has indeed become the theory-of-the-firm's sine qua non".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|p=ix}} "Experts of finance tend to view business firm as, 'an abstract engine that uses money today to make money tomorrow'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/296380|author=Miller, M.

Such simplifying assumptions were once necessary for the construction of mathematically robust models. However, [[signalling (economics)|signalling theory]] and [[Principal-agent problem|agency theory]] extended the paradigm to greater realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|pp=xvi, 142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once hired, employees have the right to occasional cost of living increases, as well as raises based on merit.  Promotions, however, are not a right, and there are often fewer openings than qualified applicants. It may seem unfair if an employee who has been with a company longer is passed over for a promotion, but it is not unethical. It is only unethical if the employer did not give the employee proper consideration or used improper criteria for the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;DeGeorge, Richard. "Business Ethics, Seventh Edition". Prentice Hall, 2010, p. 351-352.&lt;/ref&gt; Each employer should know the distinction between what is unethical and what is illegal. If an action is illegal it is breaking the law but if an action seems morally incorrect that is unethical. In the workplace what is unethical does not mean illegal and should follow the guidelines put in place by OSHA, EEOC, and other law binding entities.

Potential employees have ethical obligations to employers, involving intellectual property protection and [[whistle-blowing]].

Employers must consider [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]], which may involve modifying the workplace, or providing appropriate training or hazard disclosure. This differentiates on the location and type of work that is taking place and can needs to comply with the standards to protect employees and non-employees under workplace safety.

Larger economic issues such as [[immigration]], [[trade policy]], [[globalization]] and [[trade union]]ism affect workplaces and have an ethical dimension, but are often beyond the purview of individual companies.&lt;ref name=pin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legge, K.

===Sales and marketing===
{{Main|Marketing ethics}}
Marketing ethics came of age only as late as the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2002|pp=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing ethics was approached from ethical perspectives of virtue or [[virtue ethics]], [[deontology]], [[consequentialism]], [[pragmatic ethics|pragmatism]] and relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones, Parker, et al.|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2002|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics in marketing deals with the principles, values and/or ideals by which marketers (and marketing institutions) ought to act.&lt;ref&gt;Brenkert, G. K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PDXVnfyKHBIC&amp;pg=PA179 Marketing ethics].{{harvnb|Frederic|2002|pp=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing ethics is also contested terrain, beyond the previously described issue of potential conflicts between profitability and other concerns.

According to Borgerson, and Schroeder (2008), marketing can influence individuals' perceptions of and interactions with other people, implying an ethical responsibility to avoid distorting those perceptions and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Borgerson, J.

Marketing ethics involves pricing practices, including illegal actions such as [[price fixing]] and legal actions including [[price discrimination]] and [[price skimming]]. Certain promotional activities have drawn fire, including  [[greenwash]]ing, [[bait and switch]], [[shill]]ing, [[viral marketing]], [[spam (electronic)]], [[pyramid scheme]]s and [[multi-level marketing]]. Advertising has raised objections about [[attack ad]]s, [[subliminal message]]s, [[sex in advertising]] and [[marketing in schools]].

===Emerging issues===
Being the most important element of a business, stakeholders' main concern is to determine whether or not the business is behaving ethically or unethically. The business' actions and decisions should be primarily ethical before it happens to become an ethical or even legal issue. "In the case of the government, community, and society what was merely an ethical issue can become a legal debate and eventually law."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making &amp; Cases, 11e. O.C Ferrell, John Fraedrich and Linda Ferrell&lt;/ref&gt;
Some unethical issues are:

1. '''Fairness'''
The three aspects that motivate people to be fair is; equality, optimization, and reciprocity. Fairness is the quality of being just, equitable, and impartial.

2. '''Misuse of company's times &amp; Resources'''
This particular topic may not seems to be a very common one, but it is very important, as it costs a company billions of dollars on a yearly basis. This misuse is from late arrivals, leaving early, long lunch breaks, inappropriate sick days etc. This has been observed as a major form of misconduct in businesses today. One of the greatest ways employees participate in misuse of company's time and resources is by using the company computer for personal use.

3. '''Consumer Fraud'''
There are many different types of fraud, namely; friendly fraud, return fraud, wardrobing, price arbitrage, returning stolen goods.
Fraud is a major unethical practice within businesses which should be paid special attention. Consumer fraud is when consumers attempt to deceive businesses for their very own benefit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

4. '''Abusive Behavior'''
A common ethical issue among employees. Abusive behavior consists of inflicting intimidating acts on other employees. Such acts include harassing, using profanity, threatening someone physically and insulting them, and being annoying.&lt;ref&gt;Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making &amp; Cases, 9e. O.C Ferrell, John Fraedrich and Linda Ferrell&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
This area of business ethics usually deals with the duties of a company to ensure that products and production processes do not needlessly cause harm. Since few goods and services can be produced and consumed with zero risk, determining the ethical course can be problematic. In some case consumers demand products that harm them, such as [[tobacco]] products. Production may have environmental impacts, including [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]] and [[urban sprawl]]. The downstream effects of technologies [[nuclear power]], [[genetically modified food]] and [[mobile phone]]s may not be well understood. While the [[precautionary principle]] may prohibit introducing new technology whose consequences are not fully understood, that principle would have prohibited most new technology introduced since the [[industrial revolution]]. Product testing protocols have been attacked for violating the rights of both [[clinical trials|humans]] and [[animal testing|animals]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}With technology growing there are sources and websites that provide list and information on companies and business and that are "green" or do not test on animals. These companies often advertise this and are growing in popularity among the younger generations.

===Property===
{{Main|Private property||Property rights}}

The etymological root of property is the [[Latin]] 'proprius'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=property Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to 'nature', 'quality', 'one's own', 'special characteristic', 'proper', 'intrinsic', 'inherent', 'regular', 'normal', 'genuine', 'thorough, complete, perfect' etc. The word property is value loaded and associated with the personal qualities of propriety and respectability, also implies questions relating to ownership. A 'proper' person owns and is true to herself or himself, and is thus genuine, perfect and pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern history of property rights====
Modern discourse on property emerged by the turn of the 17th century within theological discussions of that time. For instance, [[John Locke]] justified [[property rights]] saying that God had made "the earth, and all inferior creatures, [in] common to all men".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J.W. (1996), "Who owns My Body", Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 16: 55–84. Harris finds this argument a 'spectacular non sequitur,' '[f]rom the fact that nobody owns me if I am not a slave, it simply does not follow that I must own myself'(p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/2218464|author=Day, P. J.|year=1966|title=Locke on Property|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=16|issue=64|pages=207–220|jstor=2218464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 [[Utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] stated, "property and law are born together and die together".&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, J. (1931), Theory of Legislation, London: Kegan Paul, p. 113 {{ISBN|978-1-103-20150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument for property ownership is that it enhances individual liberty by extending the line of non-interference by the state or others around the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seen from this perspective, property right is absolute and property has a special and distinctive character that precedes its legal protection. Blackstone conceptualized property as the "sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, W. (1766), [http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-201.htm Commentaries on the Laws of England, Volume II, Of the Rights of Things], Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Slaves as property=====
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, slavery spread to European colonies including America, where colonial legislatures defined the legal status of slaves as a form of property. During this time settlers began the centuries-long process of dispossessing the natives of America of millions of acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;Wishart, D. J. (1994). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TgLHoEwA0fgC&amp;printsec=frontcover An Unspeakable Sadness The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians].

Michael observes that Thomas Jefferson, in spite of all his freedom speeches, was himself a slave owner, owning slaves as his property, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with theological justification, property was taken to be essentially natural ordained by God. Property, which later gained meaning as ownership and appeared natural to Locke, Jefferson and to many of the 18th and 19th century intellectuals as land, labour or idea and property right over slaves had the same [[Christianity and slavery|theological]] and [[essentialism|essentialized]] justification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daykin|first=Jeffer B.|title="They Themselves Contribute to Their Misery by Their Sloth": The Justification of Slavery in Eighteenth-Century French Travel Narratives|journal=The European Legacy|volume=11|page=623|year=2006|doi=10.1080/10848770600918117|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, D.

Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Following a bitter debate over the importation of slaves from abroad, Congress was denied the authority to prohibit the slave trade until 1808. The rendition of escaped slaves was also a priority for southerners. Accordingly, the fugitive slave clause declared that persons held to service or labor under state law "shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due." (Ely, 2008:46)&lt;/ref&gt; Wiecek noted, "slavery was more clearly and explicitly established under the Constitution as it had been under the Articles".&lt;ref&gt;Wiecek, W. M. (1977). The Sources of Antislavery Constitutionalism in America, 1760–1848. New York: Cornell University Press:63&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] in his 1857 judgment stated, "The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution".

R. (1927). Property and Sovereignty. Cornell Law Quarterly, 13, 8–30. Cohen commenting on the power dimension of property noted, "we must not overlook the actual fact that dominion over things is also imperium over our fellow human beings" p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Rose finds, "'Property' is only an effect, a construction, of relationships between people, meaning that its objective character is contestable. Persons and things, are 'constituted' or 'fabricated' by legal and other normative techniques.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Property' has no essential character, but is rather a highly flexible set of rights and responsibilities which congeal in different ways in different contexts" {{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer observes, "A private property regime is not, after all, a Hobbesian state of nature; it requires a working legal system that can define, allocate, and enforce property rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singer|2000|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis claims that common law theory generally favors the view that "property is not essentially a 'right to a thing', but rather a separable bundle of rights subsisting between persons which may vary according to the context and the object which is at stake".&lt;ref name="Davies 2007 20"/&gt;

In common parlance property rights involve a '[[bundle of rights]]'&lt;ref&gt;Cooter, R. and T. Ulen (1988). ''Law and Economics''.

Ownership has thus been interpreted as a form of aggregation of such social relations—a bundle of rights over the use of scarce resources . Alchian, A. A. (1965). Some Economics of Property Rights.

In the neoliberal literature, property is part of the private side of a public/private dichotomy and acts a counterweight to state power.&lt;!-- need a cite from that literature--&gt; Davies counters that "any space may be subject to plural meanings or appropriations which do not necessarily come into conflict".

Private property has never been a universal doctrine, although since the end of the Cold War is it has become nearly so. Some societies, e.g., Native American bands, held land, if not all property, in common. When groups came into conflict, the victor often [[Indian Removal Act|appropriated]] the loser's property.&lt;ref&gt;Fischbach, M. R. (2003).

Ethics of property rights begins with recognizing the vacuous nature of the notion of property.

===Intellectual property===
{{main|Intellectual property|Intellectual property rights}}
[[Intellectual property]] (IP) encompasses expressions of ideas, thoughts, codes and information. "[[Intellectual property rights]]" (IPR) treat IP as a kind of [[real property]], subject to analogous protections, rather than as a reproducible good or service. Boldrin and Levine argue that "government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect. The question we address is whether it also, creates social benefits commensurate with these social costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boldrin|Levine|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International standards relating to Intellectual Property Rights are enforced through [[Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]. In the US, IP other than [[copyright]]s is regulated by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].

The [[US Constitution]] included the power to protect intellectual property, empowering the Federal government "''to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries''".&lt;ref name=steel&gt;Steelman, A. Intellectual Property.{{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008 |pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boldrin and Levine see no value in such state-enforced monopolies stating, "we ordinarily think of innovative monopoly as an [[oxymoron]].&lt;ref&gt;Välimäki, M. (2005). The Rise of Open Source Licensing: A Challenge to the Use of Intellectual Property in the Software Industry. Helsinki: Turre Publishing {{ISBN|952-91-8769-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further they comment, 'intellectual property' "is not like ordinary property at all, but constitutes a government grant of a costly and dangerous private monopoly over ideas. We show through theory and example that intellectual monopoly is not necessary for innovation and as a practical matter is damaging to growth, prosperity, and liberty".&lt;ref name=steel/&gt; Steelman defends patent monopolies, writing, "Consider prescription drugs, for instance. Such drugs have benefited millions of people, improving or extending their lives. Patent protection enables drug companies to recoup their development costs because for a specific period of time they have the sole right to manufacture and distribute the products they have invented."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court cases by 39 pharmaceutical companies against [[South Africa]]'s 1997 Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act, which intended to provide affordable HIV medicines has been cited as a harmful effect of patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.udayton.edu/Health/06world/africa01.htm The South African Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Bill and TRIPS].

AIDS, TRIPS and 'TRIPS plus': the case for developing and less developed countries. {{harvnb|Andersen|2006|pp=70–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Isn't the ethical issue not the existence of patents, but the misuse of them in the above circumstance? --&gt;

One attack on IPR is moral rather than utilitarian, claiming that inventions are mostly a collective, cumulative, path dependent, social creation and therefore, no one person or firm should be able to monopolize them even for a limited period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|2006|pp=109–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing argument is that the benefits of innovation arrive sooner when patents encourage innovators and their investors to increase their commitments. Roderick Long, a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] philosopher, observes, "Ethically, property rights of any kind have to be justified as extensions of the right of individuals to control their own lives.&lt;!-- why is increased autonomy the only basis? --&gt; Thus any alleged property rights that conflict with this moral basis—like the "right" to own slaves—are invalidated. In my judgment, intellectual property rights also fail to pass this test. To enforce copyright laws and the like is to prevent people from making peaceful use of the information they possess.&lt;!--this sounds like the forced appropriation critiqued above--&gt; If you have acquired the information legitimately (say, by buying a book), then on what grounds can you be prevented from using it, reproducing it, trading it?&lt;!--you pay for whatever the author wishes to sell you. As above, don't you have obligations?...--&gt; Is this not a violation of the freedom of speech and press? It may be objected that the person who originated the information deserves ownership rights over it. But information is not a concrete thing an individual can control; it is a universal, existing in other people's minds and other people's property, and over these the originator has no legitimate sovereignty. You cannot own information without owning other people".&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Long in {{harvnb|Hamowy|Kuznicki|Steelman|2008|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machlup concluded that patents do not have the intended effect of enhancing innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Machlup, F. (1958). An Economic Review of the Patent System. Washington D.C.: US Government Printing Office, p. 80. Expressing similar concern Fritz Machlup wrote, "It would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present knowledge of its economic consequences, to recommend instituting [a patent system]."&lt;/ref&gt; Self-declared [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], in his 1847 seminal work noted, "Monopoly is the natural opposite of competition," and continued, "Competition is the vital force which animates the collective being: to destroy it, if such a supposition were possible, would be to kill society"&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon (1847), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/philosophy/ch06.htm Chapter VI] in The Philosophy of Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Sherman Antitrust Act|Sherman Act]] of 1890, was passed in America to stop rampant cartelization and monopolization in the American economy, followed by the [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act]] of 1914, [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] of 1914,[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2_20_I.html] and the [[Robinson-Patman Act|Anti-Price Discrimination Act]] of 1936. In recent years, "[[antitrust]]" enforcement is alleged to have reduced competition.

Notable IP copyright cases include [[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.|Napster]], [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]] and [[Air Pirates]].

==International issues==
While business ethics emerged as a field in the 1970s, international business ethics did not emerge until the late 1990s, looking back on the international developments of that decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Georges|last=Enderle|year=1999|title=International Business Ethics|page=1|publisher=[[University of Notre Dame Press]]|isbn=0-268-01214-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new practical issues arose out of the international context of business. Theoretical issues such as cultural relativity of ethical values receive more emphasis in this field. Other, older issues can be grouped here as well. Issues and subfields include:
*The search for universal values as a basis for international commercial behaviour.
*Comparison of business ethical traditions in different countries. Also, on the basis of their respective GDP and [Corruption rankings].
*Comparison of business ethical traditions from various religious perspectives.
*Ethical issues arising out of international business transactions; e.g., [[bioprospecting]] and biopiracy in the pharmaceutical industry; the [[fair trade]] movement; [[transfer pricing]].
*Issues such as [[globalization]] and [[cultural imperialism]].
*Varying global standards—e.g., the use of [[child labor]].
*The way in which multinationals take advantage of international differences, such as outsourcing production (e.g. clothes) and services (e.g. call centres) to low-wage countries.
*The permissibility of international commerce with pariah states.

The success of any business depends on its financial performance. Financial accounting helps the management to report and also, control the business performance.

The information regarding the financial performance of the company plays an important role in enabling people to take right decision about the company. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand how to record based on accounting conventions and concepts ensure unambling and accurate records.

Foreign countries often use dumping as a competitive threat, selling products at prices lower than their normal value. This can lead to problems in domestic markets. It becomes difficult for these markets to compete with the pricing set by foreign markets. In 2009, the International Trade Commission has been researching anti-dumping laws. Dumping is often seen as an ethical issue, as larger companies are taking advantage of other less economically advanced companies.

==Issues==
Ethical issues often arise in business settings, whether through business transactions or forming new business relationships. An [[Ethics|ethical issue]] in a business atmosphere may refer to any situation that requires business associates as individuals, or as a group (for example, a department or firm) to evaluate the [[morality]] of specific actions, and subsequently make a decision amongst the choices. Some ethical issues of particular concern in today's evolving business market include such topics as: [[honesty]], [[integrity]], professional behaviors, [[environmental issue]]s, [[harassment]], and [[fraud]] to name a few. It is integral to the success of an organization that ethics issues such as these be properly addressed and resolved. Businesses should strive to educate themselves on these issues, and ethical practices in general. From a 2009 National Business Ethics survey, it was found that types of employee-observed ethical misconduct included abusive behavior (at a rate of 22 percent), [[discrimination]] (at a rate of 14 percent), improper hiring practices (at a rate of 10 percent), and company resource abuse (at a rate of percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Ferrell|first=Linda|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=978-1-111-82516-4|location=Mason, OH|pages=61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethical issues associated with honesty are widespread and vary greatly in business, from the misuse of company time or resources to lying with malicious intent, engaging in [[bribery]], or creating conflicts of interest within an organization. Honesty encompasses wholly the truthful speech and actions of an individual. Some cultures and belief systems even consider honesty to be an essential pillar of life, such as Confucianism and Buddhism (referred to as [[sacca]], part of the [[Four Noble Truths]]). Many employees lie in order to reach goals, avoid assignments or negative issues; however, sacrificing honesty in order to gain status or reap rewards poses potential problems for the overall ethical culture organization, and jeopardizes organizational goals in the long run. Using company time or resources for personal use is also, commonly viewed as unethical because it boils down to stealing from the company. The misuse of resources costs companies billions of dollars each year, averaging about 4.25 hours per week of stolen time alone, and employees' abuse of Internet services is another main concern.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Ferrell|first=O.C.|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=66, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bribery, on the other hand, is not only considered unethical is business practices, but it is also illegal. In accordance with this, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was established in 1977 to deter international businesses from giving or receiving unwarranted payments and gifts that were intended to influence the decisions of executives and political officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Marketing: Managing Across Borders and Cultures|last=Deresky|first=Helen|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2017|isbn=9780134376042|location=Hoboken|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, small payments known as [[Facilitating payment|facilitation payments]] will not be considered unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act if they are used towards regular public governance activities, such as permits or licenses.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Influential factors on business ethics ==
Many aspects in the work environment influence an individual's decision-making regarding ethics in the business world. When an individual is on the path of growing a company, many outside influences can pressure them to perform a certain way. The core of the person's performance in the workplace is rooted by their personal code of behavior. A person's personal code of ethics encompasses many different qualities such as integrity, honesty, communication, respect, compassion, and common goals. In addition, the ethical standards set forth by a person's superior(s) often translate into their own code of ethics. The company's policy is the 'umbrella' of ethics that play a major role in the personal development and decision-making processes that people make in respects to ethical behavior.

The ethics of a company and its' individuals are heavily influenced by the state of their country. If a country is heavily plagued with poverty, large corporations continuously grow, but smaller companies begin to wither, and are then forced to adapt and scavenge for any method of survival. As a result, the leadership of the company is often tempted to participate in unethical methods to obtain new business opportunities. Additionally, Social Media is arguably the most influential factor in ethics. The immediate access to so much information and the opinions of millions highly influence people's behaviors. The desire to confirm with what is portrayed as the norm often manipulates our idea of what is morally and ethically sound. Popular trends on social media and the instant gratification that is received from participating in such quickly distort people's ideas and decisions.

==Economic systems==
[[Political economy]] and [[political philosophy]] have ethical implications, particularly regarding the distribution of economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard de|last=George|year=1999|title=Business Ethics|isbn=0-412-46080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] are both notable contributors. For example, Rawls has been interpreted as [https://web.archive.org/web/20121124045211/http://works.bepress.com/julian_friedland/3/ offering a critique of offshore outsourcing] on social contract grounds, whereas Nozick's libertarian philosophy rejects the notion of any positive corporate social obligation.

==Law and regulation==
“[[Law]]s” are the written statutes, codes, and opinions of government organizations by which citizens, businesses, and persons present within a jurisdiction are expected to govern themselves or face legal sanction. Sanctions for [[law violation|violating]] the law can include (a) [[civil penalties]], such as fines, pecuniary damages, and loss of licenses, property, rights, or privileges; (b) criminal penalties, such as fines, probation, imprisonment, or a combination thereof; or (c) both civil and criminal penalties.

Very often it is held that business is not bound by any ethics other than abiding by the law. [[Milton Friedman]] is the pioneer of the view. He held that corporations have the obligation to make a profit within the framework of the legal system, nothing more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Machan|2007}}; {{harvnb|Frederic|2002|pp=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman made it explicit that the duty of the business leaders is, "to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in the law and those embodied in ethical custom".&lt;ref name=f1970&gt;Friedman, M. (1970). [http://www.oppapers.com/essays/The-Social-Responsibility-Of-Business-Is/317417 "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profit"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130130190539/http://www.oppapers.com/essays/The-Social-Responsibility-Of-Business-Is/317417 |date=2013-01-30 }}, ''The New York Times Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics for Friedman is nothing more than abiding by 'customs' and 'laws'. The reduction of ethics to abidance to laws and customs however have drawn serious criticisms.

Counter to Friedman's logic it is observed{{by whom|date=May 2012}} that legal procedures are technocratic, bureaucratic, rigid and obligatory where as ethical act is conscientious, voluntary choice beyond normativity.&lt;ref name=ag43&gt;Agamben, G.

==Implementation==
===Corporate policies===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}

{{See also|Corporate governance}}

As part of more comprehensive [[compliance and ethics program]]s, many companies have formulated internal policies pertaining to the ethical conduct of employees. These policies can be simple exhortations in broad, highly generalized language (typically called a corporate ethics statement), or they can be more detailed policies, containing specific behavioural requirements (typically called corporate ethics codes). They are generally meant to identify the company's expectations of workers and to offer guidance on handling some of the more common ethical problems that might arise in the course of doing business. It is hoped that having such a policy will lead to greater ethical awareness, consistency in application, and the avoidance of ethical disasters.

An increasing number of companies{{Who|date=November 2017}} also require employees to attend seminars regarding business conduct, which often include discussion of the company's policies, specific case studies, and legal requirements. Some companies even require their employees to sign agreements stating that they will abide by the company's rules of conduct.

Many companies{{Who|date=November 2017}} are assessing the environmental factors that can lead employees to engage in unethical conduct. A competitive business environment may call for unethical behaviour. Lying has become expected in fields such as trading. An example of this are the issues surrounding the unethical actions of the [[Salomon Brothers]].

Not everyone{{Who|date=November 2017}} supports corporate policies that govern ethical conduct. Some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon employees to use their own judgment.

Others{{Who|date=November 2017}} believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns, and that they are mainly to limit the company's legal liability, or to curry public favour by giving the appearance of being a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly.

Sometimes there is disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices{{Who|date=November 2017}}. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management, at worst, this makes the policy duplicitous, and, at best, it is merely a marketing tool.

Jones and Parker write, "Most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense, or a set of excuses for being unpleasant."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones, Parker, et al.|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas. For instance, US Department of Commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by 'ethics officers'.,&lt;ref name=program/&gt; some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones, Parker, et al.|2005|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business ethicists may trivialize the subject, offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity.&lt;ref name=ag43/&gt;

Author of 'Business Ethics,' Richard DeGeorge writes in regard to the importance of maintaining a corporate code, "Corporate codes have a certain usefulness and there are several advantages to developing them. First, the very exercise of doing so in itself is worthwhile, especially if it forces a large number of people in the firm to think through, in a fresh way, their mission and the important obligations they as a group and as individuals have to the firm, to each other, to their clients and customers, and to society as a whole. Second, once adopted a code can be used to generate continuing discussion and possible modification to the code. Third, it could help to inculcate in new employees at all levels the perspective of responsibility, the need to think in moral terms about their actions, and the importance of developing the virtues appropriate to their position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGeorge|first=Richard|title=Business Ethics|publisher=Prentice Hall|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics officers===
Following a series of fraud, corruption, and abuse scandals that affected the United States defense industry in the mid-1980s, the Defense Industry Initiative (DII) was created to promote ethical business practices and ethics management in multiple industries. Subsequent to these scandals, many organizations began appointing ethics officers (also referred to as "compliance" officers). In 1991, the [[Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer Association]] (ECOA)—originally the Ethics Officer Association (EOA)—was founded at the [[Center for Business Ethics]] at [[Bentley University]] as a professional association for ethics and compliance officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=11–13|oclc=937450119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 passing of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations in 1991 was another factor in many companies appointing ethics/compliance officers. These guidelines, intended to assist judges with sentencing, set standards organizations must follow to obtain a reduction in sentence if they should be convicted of a federal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=12–16|oclc=937450119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the high-profile corporate scandals of companies like [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]] and [[Tyco International|Tyco]] between 2001 and 2004, and following the passage of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]], many small and mid-sized companies also began to appoint ethics officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=12–14|oclc=937450119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, ethics officers focus on uncovering or preventing unethical and illegal actions. This is accomplished by assessing the ethical implications of the company's activities, making recommendations on ethical policies, and disseminating information to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937450119|title=Business ethics : ethical decision making and cases|last=Fraedrich|first=John|last2=Ferrell|first2=Linda|last3=Ferrell|first3=O.C.|isbn=1305500849|pages=228–229|oclc=937450119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of ethics officers is not clear. The establishment of an ethics officer position is likely to be insufficient in driving ethical business practices without a [[Organizational culture|corporate culture]] that values ethical behavior. These values and behaviors should be consistently and systemically supported by those at the top of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;"Business Ethics: Ethical Decision making and Cases", Ferrell Fredrich and Ferrell.&lt;/ref&gt; Employees with strong community involvement, loyalty to employers, superiors or owners, smart work practices, trust among the team members do inculcate a corporate culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bba12.weebly.com/uploads/9/4/2/8/9428277/9781133816300.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221053014/http://bba12.weebly.com/uploads/9/4/2/8/9428277/9781133816300.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Business Ethics: Ethical Decision making and cases", 9e, Ferrell Faredrich, Ferrell.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability Initiatives===
Many corporate and business strategies now include [[sustainability]]. In addition to the traditional environmental 'green' sustainability concerns, business ethics practices have expanded to include [[social sustainability]]. Social sustainability focuses on issues related to human capital in the business supply chain, such as [[worker's rights]], working conditions, [[Child labour|child labor]], and [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of these considerations is increasing, as consumers and procurement officials demand documentation of a business' compliance with national and international [https://sftool.gov/plan/546/social-sustainability-initiatives-guidelines-standards initiatives, guidelines, and standards]. Many industries have organizations dedicated to verifying ethical delivery of products from start to finish,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberly Process]], which aims to stop the flow of conflict diamonds into international markets, or the [[Fair Wear Foundation]], dedicated to sustainability and fairness in the garment industry.

As mentioned, initiatives in sustainability encompass “green” topics, as well as social sustainability. There are however many different ways in which sustainability initiatives can be implemented in a company.

Improving Operations: Perhaps the most evident manner in which an organization can implement sustainability initiatives is by improving its operations and manufacturing’s process so as to make it more aligned with environment, social, and governance issues.  Johnson &amp; Johnson incorporates policies from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, applying these principles not only for members of its supply chain but also internal operations. Walmart has made commitments to doubling its truck fleet efficiency by 2015 by replacing 2/3rds of its fleet with more fuel-efficient trucks, including hybrids. Dell has integrated alternative, recycled, and recyclable materials in its products and packaging design, improving energy efficiency and design for end-of-life and recyclability. Dell plans to reduce the energy intensity of its product portfolio by 80% by 2020.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/best-practices-sustainability-us-corporations-ceres&lt;/ref&gt;

Board Leadership: The board of a company can decide to lower executive compensation by a given percentage, and give the percentage of compensation to a specific cause. This is an effort which can only be implemented from the top, as it will affect the compensation of all executives in the company. In Alcoa, an aluminum company based in the USA, “1/5th of executive cash compensation is tied to safety, diversity, and environmental stewardship, which includes greenhouse gas emission reductions and energy efficiency” (Best Practices). This is not usually the case for most companies, where we see the board take a uniform step towards environment, social, and governance issues. This is only the case for companies that are directly linked to utilities, energy, or material industries, something which Alcoa as an aluminum company, falls in line with. Instead, formal committees focused on environment, social, and governance issues are more usually seen in governance committees and audit committees, rather than the board of directors. “According to research analysis done by Pearl Meyer in support of the NACD 2017 Director Compensation Report shows that among 1,400 public companies reviewed, only slightly more than five percent of boards have a designated committee to address ESG issues.” (How compensation can).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pearlmeyer.com/knowledge-share/article/how-compensation-can-support-improved-environmental-and-social-governance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Management Accountability: Similar to board leadership, creating steering committees and other types of committees specialized for sustainability, senior executives are identified who are held accountable for meeting and constantly improving sustainability goals.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Executive compensation: Introducing bonus schemes that reward executives for meeting non-financial performance goals including safety targets, greenhouse gas emissions, reduction targets, and goals engaging stakeholders to help shape the companies public policy positions. Companies such as Exelon have implemented policies like this.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Stakeholder Engagement: Other companies will keep sustainability within its strategy and goals, presenting findings at shareholder meetings, and actively tracking metrics on sustainability. Companies such as PepsiCo, Heineken, and FIFCO{{clarify|What is FIFCO? Please also replace this jargon acronym with the full term the other times it appears in the article|date=April 2018}} take steps in this direction to implement sustainability initiatives. (Best Practices). Companies such as Coca-Cola have actively tried improve their efficiency of water usage, hiring 3rd party auditors to evaluate their water management approach. FIFCO has also led successfully led water-management initiatives.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Employee Engagement: Implementation of sustainability projects through directly appealing to employees (typically through the human resource department) is another option for companies to implement sustainability. This involves integrating sustainability into the company culture, with hiring practices and employee training. General Electric is a company that is taking the lead in implementing initiatives in this manner. Bank of America directly engaged employees by implement LEED (leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings, with a fifth of its building meeting these certifications.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Supply chain management: Establishing requirements for not only internal operations but also first-tier suppliers as well as second-tier suppliers to help drive environmental and social expectations further down the supply chain. Companies such as Starbucks, FIFCO and Ford Motor Company have implemented requirements that suppliers must meet to win their business. Starbucks has led efforts in engaging suppliers and local communities where they operate to accelerate investment in sustainable farming. Starbucks set a goal of ethically sourcing 100% of its coffee beans by 2015.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

Releasing Studies, Insights, Best Practices and Findings: By revealing decision making data about how sustainability was reached, companies are giving away insights that can help others across the industry and beyond make more sustainable decisions. Nike launched its “making app” in 2013 which released data about the sustainability in the materials it was using. This ultimately allows other companies to make more sustainable design decisions and create lower impact products.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

==Academic discipline==
As an academic discipline, business ethics emerged in the 1970s. Since no academic business ethics journals or conferences existed, researchers published in general management journals, and attended general conferences. Over time, specialized peer-reviewed journals appeared, and more researchers entered the field. Corporate scandals in the earlier 2000s increased the field's popularity. As of 2009, sixteen academic journals devoted to various business ethics issues existed, with [[Journal of Business Ethics]] and [[Business Ethics Quarterly]] considered the leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1504/IJBGE.2009.023790|accessdate=2009-10-21|url=http://www.aserenko.com/papers/IJBGE040405_PUBLISHED.pdf|author1=Serenko, A.|author2=Bontis, N.|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2009|title=A citation-based ranking of the business ethics scholarly journals|journal=International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics|volume=4|issue=4|pages=390–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The International Business Development Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdinstitute.org|title=IBD Institute|publisher=IBD Institute|accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a global non-profit organization that represents 217 nations and all 50 United States. It offers a Charter in Business Development that focuses on ethical business practices and standards. The Charter is directed by [[Harvard]], [[MIT]], and [[Fulbright]] Scholars, and it includes graduate-level coursework in economics, politics, marketing, management, technology, and legal aspects of business development as it pertains to business ethics. IBDI also oversees the International Business Development Institute of Asia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibdinstitute.asia {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706090723/http://www.ibdinstitute.asia/|date=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides individuals living in 20 Asian nations the opportunity to earn the Charter.

==Religious views==
In [[Sharia]] law, followed by many [[Muslims]], [[Islamic banking|banking]] specifically prohibits charging interest on loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1047142445698534480|title=For Devout Muslims, Interest Is Forbidden|last=Journal|first=Alex Frangos Staff Reporter of The Wall Street|date=2003-03-09|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[Confucian]] thought discourages profit-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Chan{{cite web|url=http://www.stthom.edu/academics/centers/cbes/jonachan.html|title=Confucian Business Ethics and the Nature of Business Decisions|accessdate=2006-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427023145/http://www.stthom.edu/academics/centers/cbes/jonachan.html |archivedate=2006-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] offers the [[Golden Rule]] command, "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|7:12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the article "Theory of the real economy", there is a more narrow point of view from the Christianity faith towards the relationship between ethics and religious traditions. This article stresses about how Christianity is capable of establishing reliable boundaries for financial institutions. One criticism comes from Pope Benedict by describing the "damaging effects of the real economy of badly managed and largely speculative financial dealing." It is mentioned that Christianity has the potential to transform the nature of finance and investment but only if theologians and ethicist provide more evidence of what is real in the economic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mcdaniel|first=Charles|title="Theology of the "Real Economy"|journal=Journal of religion and business ethics|year=2011|volume=2|url=http://via.library.depaul.edu/jrbe/vol2/iss2/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business ethics receives an extensive treatment in Jewish thought and [[Rabbinic literature]], both from an ethical (''[[Musar movement|Mussar]]'') and a legal (''[[Halakha]]'') perspective; see article ''[[Jewish business ethics]]'' for further discussion.
According to the article "Indian Philosophy and Business Ethics: A Review", by Chandrani Chattopadyay, Hindus follow "Dharma" as Business Ethics and unethical business practices are termed "Adharma".  Business men are supposed to maintain steady-mindedness, self-purification, non-violence, concentration, charity and control over senses. Books like Bhagavat Gita&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/AMAE/Vol%202_3_8.pdf|title=Indian Philosophy and Business Ethics: A Review|author=Chattopadhyay, Chandrani|journal=Advances in Management &amp; Applied Economics|publisher=Science Ltd.|volume=2|number=3|year=2012|pages=111–123|issn=1792-7544}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arthashastra&lt;ref&gt;“Two Birds in a Tree: Timeless Indian Wisdom for Business Leaders,” by Ram Nidumolu (Berrett-Koehler, 2013), Chapter 4: The Higher Reality of Business&lt;/ref&gt; contribute a lot towards conduct of ethical business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandhill.com/article/four-stages-of-business-evolution-through-the-lens-of-ancient-indian-wisdom/|title=Four Stages of Business Evolution through the Lens of Ancient Indian Wisdom|date=February 19, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related disciplines==
[[Business]] ethics is part of the [[Philosophy of Economics|philosophy of economics]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that deals with the philosophical, political, and [[ethics|ethical]] underpinnings of business and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christoph Luetge]] (ed.): Handbook of the Philosophical Foundations of Business Ethics. Heidelberg/New York: Springer 2013, {{ISBN|978-9400714953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Business ethics operates on the premise, for example, that the ethical operation of a private business is possible—those who dispute that premise, such as [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], (who contend that "business ethics" is an [[oxymoron]]) do so by definition outside of the domain of business ethics proper.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The philosophy of economics also deals with questions such as what, if any, are the [[social responsibility|social responsibilities]] of a business; [[business management]] [[theory]]; theories of [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]]; [[free will]] among participants in the [[marketplace]]; the role of [[selfishness|self interest]]; [[invisible hand]] theories; the requirements of [[social justice]]; and [[natural rights]], especially [[property rights]], in relation to the business enterprise.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Business ethics is also related to [[political economy]], which is [[economic analysis]] from political and [[economic history|historical]] perspectives. Political economy deals with the distributive consequences of economic actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14934">'''Context analysis''' is a method to analyze the environment in which a business operates. [[Environmental scanning]] mainly focuses on the macro environment of a business. But context analysis considers the entire environment of a business, its internal and external environment. This is an important aspect of [[business plan]]ning. One kind of context analysis, called [[SWOT analysis]], allows the business to gain an insight into their strengths and weaknesses and also the opportunities and threats posed by the market within which they operate. The main goal of a context analysis, SWOT or otherwise, is to analyze the environment in order to develop a strategic plan of action for the business.

Context analysis also refers to a method of sociological analysis associated with Scheflen (1963) which believes that 'a given act, be it a glance at [another] person, a shift in posture, or a remark about the weather, has no intrinsic meaning. Such acts can only be understood when taken in relation to one another.' (Kendon, 1990: 16). This is not discussed here; only Context Analysis in the business sense is.

== Define market or subject ==

The first step of the method is to define a particular market (or subject) one wishes to analyze and focus all analysis techniques on what was defined.  A subject, for example, can be a newly proposed product idea.1

== Trend Analysis ==

The next step of the method is to conduct a trend analysis. Trend analysis is an analysis of macro environmental factors in the external environment of a business, also called [[PEST analysis]]. It consists of analyzing political, economical, social, technological and demographic trends. This can be done by first determining which factors, on each level, are relevant for the chosen subject and to score each item as to specify its importance. This allows the business to identify those factors that can influence them. They can’t control these factors but they can try to cope with them by adapting themselves. The trends (factors) that are addressed in [[PEST analysis]] are Political, Economical, Social and Technological; but for context analysis Demographic trends are also of importance. Demographic trends are those factors that have to do with the population, like for example average age, religion, education etc. Demographic information is of importance if, for example during [[market research]], a business wants to determine a particular market segment to target. The other trends are described in [[environmental scanning]] and [[PEST analysis]]. Trend analysis only covers part of the external environment. Another important aspect of the external environment that a business should consider is its competition. This is the next step of the method, competitor analysis.

== Competitor Analysis ==

As one can imagine, it is important for a business to know who its competition is, how they do their business and how powerful they are so that they can be on the defense and offense. In [[Competitor analysis]] a couple of techniques are introduced how to conduct such an analysis. Here I will introduce another technique which involves conducting four sub analyses, namely: determination of competition levels, competitive forces, competitor behavior and competitor strategy. 

===Competition levels===
Businesses compete on several levels and it is important for them to analyze these levels so that they can understand the demand. Competition is identified on four levels:
*'''Consumer needs''': level of competition that refers to the needs and desires of consumers. A business should ask: What are the desires of the consumers?
*'''General competition''': The kind of consumer demand. For example: do consumers prefer shaving with electric razor or a razor blade?
*'''Brand''': This level refers to brand competition. Which brands are preferable to a consumer?
*'''Product''': This level refers to the type of demand. Thus what types of products do consumers prefer?
Another important aspect of a competition analysis is to increase the [[consumer]] insight. For example: [Ducati] has, by interviewing a lot of their customers, concluded that their main competitor is not another bicycle, but sport-cars like [Porsche] or [GM]. This will of course influence the competition level within this business.

===Competitive forces===
These are forces that determine the level of competition within a particular market. There are six forces that have to be taken into consideration, power of the competition, threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, threat of substitute products and the importance of complementary products. This analysis is described in [[Porter 5 forces analysis]].
===Competitor behavior===
Competitor behaviors are the defensive and offensive actions of the competition.

===Competitor strategy===
These strategies refer to how an organization competes with other organizations. And these are: low price strategy and [[product differentiation]] strategy.

==Opportunities and Threats==
The next step, after the trend analysis and competitor analysis are conducted, is to determine threats and opportunities posed by the market. The trends analysis revealed a set of trends that can influence the business in either a positive or a negative manner. These can thus be classified as either opportunities or threats. Likewise, the competitor analysis revealed positive and negative competition issues that can be classified as opportunities or threats.
==Organization Analysis==
The last phase of the method is an analysis of the internal environment of the organization, thus the organization itself. The aim is to determine which skills, knowledge and technological fortes the business possesses. This entails conducting an internal analysis and a competence analysis.

===Internal analysis===
The internal analysis, also called [[SWOT analysis]], involves identifying the organizations strengths and weaknesses. The strengths refer to factors that can result in a market advantage and weaknesses to factors that give a disadvantage because the business is unable to comply with the market needs. 
===Competence analysis===
Competences are the combination of a business’ knowledge, skills and technology that can give them the edge versus the competition. Conducting such an analysis involves identifying market related competences, integrity related competences and functional related competences.

==SWOT-i matrix==
The previous sections described the major steps involved in context analysis. All these steps resulted in data that can be used for developing a strategy. These are summarized in a SWOT-i matrix. The trend and competitor analysis revealed the opportunities and threats posed by the market. The organization analysis revealed the competences of the organization and also its strengths and weaknesses. These strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats summarize the entire context analysis. A SWOT-i matrix, depicted in the table below, is used to depict these and to help visualize the strategies that are to be devised. SWOT- i stand for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats and Issues. The Issues refer to strategic issues that will be used to devise a strategic plan. 

{| border
|-
!
! Opportunities (O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
! Threats (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
|- valign="top"
! Strengths (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;...S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;...S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
|- valign="top"
! Weaknesses (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)
| W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;...W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
| W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;...W&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

This matrix combines the strengths with the opportunities and threats, and the weaknesses with the opportunities and threats that were identified during the analysis. Thus the matrix reveals four clusters:
*'''Cluster strengths and opportunities''': use strengths to take advantage of opportunities.
*'''Cluster strengths and threats''': use strengths to overcome the threats
*'''Cluster weaknesses and opportunities''': certain weaknesses hamper the organization from taking advantage of opportunities therefore they have to look for a way to turn those weaknesses around.
*'''Cluster weaknesses and threats''': there is no way that the organization can overcome the threats without having to make major changes.

==Strategic Plan==
The ultimate goal of context analysis is to develop a strategic plan. The previous sections described all the steps that form the stepping stones to developing a strategic plan of action for the organization .The trend and competitor analysis gives insight to the opportunities and threats in the market and the internal analysis gives insight to the competences of the organization. And these were combined in the SWOT-i matrix. The SWOT-i matrix helps identify issues that need to be dealt with. These issues need to be resolved by formulating an objective and a plan to reach that objective, a strategy.

==Example==
Joe Arden is in the process of writing a business plan for his business idea, Arden Systems. Arden Systems will be a software business that focuses on the development of software for small businesses. Joe realizes that this is a tough market because there are many software companies that develop business software. Therefore, he conducts context analysis to gain insight into the environment of the business in order to develop a strategic plan of action to achieve competitive advantage within the market.

===Define market===
First step is to [[#Define market or subject|define a market]] for analysis. Joe decides that he wants to focus on small businesses consisting of at most 20 employees.
===Trend Analysis===
Next step is to conduct [[#Trend Analysis|trend analysis]]. The macro environmental factors that Joe should take into consideration are as follows:
*'''''Political trend''''': Intellectual property rights
*'''''Economical trend''''': Economic growth
*'''''Social trend''''': Reduce operational costs; Ease for conducting business administration
*'''''Technological trend''''': Software suites; Web applications
*'''''Demographic trend''''': Increase in the graduates of IT related studies

===Competitor Analysis===
Following trend analysis is [[#Competitor Analysis|competitor analysis]]. Joe analyzes the competition on four levels to gain insight into how they operate and where advantages lie.
*'''''Competition level''''': 
**'''Consumer need''': Arden Systems will be competing on the fact that consumers want efficient and effective conducting of a business
**'''Brand''': There are software businesses that have been making business software for a while and thus have become very popular in the market. Competing based on brand will be difficult.
**'''Product''': They will be packaged software like the major competition.
*'''''Competitive forces''''': Forces that can affect Arden Systems are in particular:
**'''''The bargaining power of buyers''''': the extent to which they can switch from one product to the other.
**'''''Threat of new entrants''''': it is very easy for someone to develop a new software product that can be better than Arden's.
**'''''Power of competition''''': the market leaders have most of the cash and customers; they have to power to mold the market.
*'''''Competitor behavior''''': The focus of the competition is to take over the position of the market leader. 
*'''''Competitor strategy''''': Joe intends to compete based on product differentiation.

===Opportunities and Threats===
Now that Joe has analyzed the competition and the trends in the market he can define [[#Opportunities and Threats|opportunities and threats]]. 
*'''''Opportunities''''':
**Because the competitors focus on taking over the leadership position, Arden can focus on those segments of the market that the market leader ignores. This allows them to take over where the market leader shows weakness.
**The fact that there are new IT graduates, Arden can employ or partner with someone that may have a brilliant idea.
*'''''Threats''''':
**IT graduates with fresh idea's can start their own software businesses and form a major competition for Arden Systems.
===Organization analysis===
After Joe has identified the opportunities and threats of the market he can try to figure out what Arden System's strengths and weaknesses are by doing an [[#Organization Analysis|organization analysis]].
*'''''Internal analysis''''': 
**Strength: Product differentiation
**Weakness: Lacks innovative people within the organization
*'''''Competence analysis''''': 
**Functional related competence: Arden Systems provides system functionalities that fit small businesses.
**Market-related competence: Arden Systems has the opportunity to focus on a part of the market which is ignored.

===SWOT-i matrix===
After the previous analyses, Joe can create a SWOT-i matrix to perform [[SWOT analysis]].
{| border
|-
! || Opportunities || Threats
|-
! Strengths 
| Product differentiation, market leader ignores market segment ||
|-
! Weaknesses 
| || Lack of innovation, increase in IT graduates
|}

===Strategic Plan===
After creating the SWOT-i matrix, Joe is now able to devise a [[#Strategic Plan|strategic plan]].
*Focus all software development efforts to that part of the market which is ignored by market leaders, small businesses.
*Employ recent innovative It graduates to stimulate the innovation within Arden Systems.

In  [[accounting]], the '''convention of conservatism''', also known as the '''doctrine of prudence''', is a policy of anticipating possible future losses but not future gains. This policy tends to understate rather than overstate net assets and net income, and therefore lead companies to . When given a choice between several outcomes where the probabilities of occurrence are equally likely, you should recognize that transaction resulting in the lower amount of profit, or at least the deferral of a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/14/the-conservatism-principle}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref name="Ahmed2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naseem Ahmed|title=Financial Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmiXKF8dRcIC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0993-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In accounting, it states that when choosing between two solutions, the one that will be least likely to overstate assets and income should be selected. Essentially, "expected losses are losses but expected gains are not gains".

The conservatism principle is the foundation for the lower of cost or market rule, which states that you should record inventory at the lower of either its acquisition cost or its current market value.

Conservatism plays an important role in a number of accounting rules, including the allowance for [[doubtful debt]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Scott B.|last2=Liu|first2=Xiaotao (kelvin)|date=2010-06-01|title=The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, Conservatism, and Earnings Management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00364.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=565–601|doi=10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00364.x|issn=1475-679X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[lower of cost or market]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountingcoach.com/lower-of-cost-or-market/explanation|title=Lower of Cost or Market (LCM) {{!}} Explanation {{!}} AccountingCoach|website=AccountingCoach.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporate development''' refers to the planning and execution of strategies to meet organizational objectives. The kinds of activities falling under corporate development may include management team recruitment, phasing in or out of markets or products, arranging strategic alliances, identifying and acquiring companies ([[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]]), securing [[Corporate finance|corporate financing]], [[Divestment|divesting of assets or divisions]], and management of intellectual property. The activities encompassed are often the role of the [[CEO]]. 

==Process==

Corporate strategy depends on the circumstances of a company and the area where development is desired. Corporate development is usually a process that takes place over an extended period of time and may be adjusted or refined as the project moves forward

==Reshaping management==

One of the manifestations of corporate development has to do with reshaping the management arm of the corporation. This may involve a process of phasing certain management positions out of the existing structure or creating new positions in an effort to strengthen the management team. As part of this type of approach, corporate development may also demand that one or more current managers are released from the company and replaced with people who possess skills required to move the company forward. When this is the case, the corporate development team will handle the functions of recruitment and evaluation of potential hires.

==Growing the company==

The process of corporate development can also be applied to the task of growing the company through mergers and acquisitions. In this scenario, the project development will involve identifying potential target companies for acquisitions or unions resulting in a new and more aggressive corporation. The team will consider all possible outcomes from any given potential merger or acquisition and attempt to project if the action is likely to result in positive growth or could possibly impair the company permanently.

Just as a management team may be revamped, corporate development may also be employed to change the current focus for clients. This may mean looking into the potential for breaking into new markets with existing products or developing complementary products that will allow this type of expansion. Corporate development strategy would monitor the trends associated with a corporation's products or services and helps the corporation establish strategies to find more customers. In addition, corporate development works to maximize the profits of a corporation by figuring out the appropriate pricing for a given good or service. A corporate development team also leads discussions with sales department heads regarding how to market corporate goods, organize marketing campaigns, analyze market research and incorporate any customer advice or complaints into marketing strategies in such cases; extensive industry specific business experience is often preferred which is why companies may hire an external firm to help them engage in such moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Corporate_Development_Manager_Career_Profile.html |title=Corporate Development Manager Careers: Salary &amp; Job Description |publisher=Diplomaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the status of the base market, corporate development may also look at shifting away from a shrinking consumer market while seeking market share in a different consumer market with newer products. For example, many typewriter manufacturers during the 1980s and 1990s slowly phased out their core business and began to focus more on computer parts and accessories as a way to continue operations.

==Need for specialists==
Particularly in larger companies, corporate development is provided as a charter for a particular executive or team. In these cases, the opportunities and initiatives are numerous enough to justify specialists, instead of being delegated to the office of the CEO and line of business executives. When focused on product or financial issues, corporate development executives often have [[MBA]], [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] or [[Certified Practising Accountant|CPA]] credentials. Often the internal corporate development executives come from a legal or investment banking background, due to the complex contractual and valuation issues associated with many transactions.

[[File:Customs-House-Brisbane-2.jpg|thumb|250px|The Customs House in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''custom house''' or '''customs house''' was a building housing the offices for the government officials who processed the paperwork associated with importing and exporting goods into and out of a country.  Customs officials also collected [[customs (tax)|customs duty]] on imported goods.

The custom house was typically located in a [[seaport]] or in a city on a major river, with access to the ocean.  These cities acted as a [[port of entry]] into a country.  The government stationed officials at such locations to collect taxes and regulate commerce.

Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term "custom house" is now often an historical anachronism.  There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings.

In the [[United Kingdom]], since 1386, the phrase ''custom house'' has been in use over the term ''customs house''.  This was after a "[[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]]" was erected at Wool Wharf in [[Tower (ward)|Tower Ward]], to contain just the officials of the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.  The singular form was used even though in later years the Custom House was the location of other Customs officials as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Graham |date=1980|title=Something To Declare|page=6|publisher=Harrap &amp; Co.

'''Dashboards''' often provide at-a-glance views of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In the other, "dashboard" has another name for "progress report" or "report."

The "dashboard" is often displayed on a web page which is linked to a database that allows the report to be constantly updated. For example, a manufacturing dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. Similarly, a human resources dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment.&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targetdashboard.com/site/Dashboard-Best-Practice/Management-Report-and-Dashboard-best-practice-index.aspx|title=Management Reports &amp; Dashboard Best Practice|last=Briggs|first=Jonathan|publisher=Target Dashboard|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term dashboard originates from the [[automobile]] [[dashboard]] where drivers   monitor the major functions at a glance via the instrument cluster.

==Benefits==
Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a "snapshot" of performance.

Benefits of using digital dashboards include:&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;
*Visual presentation of performance measures
*Ability to identify and correct negative trends
*Measure efficiencies/inefficiencies
*Ability to generate detailed reports showing new trends
*Ability to make more informed decisions based on collected [[business intelligence]]
*Align strategies and organizational goals
*Saves time compared to running multiple reports
*Gain total visibility of all systems instantly
*Quick identification of data outliers and correlations

==Classification==
Dashboards can be broken down according to role and are either [[strategic]], analytical, operational, or informational.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic dashboards support managers at any level in an organization, and provide the quick overview that decision makers need to monitor the health and opportunities of the business. Dashboards of this type focus on high level measures of performance, and forecasts. Strategic dashboards benefit from static snapshots of data (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) that are not constantly changing from one moment to the next. Dashboards for analytical purposes often include more context, comparisons, and history, along with subtler performance evaluators. Analytical dashboards typically support interactions with the data, such as drilling down into the underlying details. Dashboards for monitoring operations are often designed differently from those that support strategic decision making or data analysis and often require monitoring of activities and events that are constantly changing and might require attention and response at a moment's notice.

==Types of dashboards==

Digital dashboards may be laid out to track the flows inherent in the business processes that they monitor. Graphically, users may see the high-level processes and then [[data drilling|drill down]] into low level data. This level of detail is often buried deep within the corporate enterprise and otherwise unavailable to the senior executives.

Three main types of digital dashboard dominate the market today: stand alone software applications, web-browser based applications, and desktop applications also known as [[desktop widgets]]. The last are driven by a [[Software widget|widget engine]].

Specialized dashboards may track all corporate functions. Examples include [[human resources]], [[Recruitment|recruiting]], [[sales]], [[Business operations|operations]], [[security]], [[information technology]], [[project management]], [[customer relationship management]] and many more departmental dashboards. For a smaller organization like a startup a compact startup scorecard dashboard tracks important activities across lot of domains ranging from social media to sales.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Digital dashboard projects involve business units as the driver and the information technology department as the enabler. The success of digital dashboard projects often depends on the [[measurement|metrics]] that were chosen for monitoring. [[Key performance indicator]]s, [[balanced scorecard]]s, and sales performance figures are some of the content appropriate on business dashboards.

==Dashboards and scoreboards==
Balanced Scoreboards and Dashboards have been linked together as if they were interchangeable. However, although both visually display critical information, the difference is in the format: Scoreboards can open the quality of an operation while dashboards provide calculated direction. 
A balanced scoreboard has what they called a "prescriptive" format. It should always contain these components (Active Strategy)...
*Perspectives – group
*Objectives – verb-noun phrases pulled from a strategy plan
*Measures – also called Metric or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Spotlight Indicators – red, yellow, or green symbols that provide an at-a-glance view of a measure’s performance.
Each of these sections ensures that a Balanced Scorecard is essentially connected to the businesses critical strategic needs.

The design of a dashboard is more loosely defined.  Dashboards are usually a series of graphics, charts, gauges and other visual indicators that can be monitored and interpreted.  Even when there is a strategic link, on a dashboard, it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards.  However, dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;ZSL Inc., ''Dashboards Vs Scorecards – An Insight'' ZSL Inc. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Digital dashboard technology is available "out-of-the-box" from many software providers. Some companies however continue to do in-house development and maintenance of dashboard applications. For example, [[GE Aviation]] has developed a proprietary software/portal called "Digital Cockpit" to monitor the trends in aircraft spare parts business.

Good dashboard design practices take into account and address the following:

* the medium it is designed for (desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet)
* use of visuals over tabluar presentation of data
** bar charts: to visualize one or more series of data
** line charts: to track changes in a number of dependent data sets over a period of time
** sparklines: to show the trend in a single data set
* use of legends anytime more than one color or shape is present on a graph
* spatial arrangement: place your most important view on the top left (if the language is written left to right) then arrange the following views in a Z pattern with the most important information following the top-to-bottom, left-to-right pattern&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Firican|first=George|date=May 22, 2017|title=Best Practices for Powerful Dashboards|url=https://tdwi.org/research/2017/05/business-intelligence-journal-vol-22-no-2.aspx|journal=Business Intelligence Journal|volume=22|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* color palettes to be colorblind friendly 

A good information design will clearly communicate key information to users and makes supporting information easily accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey Barr, ''7 Small Business Dashboard Design Dos and Don'ts'' (Barr, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the quality of dashboards==
There are a few key elements to a good dashboard:.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Hetherington, ''Dashboard Demystified: What is a Dashboard?'' (Hetherington, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simple, communicates easily
# Minimum distractions...it could cause confusion
# Supports organized business with meaning and useful data
# Applies human visual perception to visual presentation of information
# It can be accessed easily by its intended audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/white-paper-on-best-practices-for-powerful-dashboards/|title=White Paper: Best practices for powerful dashboards|last=|first=|date=May 29, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea of digital dashboards followed the study of [[decision support system]]s in the 1970s. Early predecessors of the modern business dashboard were first developed in the 1980s in the form of [[Executive Information Systems]] (EISs). Due to problems primarily with data refreshing and handling, it was soon realized that the approach wasn’t practical as information was often incomplete, unreliable, and spread across too many disparate sources.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Few, ''Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data'' (O'Reilly, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, EISs hibernated until the 1990s when the information age quickened pace and data warehousing, and [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) allowed dashboards to function adequately.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Despite the availability of enabling technologies, the dashboard use didn't become popular until later in that decade, with the rise of [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs), and the introduction of Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton's [[Balanced Scorecard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne W. Eckerson]], ''Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing Your Business'' (Wiley , 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, [[Microsoft]] promoted a concept known as the [[Digital Nervous System]] and "digital dashboards" were described as being one leg of that concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/News/Breaking-News/Microsoft-refines-Digital-Dashboard-concept--12189.aspx | title=Microsoft refines Digital Dashboard concept | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the use of dashboards forms an important part of Business Performance Management (BPM).

'''''Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto''''' written by [[Benedetto Cotrugli]] around 1400 was the first [[bookkeeping]] [[manuscript]] and trade manual.&lt;ref name="item 1441"&gt;[[#Anzovin|Anzovin, 2000]], p. 36, item 1441&lt;/ref&gt; The title has been translated in English by the alternate names of ''Of commerce and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="item 1441"/&gt; ''On merchantry and the perfect merchant'',&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et22a1.html History of Croatian Science, 15th-19th centuries]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''On trade and the perfect dealer.''&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"&gt;[http://www.oxbridgewriters.com/essays/accounting/financial-accounting-accountants.php Essay title - Financial Accounting And Accountants]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several historians show that, since the manuscript was written in 1458, it is the oldest known manuscript on the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]], and, as such, predates [[Luca Pacioli]]'s book by at least 36 years.&lt;ref name="Zubrinic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Essay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AccountingHistory"&gt;[http://www.promonegocios.net/contabilidad/historia-contabilidad.html Accounting History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/siesc2.html SIESC 2007 in CROATIA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"&gt;''In Chapter XIII of the 1st book is called "order to keep " the records marketable '. There are only very vague rules, and the author observes: "..... narrating everything here wanting to '1 minute 'treatment would be too verbose et almost impossible to express it, "that without the living voice, writing can hardly be impa" rare. " However, one can easily argue that Benedict Cotrugli want to talk about the double entry. He says that the scriptures remind you credit, debt, cost of goods, profits and losses and any other cenda ago, adds that the merchant must hold the memorial, the newspaper, and the notebook with its own alphabet, which devesi entered in the log, what to do, the Whole capital and bring everything to your file. 'S work of the merchant Ragusin was not amended in the audience, Luca Pacioli is no longer the first exhibitor of record keeping.'' [[#Alfieri|Alfieri, 1891]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason why Luca Pacioli (1445–1517) received credit as the father of accounting is because Cotrugli's work was not officially published until 1573.&lt;ref&gt;[http://html.rincondelvago.com/evolucion-historica-de-la-contabilidad.html Historical evolution of accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paciolicode.com/ 3.

The first English translation of the Libro de l'arte de la mercatura (The Book of the Art of Trade) edited by Carlo Carraro and Giovanni Favero, with a foreword by Niall Ferguson, Professor of History at Harvard University, has been published by Palgrave Mcmillan in 2017, based on the critical edition of the original manuscripts made by Vera Ribaudo, University of Venice, published on May 2016 by Edizioni Cà Foscari, Venice. 

== Manuscript content ==
The manuscript contains four books. The first is of the origin, form, and essence of being a [[merchant]]. The second talks of a merchant's religious commitment. The third is of moral virtues and policies. The fourth is administration of his home and family, and his economic matters.&lt;ref name="Chapter XIII"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hangers|Hangers, 1803]], p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the manuscript merchandising was regarded as an art. The "Perfect Merchant" or "Perfect Dealer" was a man of culture motivated  
to good moral conduct and honest transactions to everyone he encountered. He had to be very sensitive to local interests in places where he conducted business. He had to know how to assess the political situation and the customary laws in order to successfully conduct his business. Kotruljević wrote in his bookkeeping and merchandising trade manual that not only must a merchant be a [[bookkeeper]]-[[accountant]], but that he must also be a good writer, a [[rhetorician]] and a [[Intellectual#Men of letters|man of letters]] being diplomatic all the while.&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;[http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/30/id/123/ Markets of the Mediterranean]&lt;/ref&gt;

He contrasted the "Perfect Merchant" to sailors and soldiers by saying that they were many times naive of these points. He said they were of such dull mind that when they would drink in a tavern and buy bread at a market they often had [[grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]] and were not very diplomatic.&lt;ref name="conduct"/&gt;

'''Direct store delivery''' (DSD) is a key method of selling and distributing products for a large variety of industries, such as [[food]], [[beverage]], home [[personal care]] products, and [[wholesale]] and distribution, [[oil]] &amp; [[gas]], service industries to name industries beyond consumer products.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/DSD_Final_111108.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

DSD is a business process that manufacturers use to both sell and distribute goods directly to [[point of sale]]s (PoS) or point of consumption (PoC) including additional product and market related services such as [[merchandising]], [[information gathering]], or equipment service and bypassing any [[retailer]] or wholesaler logistics. A company that performs DSD does not send goods to any locations using any independent third party actor – neither an independent wholesaler, nor the retailer‘s own warehouses.

DSD is an alternative distribution model to centralized distribution and tends to be used extensively in the food industry for fresh products such as milk and bread where minimizing the number of days in the supply chain is a key concern.  Similarly, DSD is used effectively for full truckload orders where bypassing distribution centers makes economic sense.  DSD is also a favored approach when there is a strong requirement for supplier knowledge or service such as is the case with greeting cards for example.  Having said this, there is pressure building up in the food supply chain to reduce the retailer's reliance on DSD and push more volume through centralized distribution channels.

The [[Standard Interchange Language]] (SIL) acts as an interface standard for transferring data between proprietary store systems like DSD and PoS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13909">'''Dynamic enterprise modeling''' (DEM) is an [[enterprise modeling]] approach developed by the [[Baan Corporation|Baan]] company, and used for the Baan [[enterprise resource planning]] system which aims "to align and implement it in the organizational architecture of the end-using company".&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Bidgoli (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Information Systems''. page 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Dieter Knoll et al. (2003). ''Optimising Business Performance with Standard Software Systems''. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Koning (2008), Baan introduced dynamic enterprise modelling in 1996 as a "means for implementing the Baan ERP product. The modelling focused on a [[Petri net]]–based technique for [[business process modelling]] to which the Baan application units were to be linked. DEM also contains a [[supply-chain]] diagram tool for the logistic network of the company and of an enterprise [[function model]]ling diagram".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Koning (2008). [http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/dissertations/2008-0908-200828/koning.pdf Communication of IT-Architecture]. Thesis Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems. {{ISBN|978-90-5335-163-5}}. p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
To align a specific company with dynamic enterprise modeling, the organizational structure is blueprinted top-down from high-level [[business process]]es to low-level processes. This blueprint is used as a roadmap of the organization, that is compatible with the structural roadmap of the software package. Having both roadmaps, the software package and the organizational structure are alienable. The blueprint of an [[organizational structure]] in dynamic enterprise modeling is called a [[reference model]]. A reference model is the total view of visions, functions, organizational structures and processes, which together can be defined as a representative way of doing business in a certain [[organizational typology]].

The DEM reference model consists of a set of underlying models that depict the organizational architecture in a top-down direction. The underlying models are:

* ''Enterprise structure diagrams'': The company site structure is visualized with the dispersed geographic locations, the headquarters, manufacturing plants, warehouses, and supplier and customer locations. Physical as well as logical multi-site organizations for internal logistic or financial flow optimization can be diagrammed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] (2001). [http://www.caise01.ethz.ch/tutorials/brinkkemper.html Business Modelling for the Development and Implementation of Enterprise Applications] (Abstract). Accessed Aug 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Business control model'' : The business control model represents the primary processes of the organization and their control, grouped in business functions. The DEM reference model exists of one main Business Control Model, resulting in several other Business Control Models per function area of the organization.
* ''Business function model'' : The business function model is a [[function model]] that focuses on the targets of the several functions within the company.
* ''Business process model'' : The business process model focuses on the execution of the functions and processes that originate from the business control model and the business function model. Processes flows are depicted and processes are detailed out.
* ''Business organization model'' : The business organization model focuses less on the processes and more on the organizational aspects such as roles and responsibilities.

Together these models are capable of depicting the total organizational structure and aspects that are necessary during the implementation of the dynamic enterprise modeling. The models can have differentiations, which are based on the typology of the organization (i.e.: engineer-to-order organizations require different model structures than assemble-to-order organizations. To elaborate on the way that the reference model is used to implement software and to keep track of the scope of implementation methods, the business control model and the business process model will be explained in detail.

=== Business control model ===
The business control model exists of the business functions of the organization and their internal and external links. Basic features in the model are:

* ''Request-feedback-loop'': A link from, to, or between business functions is called a request-feedback-loop, which consists of 4 states that complete the process and information flows between both business functions. The states are labeled: requested, committed, completed and accepted.
* ''Workflow case''. A workflow case is the description of the execution and the target of the process that occurs between two business functions. The most important critical factors of the workflow case are quantity, quality and time. The 4 states of Request-feedback-loop the together represent the workflow case.
* ''Triggers'': Business functions are aggregates of business processes and focus mainly on the triggers (control) between processes, thus not on the information flows.
* ''Business functions'' : In an optimal situation for the modeling process, a company has only one business function. Business functions are however subdivided when:
** The nature and characteristics of workflow cases fluctuate
** The frequency in underlying processes fluctuate
** Detail-level fluctuates
** More than 1 type of request triggers a function

Next to interaction between two business functions, interaction can also exist between objects that are not in the scope of the reference model. These objects can be external business functions and agents.

* ''External business function'' : this is a group of processes that are part of the organization (meaning that the organization can control the functions), but that is outside of the scope of the reference model.
Agents on the other hand are entities similar to business functions with the exception that they are external of the business (i.e.: customers and suppliers).
* Processes within or between business functions are executed by '''triggers''', which can be '''event-driven''' or '''time-driven'''.
* Exceptions in a system are handled, according to the set handling level in the business process configuration, when the success path of the model is not met in practice.
Subroutines of processes can be modeled in the Business Control Model to take care of possible exceptions that can occur during the execution of a process (i.e.: delay handling in the delivery of goods).

In addition to business functions that consist of the main processes of the organization,  management functions exist.
* ''Management business functions'': These are functions that manage the business process itself and that thus support the execution and triggering of the main business functions.

Having this reference, the main processes of the organization can be captured in the Business Control Model. The main functions of the organization are grouped in the business functions, which consist of the processes that are part of the specific business function. Interactions between the business functions are then depicted using the request-feedback loops.

=== Constructing the business control model ===
A business control model is constructed according to a set path.
* First, the '''scope''' of the business is defined. The scope includes scoping what to model and includes the definition of the agents and external business functions that relate to the business.
* Next, the scope is depicted to a model of the black box with al the agents and external business functions surrounding the black box.
* The next step is to define the process and information flows (request-feedback flows) between the agents and external business functions to and from the black box of the business control model. Defining the request-feedback flows enables the modeler to define what processes are inside the black box.

After creating the main business functions within the business control model, the several business functions are detailed out.
* In case of a production business it is vital to define the '''customer order decoupling point''', referring to the split in the physical process where processes are based on the customer order instead of forecasts.
* Service based businesses on the other hand do not have a physical goods flow and thus do not require a physical process model. It is however imaginable that the same type of process flow can be utilized to construct a business control model for a service based business, as a service can be interpreted as a product as well. In this way, a business control model can be constructed similarly for a service based business as for a physical goods production business, having intangible goods instead of tangible.
* Next to the low-level physical production process, the high-level business functions need to be defined as well. In most cases the higher level business functions relate to planning functions and other tactical and strategical business functions, followed by functions as sales and purchase.

After high-level detail definitions, the business functions are decomposed to lower-level detail definitions to make the business control model alienable to the lower models within the reference model, for this practice, mainly the Business Process Model. In the Business Process Model the processes are elaborated until the lowest level of detail. Given this level of detail, the Baan software functionality is then projected on the processes, depicted in the Business Process Model.

=== Business process model ===
The modeling of processes in DEM, modeling the business process model is done using ''[[Petri net]] building blocks''. DEM uses 4 construction elements:

* State : A state element represents the state of a job token and is followed by the activity that executes the job token of the state.
* Processing activity : A processing activity is the activity that processes the job token of a state, transforming the state of the job token to another state.
* Control activity: A control activity navigates the process activity but does not execute it.
* Subprocess : A subprocess is a collection of different other processes, aggregated in a single element by means of [[complexity management]].

These 4 construction elements enables the modeling of DEM models. The modeling is due to a set collection of modeling constraints, guiding the modeling process in order to have similarly created models by different modelers. Control activities exist in different structures in order to set different possible routes for process flows. The used structures for control activities are:

* OR-split / XOR-split : This structure creates 2 new states out of 1 state, signaling the creation of 2 job tokens out of 1 job token. If the new state can be both of the output tokens, the split is OR, if not, the split is an exclusive OR split (XOR).
* AND-join construction : 2 job tokens are both needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token (thus 1 new state).
* OR-join / XOR-join : 2 job tokens are needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token.
OR means one of the two starting job tokens can be used or both, XOR means only one of the tokens can be used to create the output job token.

=== An example ===
The example below demonstrates the modeling of the concept of marriage and divorce using Petri net building blocks. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DEM-Marriage.gif|300px]] --&gt;
* The Petri net built model expresses the transformation from a single man and woman to a married couple through marriage and back to single individuals through divorce.
* The model starts with the two states called man and woman.
* Through an AND-join construction (both man and woman are needed in order to form a couple) the two states are joined within the control activity called coupling to the new state called couple.
* The couple state then is transformed through the processing activity called marriage, resulting in the transformed state of married couple.
* The state married couple is then transformed to the state divorced couple using the process activity called divorce, resulting in the state called divorced couple.
* The control activity called decoupling finally splits the divorced couple state into the states of man and woman.

=== Assessments ===
Using an embedded method brings the power that the method is designed to implement the software product that the method comes with. This suggests a less complicated usage of the method and more support possibilities.
The negative aspect of an embedded method obviously is that it can only be used for specific product software. Engineers and consultants, operating with several software products, could have more use of a general method, to have just one way of working.

'''Ecoprenuership''', also known as '''Green Entrepreneurship''', not to be mistaken for “[[Sustainable Business]]” or “[[Green Business]]” is most simply referred to as the development of enterprise through entrepreneurship while incorporating an environmentally responsible perspective into the operations and goals of the entrepreneur. Ecopreneurship is also a term coined to represent the process of principles of entrepreneurship being applied to create businesses that solve environmental problems or operate sustainably.

==History and Development of Ecoprenuership==
Literature began being published on Ecoprenuership in the early 1990s with the introduction of ''Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecoprenuership'' by Gwynn Schuyler (Schuyler. 1998). Schuyler offers a simple yet unprecedented definition of Ecoprenuership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecopreneurship|last=Schuyler|first=Gwen|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Schuyler's definition in 1998 the definition of Ecopreuership has developed and concepts defining the term have changed. David Kainrath of the Umea School of Business has defined Ecoprenuership as the convergence of three main concepts, including:
# Eco-innovation
# Eco-opportunity
# Eco- commitment
Furthermore, Kainrath states that an Ecoprenuerial Company is "a company in which the three Ecoprenuership Concepts manifest."

== Systems thinking ==
Systems Thinking is a core principle to any business concerned with sustainability and the environment. It is an approach to problem solving that studies how something interacts with its environment as a whole, whether that be social, economic or natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinking.net/Systems_Thinking/Intro_to_ST/intro_to_st.html|title=Intro to Systems Thinking|last=Aronson|first=Dan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to a linear thinking model, which would isolate a problem and study only its directly related processes to find solutions. It consists of the notion that in order to understand vertical problems (looking deeply at one particular issue), you must understand and evaluate the horizontal environment as a whole (the entire system and its interrelated functions). As it pertains to business is best illustrated in the book ''Entrepreneurship and Sustainability'' by Andrea Larsen,&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Systems thinking applied to new ventures reminds us that companies operate in complex sets of interlocking living and non-living, including markets and supply chains as well as non-living systems.... Taking a systems perspective reminds us that we are accustomed to thinking of business in terms of discrete units with clear boundaries between them. We forget that these boundaries exist primarily in our minds or as legal constructs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Strategy and the Environment|last=Larson|first=Andrea|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=304–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Product Design==
[[Product design]] incorporating sustainability can happen at any stage of the business, including material extraction, [[logistics]], the manufacturing process, disposal, etc. Sustainable product design can be achieved using innovative technology (or Eco-innovation), cradle to cradle design, [[Biomimetics|bio-mimicry]], etc. In a description by the government of Canada's department on Innovation, Science and Economic Development, sustainable product design is further explained:

"Product design offers the opportunity to incorporate green and socially responsible attributes into a product. Referred to as Design for Sustainability (D4S), it is a process that addresses environmental and social considerations in the earliest stages of the product development process to minimize negative environmental and social impacts throughout the product's life cycle and to comply with the principles of economic, social and ecological sustainability.

Sustainable product design can encompass the selection of materials, use of resources, production requirements and planning for the final disposition (recycling, reuse, remanufacturing, or disposal) of a product. It takes into account the socio-economic circumstances of the company and the opportunity for the firm to address social problems associated with poverty, safety, inequity, health and the working environment. It is not a stand-alone methodology but one that must be integrated with a company's existing product design so that environmental and social parameters can be integrated with traditional product attributes such as quality, cost, and functionality."

==Innovative Technology==
Companies practicing ecopreneurship aim to solve environmental issues by developing new technology or innovating existing technologies. Within the past five years modern society has witnessed development of precedent setting technologies such as long range electric vehicles as well as the improvement though innovation of existing technologies such as solar panels. Examples of innovation backed by an environmentally responsible attitude has inspired a new class of entrepreneurs who identify as Ecoprenuers.

The development of innovative technologies has developed an opportunity for Ecoprenuers to apply technology to sustainable or green businesses. Cosmin Nacu and Silvia Avasilcai state that "this trend has created a full range of opportunities for entrepreneurs: from creating green-technology, using technology to promote environmental sustainability (e.g. energy management) to simply make the existing business more environmentally friendly to take advantage of the benefits" (Source). The development of new and innovative technologies are complimentary to the development of green enterprises and enable Ecoprenuers to continue developing enterprise that are environmentally sustainable.

==Cradle to cradle Design==
[[Cradle-to-cradle design]] is a popular environmental approach to product design that seeks to eliminate waste by designing products that can be continuously recirculated through our economy. This is contrasted against a "cradle to grave" design which typically includes single use products or products made of multiple different materials that cannot be separated in order to be recycled properly.[5] Cradle to Cradle design is mimicked after processes in the natural environment which do not create waste but instead every output is an input for another organism. Cradle to Cradle design is often achieved through using environmentally friendly resources (non-toxic) that can either be recycled into other products or composted. Another important component of cradle to cradle design is the ability to easily take products apart for better reuse as well as designing with durability in mind. This idea was popularized by the 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' written by William McDonough and Michael Braungart.

==Challenges and Opportunities==
The Sustainable Business Industry is one of the biggest opportunities in commerce in the past 20 years according to Thierry Volery, author of Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volery|first1=Thiery|title=Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/T_Volery/publication/36387113_Ecopreneurship_rationale_current_issues_and_futures_challenges/links/54b3e67a0cf2318f0f9697fb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, there continues to be a trend of challenges that Ecoprenuers face when developing their enterprise. "Ecology and economy have often been seen as conflicting, because the prevailing view is that there is an inherent and fixed trade-off between the two" and Ecoprenuers are constantly subjected to higher prices of operation that are inherit to operating in an environmentally sustainable way Rationale, current issues and futures challenges|url. The fact that Ecoprenuers aim to sustain "public goods" such as air, oceans, topsoil and wild species develops a challenge of measuring the use and value of these goods. Volery, author of '''Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges''' states  "it will never be profitable to  produce public goods privately, because the producer who incurs the cost of production cannot prevent the consumer from using the good freely" because public goods are non-excludable in consumption meaning that citizens cannot stop consuming certain public goods such as water or air.

Opportunities to develop sustainable business through Ecoprenuership represent a huge opportunity to take advantage of business practices of the future. Companies leading the way in sustainable business practices are taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015.[44] Since environmental concerns have become pressing many profitable opportunities have arisen. Government backed grants often lay the foundation for Ecoprenuers to take advantage of a quickly growing industry while being able to kickstart their endeavors with government money.

[[Triple bottom line]] Accounting is an accounting method that combines traditional [[accounting]] methods of measuring profit with those that measure social and environmental benefits as well. The phrase was created by John Elkington in 1994 at his company [http://www.sustainability.com/company SustainAbility]. Some criticisms have sprung up over what methods are to be used to measure environmental and social impacts.

== Legal forms ==
Ecopreneurs may decide to develop their company under traditional business legal forms like a [[sole proprietorship]] or an [[Limited liability company|LLC]] or they might chose some newer forms discussed below. These business forms are popular among the environmentally conscious community for their emphasis on social benefit.
* [[Low-profit limited liability company]] or (L3C) is a company that follows the same legal and tax codes as a traditional LLC but has a main goal of increasing social welfare like that of a non-profit organization.  This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013.
* [[Benefit corporation]] is for-profit legal entity that differs in its purpose and accountability from that of a regular corporation. Its emphasis on mission-driven purpose allows it a different accountability to stakeholders. This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013. More information can be found on the official website benefitcorp.net [http://benefitcorp.net/]

'''Empire-building''' is the practice of attempting to obtain greater power and authority within an organization for the purposes of [[Boasting|self-aggrandizement]], particularly by having extra staff or subordinates.&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/empire-building |title=empire-building |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Encarta Dictionaries: English dictionary: empire-building |url= |location=Redmond, WA |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |page= |date=2008 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In [[political science]], empire-building refers to the tendency of countries and nations to acquire resources, land, and economic influence outside their borders in order to expand their size, power, and wealth. This expansion can be at the cost of those nations or people that have had resources taken away from them so that the conqueror can be enriched.

In [[business]], empire-building is demonstrated when individuals or small groups attempt to gain control over key projects and initiatives to maximize [[job security]] and promotability. Project leadership hoards potential credit and prestige the project can produce. Because this approach prevents other people in the organization from contributing in a meaningful manner and alternative or competing projects to address the project's goals are destroyed regardless of their merit, the company suffers as a whole, projects fail, and the goals of the project are achieved partially, inadequately, or not at all. This sort of behavior is supposed to be stopped by upper management but is nevertheless very common.

In an organization, empire-building can also be demonstrated when an individual or small group eagerly and proactively suggests and pursues functions, activities or projects that are of questionable value to try to enhance legitimacy and future value. Pursuit of these activities is initially done at little or no marginal cost, but later the activities are used to justify increased resource allocation, being part of the organizational status quo, and thus the individual or group's overall command of resources, and influence, increases.

'''Engineering Economics in Civil Engineering''', also known generally as [[engineering economics]], or alternatively [[engineering economy]], is a subset of [[economics]], more specifically, [[microeconomics]]. It is defined as a "guide for the economic selection among technically feasible alternatives for the purpose of a rational allocation of scarce resources." &lt;ref name="Lesser1969"&gt;Lesser Jr, Arthur. "Engineering economy in the United States in retrospect—An analysis." The Engineering Economist 14.2 (1969): 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its goal is to guide entities, private or public that are confronted with the [[Economic problem|fundamental problem of economics]], it wishes to accomplish more than its resources will permit. &lt;ref name="Hoffer1998"&gt;Hoffer, Stefan N. Economic analysis of investment and regulatory decisions: revised guide. 1998. Accessed at [https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/policy_guidance/benefit_cost/media/ECONOMIC.pdf] {{PD-notice}} &lt;/ref&gt;
This fundamental problem of economics consists of two fundamental questions that must be answered, namely what objectives should be investigated or explored and how should these be achieved?  Economics as a social science answers those questions and is defined as the knowledge used for selecting among “…technically feasible alternatives for the purpose of a rational allocation of scarce resources.” &lt;ref name="Lesser1969"&gt;Lesser Jr, Arthur. "Engineering economy in the United States in retrospect—An analysis." The Engineering Economist 14.2 (1969): 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, all problems involving "...profit maximizing or cost-minimizing are engineering problems with economic objectives
and are properly described by the label "engineering economy".&lt;ref name="Goetz1959"&gt;Billy E.  (1959) Engineering Economy—Teaching and Practice, The Engineering Economist, 5:2, 1-12, DOI: 10.1080/00137915908965083 Access at [https://doi.org/10.1080/00137915908965083]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a subdiscipline practiced by [[civil engineers]], engineering economics narrows the definition of the fundamental economic problem and related questions to that of problems related to the [[Capital (economics)|investment of capital]], public or private in a broad array of [[Infrastructure_and_economics#Planning_and_management_of_infrastructure|infrastructure projects]]. Civil engineers confront more specialized forms of the fundamental problem in the form of inadequate economic evaluation of engineering projects.
&lt;ref name="Magyar1968"&gt;Magyar, William B. "Economic Evaluation of Engineering Projects." The Engineering Economist 13.2 (1968): 67-86.&lt;/ref&gt;
Civil engineers under constant pressure to deliver infrastructure effectively and efficiently confront complex problems associated with allocating scarce resources for ensuring [[ISO 10006|quality]], [[Risk_management#Risk_options|mitigating risk]] and [[Project delivery method|controlling project delivery]]. Civil engineers must be educated to recognize the role played by engineering economics as part of the [[Infrastructure_and_economics#Economic,_social_and_environmental_impacts_of_infrastructure|evaluations]] occurring at each phase in the project lifecycle.&lt;ref name="Magyar1968"/&gt;      

Thus, the application of engineering economics in the practice of civil engineering focuses on the decision-making process, its context, and environment in project execution and delivery. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009"&gt;Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris1960"&gt; Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is pragmatic by nature, integrating microeconomic theory with civil engineering practice &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; but, it is also a simplified application of economic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as [[price determination]], [[Competition#Economics_and_business|competition]] and [[supply and demand]]. 
&lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt;  
This poses new, underlying economic problems of resource allocation for civil engineers in delivering infrastructure projects and specifically, resources for project management, planning and control functions. 
{{TOC right}}
Civil engineers address these fundamental economic problems using specialized engineering economics knowledge as a framework for continuously “… probing economic feasibility…using a stage-wise approach…” throughout the project lifecycle.&lt;ref name="Magyar1968"/&gt; The application of this specialized civil engineering knowledge can be in the form of engineering analyses of [[Life-cycle cost analysis|life-cycle cost]], [[cost accounting]], [[cost of capital]] and the economic feasibility of engineering solutions for design, construction and project management. &lt;ref name="Magyar1968"/&gt; The civil engineer must have the ability to use engineering economy methodologies for the “formulation of objectives, specification of alternatives, prediction of outcomes” and estimation of minimum acceptability for investment and optimization. 
&lt;ref name="Peterson1965"&gt;George L. Peterson (1965) Toward the Improvement of The Traditional Course In Engineering Economy Through Unification As Applied Decision Theory, The Engineering Economist, 10:4, 17-31, DOI: 10.1080/00137916508928726 &lt;/ref&gt;
They must also be capable of integrating these economic considerations into appropriate [[Engineering design process|engineering solutions]] and [[Project plan|management plans]] that predictably and reliably meet [[project stakeholder]] expectations in a [[Sustainable design|sustainable manner]].     

The civil engineering profession provides a special function in our society and economy where investing substantial sums of funding in public infrastructure requires "...some assurance that it will perform its intended function." 
&lt;ref name="Dingwall2016"&gt;Dingwall, Robert. Essays on professions. Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the civil engineer exercising their professional judgment in making decisions about fundamental problems relies upon the profession’s knowledge of engineering economics to provide "the practical certainty" that makes the social investment in public infrastructure feasible. &lt;ref name="Dingwall2016"/&gt;   

==Course of Instruction==
Historically, [[coursework]] and [[curricula]] in engineering economics for civil engineers has focused on [[Capital budgeting]]: "...when to replace [[capital equipment]], and which of several [[alternative investments]] to make.&lt;ref name="Goetz1959"/&gt;

The '''Fleet Management Systems Interface (FMS)''' is a standard [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] to vehicle data of commercial vehicles. The six European manufacturers [[Daimler AG]], [[MAN SE|MAN AG]], [[Scania AB|Scania]], [[Volvo]] (including Renault), [[DAF Trucks]] and [[IVECO]] developed the so-called FMS-Standard in 2002 to make manufacturer-independent applications for [[telematics]] possible.

The following data are broadcast at the FMS interface:
* Vehicle improvement (all round)
* Vehicle speed (wheel based)
* Vehicle speed (from tachograph)
* Clutch switch (on/off)
* Brake switch (on/off)
* [[Cruise control]] (on/off)
* [[Power take-off|PTO]] (Status/Mode)
* Accelerator pedal position (0–100%)
* Total fuel used (litres since lifetime)
* Fuel level (0–100%)
* Engine speed
* [[Gross axle weight rating]] (kg)
* Total engine hours (h)
* FMS-Standard software version (supported modes)
* [[Vehicle identification number]] (ASCII)
* Tachograph information
* High-resolution vehicle distance
* Service distance
* Engine coolant temperature

The data are coded according to SAE [[J1939]]. The repetition rate of the data is between 20 ms (e.g. engine speed) and 10 seconds (e.g. vehicle identification number).

With the FMS standard it is now possible to have manufacturer independent applications and evaluations of the data.

The amount of data is dependent on the manufacturer and model of the vehicle and might be different. If some data are not available at the interface they are marked as not available.

According to a note from the [[truck manufacturer]]s, the FMS standard is seen as a worldwide standard. A direct connection to the internal vehicle bus system is not permitted by the truck manufacturers and could lead to the loss of warranty.
Meanwhile, some manufacturers are quite restrictive in their workshops and cut all unknown connections to the internal [[Bus (computing)|bus system]].

According to [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] ca. 160,000 vehicles were fitted with an FMS standard interface in 2007.
The FMS-Standard was as well the base for the Bus-FMS-Standard for buses and coaches which was published in the year 2004.

[[Fundamental analysis]] software automates analysis that supports fundamental analysts in their review of a company's financial statements and valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamental Analysis: Introduction|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The following are the most common features of fundamental analysis applications.

===Backtesting===

Enables traders to test fundamental analysis strategies or algorithms to see what kind of return they would have achieved if they had invested based on that strategy or algorithm in the past. Backtest results will typically display total and annualized returns compared to a benchmark such as the [[S&amp;P 500]]. In addition to returns, backtest results will also display [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] statistics such as average beta or maximum drawdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Backtesting: Interpreting The Past|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/030205.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scanner===

Stock scanning, or screening, is the most common feature of fundamental analysis software. Scanners enable users to 'scan' the market, be it stocks, options, currencies etc., to identify investment opportunities that meet a user's specific investment criteria. Using a fundamental analysis scanner, a user could, for example, scan the market to identify stocks with below industry average PE Ratios and above industry average sales growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stock Screener|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockscreener.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alerts===

Alerts are a common feature of fundamental analysis software. Alerts will typically notify the investor to buy or sell a stock, or notify an investor when a stock enters or exits his/her saved strategy. When alert conditions are met, a notification is typically communicated via an on screen pop up or sent as an email.

===Data Feed===

Fundamental analysis software is typically used with end of day (EOD), delayed or real time data feeds. EOD data feeds provide the end of day close, open, high, and low price for the given equity and is typically updated once a day at market close. Delayed data is typically delayed 15 to 30 minutes depending on the exchange and is the most commonly used data feed type. Real time data feeds provide tick by tick 'real time' data.

===Built in Strategies===

Most fundamental analysis software includes built in strategies that have been validated with [[backtesting]] to give positive returns on average. Some examples of built in strategies include: Stock Investor Pro's IBD Stable 70 or Equities Lab's Dividend Champions. Users will typically find a built in strategy that aligns with their interests and investment style then follow the strategy to keep up with stocks that pass the strategy.

===Broker Interface===

Some fundamental analysis software can be integrated with brokerage platforms to enable traders to place trades, or to update the users portfolio with what is actually held in the brokerage account.

'''Hamburger University''' is a {{convert|130000|sqft|sing=on}} [[training]] facility of [[McDonald's]], located in [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], a western [[suburb]] of [[Chicago]]. This [[corporate university]] was designed to instruct personnel employed by McDonald's in the various aspects of [[restaurant management]]. More than 80,000 restaurant managers, mid-managers and owner/operators have "graduated" from this facility.&lt;ref name="hamu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/corporate_careers/training_and_development/hamburger_university.html|title=Hamburger University|publisher=McDonald's|date=2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Since its establishment, Hamburger University has been situated on an {{convert|80|acre}} campus. Restaurant employees receive approximately 32 hours of training in their first month with McDonald's and more than 5,000 students attend Hamburger University each year. Founder [[Ray Kroc]] oversaw lessons at its beginning.

In 2016 McDonald's Corporation announced it would move its U.S. and world headquarters including Hamburger University from its long time home in Oak Brook to a newly built complex on property which formerly housed [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Harpo Productions|Harpo Studios]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/06/13/mcdonalds-moving-headquarters-to-chicago/85821422/ McDonald's moving headquarters to downtown Chicago by 2018] (Retrieved from USA Today on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mcdonalds-headquarters-0603-biz-20160602-story.html McDonald's to move HQ to Chicago as soon as 2018, source says] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-mcdonalds-oak-brook-property-20180112-story.html McDonald's begins selling off Oak Brook property before headquarters move] (Retrieved from the Chicago Tribune on 31 March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017 McDonald's put up for sale or sold most of its Oak Brook campus.

==Popular culture==
Hamburger University was satirized in the 1986 comedy, ''[[Hamburger... The Motion Picture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{BFI Explore|id=4ce2b722ee9e8|title=Hamburger - The Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also spoofed by McDonald's itself in a commercial with [[Ronald McDonald]] in which several [[animatronic]] hamburgers were shown graduating from school.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44224">'''Innovation leadership''' is a philosophy and technique that combines different leadership styles to influence employees to produce creative ideas, products, and services. The key role in the practice of innovation leadership is the innovation leader.&lt;ref&gt;Gliddon, D. G. (2006).

Forecasting a competency model for innovation leaders using a modified [[delphi technique]]. (Doctoral dissertation)&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. David Gliddon (2006) developed the competency model of innovation leaders and established the concept of innovation leadership at [[Penn State University]].

As an approach to organization development, innovation leadership can support achievement of the mission or the vision of an organization or group. With new technologies and processes, it is necessary for organizations to think innovatively to ensure continued success and stay competitive.&lt;ref name="Dess &amp; Pickens (2000)"&gt;Dess, G.

California Management Review, 38, 8-30&lt;/ref&gt; to adapt to new changes, “The need for innovation in organizations has resulted in a new focus on the role of leaders in shaping the nature and success of creative efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, M., &amp; Licuanan, B. (2004), Leading for innovation: Conclusions, issues, and directions. The Leadership Quarterly, 15, 163-171&lt;/ref&gt;” Without innovation leadership, organizations are likely to struggle.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)"/&gt; This new call for innovation represents the shift from the 20th century, traditional view of organizational practices, which discouraged employee innovative behaviors, to the 21st-century view of valuing innovative thinking as a “potentially powerful influence on organizational performance.”&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange"&gt;Mumford, M. D., Scott, G. M., Gaddis, B., &amp; Strange, J. M. (2002). Leading creative people: Orchestrating expertise and relationships. ''[[The Leadership Quarterly]]'', 13, 705 – 750&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

To have a clear understanding of what innovation leadership involves, one must first understand the concept of [[innovation]]. Although there is some controversy over how it can be defined, through general consensus in the literature, it can be described as novel ideas of viable products that are put into operation.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery"&gt;Hunter, S.T., Cushenbery, L. (2011). Leading for innovation: Direct and indirect influences. Advances in Developing Human Resource, 13, 248-265&lt;/ref&gt; It includes three different stages, which are all dynamic and iterative (constant):

# Idea Generation
# Evaluation
# Implementation

The two types of innovation include exploratory innovation, which involves generating brand new ideas, and value-added innovation, which involves modifying and improving ideas that already exist.&lt;ref name="Benner, Tushman"&gt;Benner, M. J., &amp; [[Michael L. Tushman|Tushman, M. L.]] (2003). Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited. The Academy of Management Review, 238-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda"&gt;Jansen, J. J. P., Van den Bosch, F. A. J., &amp; [[Volberda, H. W.]] (2006). Exploratory innovation, exploitative innovation, and performance: Effects of organizational antecedents and environmental :moderators. Management Science, 52, 1661−1674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March"&gt;March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. Organization Science, 2, 71−87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch"&gt;Rosing, K., Frese, M., &amp; Bausch, A. (2011). Explaining the heterogeneity of the leadership-innovation relationship: Ambidextrous leadership. The Leadership Quarterly, 22, 956-974&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas generated must be useful to be considered innovative. Innovation should also not be confused with [[creativity]], which is merely the generation of a novel idea that may not necessarily be put into operation—though these words are sometimes used interchangeably in research literature when speaking about innovation leadership. Innovation leadership is a complex concept, as there is no single explanation or formula for a leader to follow to increase innovation. As a result, innovation leadership encompasses a variety of different activities, actions, and behaviors that interact to produce an innovative outcome.

=== Value-added Innovation ===

Exploratory and value-added innovation require different leadership styles and behaviors to succeed.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Vera, &amp; Corssan" /&gt; Value-added innovation (PwC, 2010) involves refining and revising an existing product or service and typically requires minimal risk taking (compared to exploratory innovation, which often involves taking a large risk); in this case, it is most appropriate for a leader for innovation to adopt a transactional form of leadership.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oke et al"&gt;Oke, A., Munshi, N., Walumbwa, F. O. (2009). The influence of leadership on innovation processes and activities. Organizational Dynamics, 38, 64-72&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a transactional leadership style does not use open leadership behaviors such as encouraging employees to experiment and take risks, but rather uses closed leadership behaviors that do not condone or reward risk-taking. Companies whose innovation leaders use transactional leadership for value-added innovation purposes include Toyota Motor Co., General Motors Corp., and Ford Motor Co.;&lt;ref name="Oke et al" /&gt; examples of these companies’ value-added innovations such as making improvements on existing cars by making them faster, more comfortable, and getting better gas mileage. 
 
Occasionally a value-added innovation may require a completely new way of thinking and possibly taking new risks. An example of this scenario can be illustrated through Aspirin; this was an existing product, traditionally used as an analgesic to alleviate aches and pains, but has been introduced into a new and different market by extending its uses to help prevent heart attack and reduce blot clot formation. In this example, the usage of an existing product was re-worked and introduced into a new market. While an existing product is being changed and/or improved upon, characterizing it as a value-added innovation, outside-the-box thinking, research, and risk-taking are now required since it is being introduced into a new market. In this case, a transformational leadership style is a more appropriate style to use.
 
The innovation leader must gauge if (and how much) risk and radical thinking are involved in the value-added innovation to determine which leadership style to use in a situation. The leader must be flexible—able to switch leadership behaviors when necessary.

=== Exploratory Innovation ===

Exploratory innovation refers to the generation of novel ideas, strategies, and solutions through the use of strictly open behaviors exhibited most often by transformational leaders. The foundation of exploratory innovation is characterized by search, discovery, experimentation, and risk taking. It is the organization's focus on generating new ideas, products and strategies; in contrast to exploitative innovation, which focuses on building and extending already existing ideas. Some studies have shown that explorative and exploitative innovation require different structures, strategies, processes, capabilities, and cultures.&lt;ref name="He, Wong"&gt;He, Z., Wong, P. (2004). Exploration vs. Exploitation: An empirical test of the ambidexterity hypothesis. Organization Science, 15, (4), 481-494&lt;/ref&gt; See Innovative Organizational Climate/Culture. Exploratory innovation requires flexibility, opportunism, adaptability, and for leaders to provide intellectual stimulation to their subordinates.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt; In this approach to innovation, the leadership style that is primarily used is transformational. The behaviors exhibited are believed to achieve the desired creative outcome from employees through the application of individualized consideration, charisma, and inspirational motivation.

For example, in one study of the innovation practices at AXA Insurance in Ireland, the CEO John O’Neil engaged in transformational leadership behaviors and introduced the “MadHouse” program that combined workers from different departments and levels of the organization to work together in a creative way. The result of this experiment after six months was 150 new business ideas for products and services.&lt;ref name="Oke 2002"&gt;Oke, A. (2002). Improving the innovative capability of a service company. Journal of Change Management, 2, (3), 272-281&lt;/ref&gt; Explorative and Value-added innovation are often referenced together, but surprisingly little research shows an interaction between the two. However, there is an understanding that in some circumstances a ‘balance’ must be attained to achieve superior employee performance.&lt;ref name="Tushman &amp; O'Rielly (1996)" /&gt; For example, not all novel ideas are implemented, and may be resurrected later. The organization may need to switch gears and adopt exploitative strategies to revise and refine the idea to match present needs.

== Foundations of Innovation Leadership ==

Innovation leadership has roots in [[path-goal theory]] and [[leader-member exchange theory]]. Certain elements within an organization are also needed for innovation leadership to succeeded. Wolfe (1994),&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;Wolfe, R. (1994). Organizational innovation: Review, critique and suggested research directions. Journal of Management Studies, 31, 405-431&lt;/ref&gt; as cited by Sarros, Cooper, &amp; Santora, (2008)&lt;ref name="Sarros, Cooper, &amp; Santora (2008)" /&gt; has pointed out that one antecedent factor for innovation is [[organizational culture]]. Likewise, Isaksen, Laver, Ekvail &amp; Britz (2001) &lt;ref name="Isaksen, Lauer, Ekvail, &amp; Britz"&gt;Isaksen, S. G., Lauer, K. J., Ekvail, G., Britz, A., (2001). Perceptions of the best and worst climate for creativity: Preliminary validation evidence for the Situational Outlook Questionnaire. Creativity Research Journal, 13, (2), 171-184&lt;/ref&gt; concur that innovative endeavors fail without a supportive climate. This antecedent of a supportive organizational culture/climate encompasses encouragement of creativity, [[autonomy]], resources, and pressures. Additional foundational elements for innovation leadership include creative work, a creative workforce, and certain leader attributes.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange"/&gt;

=== Roots in Path-Goal Theory ===

The basis of [[path-goal theory]] uses a similar view of leadership, in that it advocates different types of leadership (e.g., participative, supportive) behaviors, much like innovation leadership does. However, it is contingent on employee and environmental factor to be effective.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;House, R. J., (1996). Path-Goal theory of leadership: Lessons, legacy, and a reformulated theory. Leadership Quarterly, 7, (3), 323-352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, M. G., (1996). R. J. House’s “A Path-Goal Theory of Leader Effectiveness”. Leadership Quarterly, 7, (3), 305-309&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a single leader using different leadership behaviors originated in path-goal theory, and has been associated with the framework underlying innovation leadership, which also allows the creation of a work environment conducive to innovative thinking—which is the cognitive process of generating novel and useful ideas.

Creating this type of work environment through innovation leadership involves open leadership behaviors that resemble some leader behaviors proposed by Path-goal theory—for example, upward influence and supportive/considerate behaviors.&lt;ref name=House /&gt; In innovation leadership, these behaviors encourage the creative team to generate as many novel ideas as possible and lead to evaluation and implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref name="Jansen, Van den Bosch, Volberda" /&gt;

=== Roots in Leader-Member Exchange Theory ===

[[Leader-member exchange theory]] (LMX theory) is another one of the building blocks of innovation leadership. It follows the same idea as Path-goal theory and innovation leadership, that multiple leadership styles are necessary in managing multiple subordinates but takes it a step further. LMX involves adopting a unique leadership style for each employee. Past studies indicate that LMX theory has been shown to have an effect on innovation.&lt;ref name="Basu, Green"&gt;Basu, R., Green, S.G. (1997) Leader-member exchange and transformational leadership: An empirical examination of innovative behaviours in leader-member dyads. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 27, 477-99.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney, Farmer, &amp; Graen"&gt;Tierney, P., Farmer, S.M. and Graen, G.B. (1999), An examination of leadership and employee creativity: the relevance of traits and relationships, Personnel Psychology, 52, 591-620&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that leader-member exchange relationships can predict significant organizational and attitudinal variables including higher job satisfaction and higher job performance.

Basu and Green (1997)&lt;ref name="Basu, Green" /&gt; found that innovative behavior is related to the quality of the leader-member exchange where high quality exchanges include contributions from both the leader and the follower. However, in a study by Jean Lee (2008),&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, J. (2008), Effects of leadership and leader-member exchange on innovativeness. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 23, (6), 670 – 6873&lt;/ref&gt; only the loyalty aspect of LMX (LMXL) was shown to be related to innovativeness. Leadership styles, transformational (positively related) and transactional (negatively related), were found to have an effect on innovativeness.

=== Innovative Organizational Culture/Climate ===

Some studies have shown evidence of organizational culture as the mediator of the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational innovation &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"&gt;Amabile, T. M., Conti, R., Coon, H., Lazenby, J., Herron, M. (1996) Assessing the work environment for creativity. The Academy of Management Journal, 39, (5), 1154-1184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deshpande, Farley, Webster"&gt;Deshpande, R., Farley, J., &amp; Webster, F. (1993). Corporate culture, customer orientation, and innovativeness in Japanese firms: A quadrad analysis. Journal of Marketing, 57, 23–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jassawalla, Sashittal"&gt;Jassawalla, A. R., &amp; Sashittal, H. C. (2002). Cultures that support product innovation processes. Academy of Management Executive, 16, 42-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prather, Turrell"&gt;Prather, C. W., &amp; Turrell, M. C. (2002). Involve everyone in the innovation process. Research Technology Management,45,13-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and performance.&lt;ref name="Ogbonna &amp; Harris"&gt;Ogbonna, E., &amp; Harris, L. C. (2000). Leadership style, organizational culture and performance: Empirical evidence from UK companies. International Journal of Human Resource :Management, 11(4), 766-788&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xenikou &amp; Simosi"&gt;Xenikou, A., &amp; Simosi, M. (2006). Organizational culture and transformational leadership as predictors of business unit performance. Journal of Managerial Psychology,21(6),566-57&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for transformational leadership to affect organizational innovation, an organization must have a strong innovative culture in addition to a leader with a [[transformational leadership]] style.

Organizational culture refers to an organization's deep structure, normative beliefs, and shared behavioral expectations. This culture is fairly constant and can influence interorganizational relations. Climate refers to the way that individuals perceive the extent to which the organizational culture impacts them. The two essentially are interrelated. One proposed model for assessing a creative environment in organizations includes the following dimensions:&lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt;

==== Encouragement of Creativity ====

Encouragement of creativity is the most frequently mentioned dimension in the literature. It operates at three major levels, each level containing multiple aspects.

[[File:Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity, from Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, &amp; Heron (1996).png|thumbnail|Conceptual Model Underlying Assessment of Perceptions of the Work Environment for Creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron" /&gt;]]

==== Organizational Encouragement ====

The first level is Organizational Encouragement. This involves encouragement of risk-taking and idea generation from all levels of management, fair and supportive evaluation of new ideas, recognition and reward of creativity, and collaborative idea flow across an organization. Each of these are equally important aspects of organizational encouragement but the third aspect, recognition and reward of creativity, may have adverse effects if the sole purpose for engaging in an activity is to gain reward.

==== Supervisory Encouragement ====

The second level, Supervisory Encouragement, highlights the roles of supervisors and project managers in goal clarity, open interaction between supervisors and subordinates, and supervisory support of a team's work and ideas. This level of encouragement points to the concepts of transformational leadership and LMX that emphasise the importance of the interactions of supervisors and subordinates in innovative performance.

==== Work Group Encouragement ====

The third level of encouragement is Work Group Encouragement. Diversity in team members’ backgrounds and openness to ideas affects creativity because individuals are exposed to a variety of novel and unusual ideas and such exposure had been demonstrated to have a positive effect on creative thinking &lt;ref name="Parnes &amp; Noller"&gt;Parnes, S. J., &amp; Noller, R. B. (1972). Applied creativity: The creative studies project-Part II: Results of the two-year program. Journal of Creative Behavior, 6, 164-186&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autonomy ====

Autonomy is believed to foster creativity since studies have revealed that individuals produce more creative work and experience increased intrinsic motivation when they have a sense of control and ownership over their work and ideas and they perceive themselves as having a choice in how their goals are accomplished, whether those goals are given to them by their supervisor or chosen by themselves.

==== Resources ====

Resources have been suggested to be directly related to creativity in organizations. Individuals’ perceptions of the availability of resources may lead to increased beliefs of the likelihood that the ideas they generate have a possibility of reaching the implementation stage.

==== Pressures ====

The little evidence that exists on the dimension of pressure suggests somewhat paradoxical influences. Some degree of pressure could have a positive effect if the pressure originates from the challenging and intellectual nature of the task itself, increasing intrinsic motivation. However, if the pressure experienced is perceived extreme it could counteract creativity. Amabile et al. (1996) &lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt; identify two forms of pressure: excessive workload pressure and challenge. They suggest that the first should have a negative influence on creativity while the second should have a positive one.

==== Organizational Impediments to Creativity ====

Although there has been little research on the work of environment factors that undermine creativity, some research suggests that these impediments include internal strife, conservatism, and rigid, formal management structures within organizations.&lt;ref name="Kimberley"&gt;36.	Kimberley, J. R. (1981). Managerial innovation. In P. C. Nystrom &amp; W. H. Starbuck (Eds.), Hand-book of organizational design: 84-104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimberley, Evanisko"&gt;Kimberley, J. R., &amp; Evanisko, M. J. (1981). Organizational innovation: The influence of individual, organizational and contextual factors on hospital adoption of technological and administrative innovations. Academy of Management Journal, 24, 689-713&lt;/ref&gt; This dimension is seen as working against autonomy and tends to have an inverse effect as individuals may perceive a more controlling environment.&lt;ref name="Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, Herron"/&gt;

=== Creative Work ===

Creative work can occur at any job but more specifically it can occur in jobs where there are complicated, ill-defined problems requiring innovative solutions.&lt;ref name="Besemer &amp; O’Quin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ford /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward, Smith, &amp; Finke" /&gt; The fact that the creative problems are ill-defined makes the creative work uncertain, and it may involve risky efforts.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; It is also resource intensive, demanding, and time consuming work&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; requiring high levels of motivation &lt;ref name="Collins, Amabile"&gt;Collins, M. A., &amp; Amabile, T. M. (1999). Motivation and creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity, 297–312. Cambridge, England: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelz &amp; Andrews"&gt;Pelz, D. C., &amp; Andrews, F. M. (1966). Autonomy, coordination, and simulation in relation to scientific achievement. Behavioral Science, 12, 89 – 97&lt;/ref&gt; and often requires collaboration.&lt;ref name="Abra"&gt;Abra, J. (1994). Collaboration in creative work: an initiative for investigation. Creativity Research Journal, 8, 205 – 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cagliano, Chiesa, &amp; Manzini"&gt;Cagliano, R., Chiesa, V., &amp; Manzini, R. (2000). Differences and similarities in managing technological collaborations in research, development, and manufacturing: a case study.

In R. J. Sternberg, &amp; J. E. Davidson (Eds.), The nature of insight (pp. 365 – 396 ). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work must also involve both novel idea generation and novel idea implementation &lt;ref name="Vincent, Decker &amp; Mumford"&gt;Vincent, A. H., Decker, B. D., &amp; Mumford, M. D. (2002). Divergent thinking, intelligence, and expertise: a test of alternative models. Creativity Research Journal, 14, 163 – 178&lt;/ref&gt; and requires expertise on the part of the workforce.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt;

=== Creative Workforce ===

A creative workforce is needed for innovation leadership to be successful. Creative people have expertise on the subject requiring innovation and tend to use work as a source of identity.&lt;ref name="Rostan"&gt;Rostan, S. M. (1998). A study of young artists: the emergence of artistic and creative identity. Journal of Creative Behavior, 32, 278-301. Creativity Research Handbook: Volume II. Cresskill, :NJ: Hampton&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, they are powerfully intrinsically motivated by professional achievement opportunities and recognition. Creative workers are also commonly characterized as highly valuing their autonomy; additional dispositional attributes include openness, flexibility, cognitive complexity, self-confidence, dominance, and [[introversion]].&lt;ref name="Fiest, 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiest &amp; Gorman"&gt;Fiest, G. J., &amp; Gorman, M. E. (1998). The psychology of science: Review and integration of a nascent discipline. Review of General Psychology, 2, 3–47&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns of characteristics creative workers exhibit typically allow them to confidently explore alternative ideas under ambiguous conditions.&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988" /&gt;

=== Leader Attributes/Characteristics ===

Successful innovation leadership requires a leader with certain characteristics. These include expertise in the domain, creativity, ability to carry out transformational leadership behaviors, planning and sense-making, and social skills.&lt;ref name="Mumford, Scott, Gaddis, Strange" /&gt; Innovative leaders can be recruited and hired through professional networks and referrals or alternatively found through succession planning, which involves identifying innovative leaders who are already working within the organization.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)" /&gt;

== Types of Innovation Leadership Styles ==

In addition to these foundations, various &lt;ref&gt;leadership&lt;/ref&gt; styles play an important role in innovation leadership, each of which are used at different stages of the innovation process or for different types of innovation (value-added vs. exploratory). Frequently associated leadership styles include transformational leadership,&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen, Lin, Lin, &amp; McDonough III"&gt;Chen, M. Y., Lin, C. Y., Lin, H., McDonough III, E. F. (2012). Does transformational leadership facilitate technological innovation? The moderating roles of innovative culture and incentive compensation. Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 29, 239-264&lt;/ref&gt; [[transactional leadership]],&lt;ref name="Jansen, Vera, &amp; Corssan"&gt;Jansen, J. J. P., Vera, D., &amp; Crossan, M. (2009). Strategic leadership for exploration and exploitation: The moderating role of environmental dynamism. The Leadership Quarterly, 20(1), 5–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss &amp; Ritossa"&gt;Moss, S. A., &amp; Ritossa, D. A. (2007). The impact of goal orientation on the association between leadership style and follower performance, creativity and work attitudes. Leadership, 3(4), :433–456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayan, Bendetto, &amp; Colak"&gt;Dayan, M., Di Benedetto, C. A., &amp; Colak, M. (2009). Managerial trust in new product development projects: Its antecedents and consequences. R&amp;D Management, 39, (1), 2137&lt;/ref&gt; and Ambidextrous leadership.&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt; The type of leadership most strongly associated with innovation is transformational leadership.&lt;ref name="Rosing, Frese &amp; Bausch" /&gt;

== Key Activities of Innovation Leadership ==

=== Idea Generation ===

As mentioned above, different leadership styles and behaviors may be more appropriate at different stages of the innovation process. Current research supports the notion that in the idea generation process, innovation leadership requires a leader to use a more transformational style of leadership.&lt;ref name="King &amp; Anderson"&gt;King, N., &amp; Anderson, N. (1990). Innovation in working groups. In M. A. West, &amp; J. L. Farr (Eds.), Innovation and creativity at work, 81–100&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, a leader needs to promote a safe environment for employees/team members to voice novel ideas and original thinking as well as provide workers with the resources to do so effectively.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; Research has also found that leaders who engage in unconventional behaviors, associated with transformational leadership, were seen as stronger role models and, as a result, increase creative performance in their subordinates. For example, the founders of Google have been known to wear capes and jump-shoes around the office,&lt;ref name="Schmidt, 2010"&gt;Schmidt, E. (2010, May). How I did it: Google’s CEO on enduring lessons of a quirky IPO.  Harvard Business Review. Retrieved from http://hbr.org/2010/05/how-i-did-it-googles-ceo-on-the-enduring-lessons-of-a-quirky-ipo/ar/1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vise &amp; Malseed" /&gt; thus inspiring more outside-the-box thinking in their employees. These open leadership behaviors convey that unorthodox and unconventional ideas and behaviors are not only accepted but also encouraged.

=== Idea Evaluation and Implementation ===

In addition to providing a climate for idea generation, innovation leadership also requires leaders to ensure that the process of idea generation does not overshadow the evaluation and implementation processes. During these phases of leadership, leaders must support some ideas while discarding other ideas and put the supported ideas into production. The role of the leader must shift away from a transformational style to a more transactional style of leadership, which involves being more direct and critical toward the ideas generated. A leader now needs to ensure that constructive discussions of innovative ideas are taking place among their subordinates. This serves to evaluate the usefulness of each idea, eliminate those that do not appear viable to the organization or goal, and push the ones that do appear viable into the production phase. The leader must adopt what are known as closed leadership behaviors to achieve this. Instead of stimulating idea generation, the leader must shift focus from generating new ideas toward fine-tuning existing ideas to achieve progress toward the goal, and ultimately implement the idea. This challenge of balancing differing leadership styles when appropriate is called the ''generator evaluator paradox''. It is important to consider the role of ambidextrous leadership, since a leader must be able to switch between leadership roles and styles when necessary to successfully lead for innovation. Paradoxes of innovation leadership are discussed below.

== Innovation Leadership and Influence ==

Depending on the type of leadership style that is adopted by the innovation leader, the leader may have either a direct or indirect influence on your employees.

=== Direct Influences ===

Direct forms of influence in leading innovation include:
* providing creative input and idea suggestion to employees
* providing employees with clear and concrete goals
* allocating organizational resources (i.e. research and development spending; manpower) for implementing ideas

=== Indirect Influences ===

Indirect influences get the same results without providing explicit guidance to employees. These types of influences include:
* establishing a supportive climate for creativity within the organization
* acting as a role model for innovative thinking
* providing employees with rewards and recognition for innovative thinking
* hiring and team composition (i.e. putting together teams with specific skill sets needed for innovative thinking, or hiring employees with creative personalities without planning what they work on).

== Proposed Model for Innovation Leadership ==

A proposed model for innovation leadership has been a multilevel process model of innovation,&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; which uses the direct and indirect leadership on the processes of innovation mentioned in the above section to promote the innovation process. In the model, indirect leadership influences affect the individual creativity (generation phase) and team creativity (evaluation phase) process. Direct leadership influences affect the team creativity (evaluation phase) process and the organizational innovation process (implementation phase). The individual creativity (generation phase) box in the model represents the process of the individual generating the initial idea or ideas and proposing them to their team. The team creativity (evaluation phase) box represents the process of the team taking that idea, making alterations and fine-tuning it to the point of making prototypes, formalized sketches, or simulations. The organizational innovation (implementation) box represents taking those [[prototypes]], sketches, or simulations and testing, evaluating, and possibly mass-producing them.

[[File:Figure 1. Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation, from Hunter &amp; Cushenberry (2011).png|thumbnail|Figure 1. Model of direct and indirect leadership influences on the process of innovation &lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt;]]

Two very important key features of this model should be mentioned:
# The three stages of innovation (idea generation, evaluation, and implementation) are not independent of one another.
# The stages in the model should not be viewed in a “lock-step fashion,” meaning that there are both backward and forward influences and activities affecting each of the three stages. For example, ideas are generated, discussed, and tested only to feed information back into the system, starting the process from the beginning again.&lt;ref name="Finke, Ward, &amp; Smith, 1992"&gt;Finke, R. A., Ward, T. B., &amp; Smith, S. M. (1992). Creative cognition: Theory, research, and applications. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The forward and backward arrows between individual creativity and team creativity, the forward and backward arrows between team creativity and organizational innovation, as well as the arrow from organizational innovation to individual creativity visually represent this key feature.

== Paradoxes of Innovation Leadership ==

Innovation leadership is complex, as can be seen from the Hunter &amp; Cushenbery (2011) model,&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt; and often [[paradoxes]] emerge that require leaders to strike a delicate balance between two conflicting roles (e.g. encouraging innovative ideas vs. limiting innovative ideas to include only those that are most viable and useful to the organization). A balance must be struck, not only within the leader and their behaviors, but between conflicting interests of involved parties as well. These include conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams, between leaders and situational/contextual factors, and between the employees/teams and the organization. Critical potential paradoxes that are often faced by leaders of innovation have been provided by Hunter, Thoroughgood, Meyer, &amp; Ligon (2011).&lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer" /&gt;

=== Internal/Localized Paradox ===

Internal/Localized paradoxes entail conflicting roles experienced within the leader.

=== Dual Expertise Paradox ===

The Dual Expertise Paradox postulates that a leader must have or acquire domain expertise while at the same time obtaining the necessary leadership skills to manage his/her employees and resources.

=== Generation Evaluation Paradox ===

The Generation Evaluation Paradox stipulates that a leader must encourage a supportive climate for the generation of new ideas and thinking outside-the-box while evaluating these ideas and realizing that not all creative ideas are useful and many may even fail (while not being too critical and negative of those ideas).

=== Team-level Paradox ===

Team-level paradoxes entail conflicting interests between the leader and the employees/teams

=== Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox ===

Creative Personality Cohesion Paradox is based on the research finding that creative workers generally highly value autonomy &lt;ref name="Fiest, 1999"&gt;Fiest, G. J. (1999). The influence of personality on artistic and scientific creativity. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of creativity (pp. 273 – 296). Cambridge, England: Cambridge University: Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiest &amp; Gorman" /&gt; and, as a result, often prefer to work alone. This paradox illustrates the difficulty leaders have in providing their employees with the autonomy they must be creative, while fostering team cohesion (or closeness) to facilitate idea sharing. A leader must also be careful not to encourage too much cohesion, as it may discourage group members from disagreeing (even constructively disagreeing) with fellow group members in an effort not to offend them or “rock the boat.”

=== Vision Autonomy Paradox ===

The Vision Autonomy Paradox highlights the dilemma a leader faces between providing structure and guidance to a team with respect to the vision of the goal, while at the same time stepping back and providing the team with enough autonomy, especially considering the fact that creative workers highly value autonomy. When leading for innovation, providing an overabundance of structure may result in a backlash from employees who feel their autonomy is being taken away from them.

=== Restriction Freedom Paradox ===

The Restriction Freedom Paradox underscores that innovation leaders need to allow employees enough time to develop creative endeavors and provide the resources to do so. At the same time the leader must take care to provide enough pressure that they are still motivated to complete the task &lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalley &amp; Gilson"&gt;Shalley, C. E., &amp; Gilson, L. L. (2004). What leaders need to know: A review of the social and contextual factors that can foster or hinder creativity. The Leadership Quarterly, 15, 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt; and not provide too many resources that it has a “deadening effect” on creativity.&lt;ref name="Csikszentmihalyi"&gt;Csikszentmihalyi, M. (1997). Creativity: Flow and the psychology of discovery and intervention. New York: Harper Collins Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situational Paradox ===

Situational Paradoxes entail conflicting interests between leaders and the situations they face.

=== Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox ===

The Intrinsic Extrinsic Paradox holds that instead of providing more readily available extrinsic motivation tools such as bonuses and salary increases, leaders must provide intrinsic motivation, which generally comes from within the employee, to their employees. This paradox is based on findings that intrinsic motivation is a key factor in facilitating creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, 1997"&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1997). Motivating creativity in organizations: On doing what you love and loving what you do. California Management Review, 40, 39 –58., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shalley &amp; Oldham"&gt;Shalley, C. E., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1997). Competition and creative performance: Effects of competitor presence and visibility. Creativity Research Journal, 10, 337–345.&lt;/ref&gt; and extrinsic motivators may either hinder creativity &lt;ref name="Amabile, 1985"&gt;Amabile, T. M. (1985). Motivation and creativity: Effects of motivational orientation on creative writers. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48, 393–399.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruglanksi, Friedman &amp; Zeeyi, 1971"&gt;Kruglanski, A. W., Friedman, I., &amp; Zeeyi, G. (1971). The effects of extrinsic incentive on some qualitative aspects of task performance. Journal of Personality, 39, 606 – 617.&lt;/ref&gt; or have an unclear relationship with creativity.&lt;ref name="Baer, Oldham, &amp; Cummings, 2003"&gt;Baer, M., Oldham, G. R., &amp; Cummings, A. (2003). Rewarding creativity: When does it really matter? The Leadership Quarterly, 14, 569 –586.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Hunter, 2005"&gt;47.	Mumford, M. D., &amp; Hunter, S. T. (2005). Innovation in organizations: A multi-level perspective on creativity. In F. J. Yammarino &amp; F. Dansereau (Eds.), Research in multi-level issues, 5, 11–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local Long-Term Paradox ===

The Local Long-Term Paradox posits that leaders of innovation must maintain their innovative edge by keeping an eye out for and capitalizing on potential opportunities, even at the risk of placing those ideas above or even eliminating ideas that he or she had previously inspired in their teams. The leader must also be capable of developing teams that are flexible enough to be passionate about ideas that may have replaced their own idea that was facilitated, inspired, and supported by their leader. This is where the paradox is most clearly visible.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Thoroughgood &amp; Myer"&gt;Hunter, S. T., Thoroughgood, C. N., Myer, A. T., &amp; Ligon, G. S. (2011). Paradoxes of leading innovative endeavors: Summary, Solutions, and Future Directions. Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts, 5, 54-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competition Collaboration Paradox ===

The [[competition collaboration paradox]] involves a leader developing open external relationships with other organizations to discover potential innovation opportunities, while ensuring the organization's emerging ideas are protected in a competitive environment.

=== Feedback Rigidity Paradox ===

The [[feedback rigidity paradox]] involves leaders seeking out and using customer and client advice and feedback towards innovative endeavors to a certain extent, while maintaining control of the vision and not letting the feedback dictate to them—as clients and customers often criticize innovations early on.

=== Failure Success Paradox ===

The Failure Success Paradox is the idea that innovation leaders must ensure a safe organizational culture that is willing to embrace risk and failure, while at the same time making sure that the organization is also producing successful products and services despite embracing risk and errors.

=== Additional Paradoxes ===

Additional paradoxes identified by Hunter et al. (2011) that do not directly involve the leader but are worth mentioning are the paradoxes that occur between teams and the organization. These include the Insularity Cohesion paradox, the Champion Evaluator paradox, and the Creativity Cost paradox.&lt;ref name="Hunter, Cushenbery" /&gt;

== Outcomes ==

Outcomes of innovation leadership include inspiring employees to the create and implement novel ideas for products, services, and technologies. In addition, these novel ideas can also be used to solve problems within an organization. What this illustrates is that innovation spurred by innovation leadership can be translated across various industries and can be used for a multitude of purposes.&lt;ref name="Besemer &amp; O’Quin"&gt;Besemer, S. P., O’Quin, K. (1999). Confirming the three-factor creative product analysis matrix model in an American sample. Creativity Research Journal, 12, 287 – 296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;Ford, C. M. (2000). Creative developments in creativity theory. Academy of Management Review, 25, 284 – 289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mumford &amp; Gustafson, 1988"&gt;Mumford, M. D., &amp; Gustafson, S. B.

Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, inspiring and initiating organizational innovation through innovation leadership can serve to advance the organization it to the next level.&lt;ref name="McEntire &amp; Green-Shortridge (2011)" /&gt;

== Real-World Examples of Innovation Leadership ==

Companies that use innovative leadership include 3M, which lets employees work on a project of their choosing for 15% of their time.&lt;ref name="Kanter, R.

Similarly, Google allows employees one day a week to work on their own project.&lt;ref name="Vise &amp; Malseed"&gt;Vise, D. A., &amp; Malseed, M. (2005). The Google story: Inside the hottest business, media, and technology success of our time. New York, NY: Bantam Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{one source|date=November 2017}}

'''Macromanagement''' is a management theory with two different approaches to the definition that both share a common idea; management from afar. 

Contrary to [[micromanagement]] where managers closely observe and control the works of their employees, macromanagement is a more independent style of organizational management. Managers step back and give employees the freedom to do their job how they think it is best done, so long as the desired result is reached. This is the most commonly applied understanding of macromanagement. 

Both styles of management are viewed as a negative when taken to an extreme, so it is important for organizations to develop a balance of micro- and macromanagement practices and understand when to apply which. 

The second interpretation of macromanagement is when an organization views itself as a social [[institution,]] orienting its goals and purpose toward serving society. To do this, they align the organization’s values, norms, ethics with those of the society they are immersed in. In 1971, Alan Wells defined a social institution as “patterns of rules, customs, norms, beliefs and roles that are instrumentally related to the needs and purposes of society.” Other examples of social institutions in this respect include government and religious organizations, some more in-line with serving society that others.  

This interpretation of macromanagement is less about managing employees, but rather managing the organization from a broader perspective that is oriented toward the future. An organization that practices macromanagement greatly considers the future of the organization, the future of society, and their impact on one another.

'''Market intelligence''' is the information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident [[decision-making]] in determining strategy in areas such as [[market opportunity]], [[market penetration]] strategy, and [[market development]].&lt;ref name="Cornish"&gt;Cornish, S. L. “Product Innovation and the Spatial Dynamics of Market Intelligence: Does Proximity to Markets Matter?” Economic Geography. Volume: 73, Issue 2 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence includes the process of gathering data from the company’s external environment, whereas the [[Business intelligence]] process primarily is based on internal recorded events – such as sales, shipments and purchases. The purpose of incorporating Market Information or intelligence into the Business Intelligence process is to provide decision makers with a more “complete picture” of ongoing corporate performance in a set of given market conditions.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;Prescott, John and others, Proven Strategies in Competitive Intelligence (Wiley, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gathering market intelligence data ==
Effective market intelligence needs accurate market information that is gathered with right tools and methods. To gather information companies can conduct [[survey (human research)|survey]]s, [[interview]]s, visit and monitor competitors outlets or gather and buy data from different sources.

Traditional interviews and surveys can be done either in-house or by using specialists agencies. As more and more markets are digitalized the market intelligence space has seen a lot of new digital tools that companies can use. There are tools such as [https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home Google Consumer Survey] that enables companies to ask web users a question through Google network of online publishers. There are also specialist sites companies can buy market intelligence information and market intelligence software that companies can use to collect and monitor data from the internet.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mind map''' is a  [[diagram]] used to visually organize information. A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn H. Hopper, Practicing College Learning Strategies, 7th Edition, {{ISBN|9781305109599}}, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. Mind maps are considered to be a type of [[spider diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mind-map?q=mind+map |title=Mind Map noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept in the 1970s was "idea [[sunburst chart|sun bursting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/mindmapping-learning-study-memory/who-invented-mind-mapping.html |title=Who invented mind mapping |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Although the term "mind map" was first popularized by British [[popular psychology]] author and television personality [[Tony Buzan]], the use of diagrams that visually "map" information using branching and [[Radial tree|radial maps]] traces back centuries. These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, [[brainstorming]], [[memory]], [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s. Mind maps are similar in radial structure to [[concept map]]s, developed by learning experts in the 1970s, but differ in that the former are simplified by focusing around a single central key concept.

== Popularisation of the term "mind map" ==

Buzan's specific approach, and the introduction of the term "mind map", arose during a 1974 [[BBC]] TV series he hosted, called ''Use Your Head''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/blog/mapping-history/roots-of-visual-mapping/ |title=Roots of visual mapping - The mind-mapping.org Blog |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buzan|first=Tony |date=1974 |title=Use Your Head |location=London|publisher=BBC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, and companion book series, Buzan promoted his conception of radial tree, diagramming key words in a colorful, radiant, tree-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |title=Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview |website=KnowledgeBoard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000356/http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |archive-date=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzan says the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]. He argues that while "traditional" outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular assumptions about the functions of [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

==Mind map guidelines==
Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:

# Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
# Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
# Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
# Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
# The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
# Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
# Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
# Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
# Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
# Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.

== Uses ==

[[File:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
As with other diagramming tools, mind maps can be used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]]&lt;ref&gt;'Mind maps as active learning tools', by Willis, CL. Journal of computing sciences in colleges. {{ISSN|1937-4771}}. 2006. Volume:
21 Issue: 4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organization|organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, as a [[mnemonic technique]], or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

In addition to these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications; for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine]]s and search and tag query recommender.&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | chapter=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map.&lt;ref name=Beel2009 /&gt;

==Differences from other visualizations==

* ''Concept maps'': Mind maps differ from [[concept maps]] in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas. Also, concept maps typically have text labels on their connecting lines/arms. Mind maps are based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.  However, either can be part of a larger [[personal knowledge base]] system.
* ''Modelling graphs'': There is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML diagram]] or a [[semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps serve a different purpose: they help with memory and organization. Mind maps are collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics, and, through the use of colour, icons and visual links, are informal and necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
Cunningham (2005) conducted a user study in which 80% of the students thought "mindmapping helped them understand concepts and ideas in science".&lt;ref name="Cunningham05"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Glennis Edge Cunningham| title=Mindmapping: Its Effects on Student Achievement in High School Biology| year=2005| publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also report some subjective positive effects on the use of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Holland2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Holland, Lynda Holland, Jenny Davies| title=An investigation into the concept of mind mapping and the use of mind mapping software to support and improve student academic performance| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antoni2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author=D'Antoni, A.V., Zipp, G.P.| title=Applications of the Mind Map Learning Technique in Chiropractic Education: A Pilot Study and Literature| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive opinions on their effectiveness, however, were much more prominent among students of art and design than in students of computer and information technology, with 62.5% vs 34% (respectively) agreeing that they were able to understand concepts better with mind mapping software&lt;ref name="Holland2004" /&gt;. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline).&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |author2=Hussain, F. |author3=Hennessy, E.  |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions".&lt;ref name="Nesbit06"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nesbit, J.C., Adesope, O.O.| title=Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis| journal=Review of Educational Research| year=2006| volume=76| number=3| pages=413| publisher=Sage Publications| doi=10.3102/00346543076003413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". However, results were inconsistent, with the authors noting "significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.

===Features of mind maps===
Joeran Beel and Stefan Langer conducted a comprehensive analysis of the content of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Beel2011d"&gt;{{cite book| author=Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer| chapter=An Exploratory Analysis of Mind Maps| title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'11)| year=2011| publisher=ACM| url=http://docear.org/papers/An%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Mind%20Maps%20--%20preprint.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analysed 19,379 mind maps from 11,179 users of the mind mapping applications SciPlore MindMapping (now Docear) and [[MindMeister]]. Results include that average users create only a few mind maps (mean=2.7), average mind maps are rather small (31 nodes) with each node containing about three words (median). However, there were exceptions. One user created more than 200 mind maps, the largest mind map consisted of more than 50,000 nodes and the largest node contained ~7,500 words. The study also showed that between different mind mapping applications (Docear vs MindMeister) significant differences exist related to how users create mind maps.

===Automatic creation of mind maps===
There have been some attempts to create mind maps automatically. Brucks &amp; Schommer created mind maps automatically from full-text streams.&lt;ref name="Brucks2008"&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer| title=Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream| year=2008| arxiv=0810.4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberger et al. extracted the main story of a text and presented it as mind map.&lt;ref name="Rothenberger2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rothenberger, T, Oez, S, Tahirovic, E, Schommer, Christoph| title=Figuring out Actors in Text Streams: Using Collocations to establish Incremental Mind-maps| journal= | arxiv=0803.2856| year=2008| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.2856R}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a patent about automatically creating sub-topics in mind maps.&lt;ref name="Plotkin09"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Software tool for creating outlines and mind maps that generates subtopics automatically|journal=USPTO Application: 20090119584|volume=|author=Robert Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[List of concept- and mind-mapping software|Mind-mapping software]] can be used to organize large amounts of information, combining spatial organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind-mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the Internet, like spreadsheets, documents, Internet sites and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdevin.com/top-10-totally-free-mind-mapping-software-tools/|title=Top 10 Totally Free Mind Mapping Software Tools|last=Santos|first=Devin|date=15 February 2013|publisher=IMDevin|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that mind-mapping can improve learning/study efficiency up to 15% over conventional [[note-taking]].&lt;ref name="Farrand2002" /&gt;

'''Procurify''' is a cloud-based [[procurement software]] company located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Procurify's main product offering is a [[cloud-based]] procurement [[solution]] which can be used to manage company spending. Companies that offer procurement solutions will typically focus on automation and of company spending in real-time. The current Procurify platform is considered horizontal, rather than industry specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procurify Media Kit|url=https://www.procurify.com/media-kit|publisher=Procurify|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procurify is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia and was founded in 2013 by CEO Aman Mann, CTO Eugene Dong, and COO Kenneth Loi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Kit|url=https://www.procurify.com/assets/files/FounderBios.pdf|publisher=Procurify|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procurify's cloud based [[procurement]] software solution is used by companies to manage organizational purchasing and procurement. Like most e-procurement solutions available, Procurify focuses on providing users features including digital purchase order submission and accounts payable automation. Procurify is hosted on the [[Amazon Web Services]] and is built using [[Django (web framework)|Django]].  The solution is available as a [[SaaS]]. Procurify is offered as a browser-based and [[mobile procurement]] software.

== Company history ==
The company founders are [[BCIT School of Business]] alumni who graduated together in Operations Management in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Owner Invests With BCIT Alumni|url=http://commons.bcit.ca/update/2013/08/nba-owner-invests-with-bcit-alumni/|publisher=BCIT|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Got Mark Cuban To Invest In Our Company|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-money/business-funding/how-we-got-mark-cuban-to-invest-in-our-company/article13524012//|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for Procurify came from a BCIT class project where the founders Aman Mann - CEO, Eugene Dong - CTO, and Kenneth Loi - COO were randomly placed together to consult a Vancouver-based business on their internal processes.

In November 2012, they joined the Growlab Accelerator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GrowLab Announces Its Five Winter 2012 Cohort Companies|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/growlab-announces-its-five-winter-2012-cohort-companies-2012-11-20|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=714 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2013, Procurify graduated from Vancouver-based incubator program GrowLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GrowLab Companies on GlobalBC and ShawTV!|url=http://growlab.ca/growlab-companies-on-globalbc-and-shawt|publisher=GrowLab|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2014, Procurify raised a total of 1.2 Million seed round from venture capitalists Nexus Ventures, BDC and Mark Cuban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Knowlton|title=Vancouver's Procurify Raises $1.2 Million Seed Round from BDC, Mark Cuban|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/procurify-seed-round-mark-cuban-2014-04-16|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=BDC Venture Capital Invests in All Four GrowLab Graduates|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/bdc-invests-in-growlab-graduates-2013-03-01|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koetsier|first=John|title=Procurify is securing a $400K Mark Cuban investment even before graduating from GrowLab|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/20/procurify-is-securing-a-mark-cuban-investment-even-before-graduating-from-growlab/|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2015, Procurify raised another seed round totaling $4 Million from Point Nine Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC). Hootsuite’s CEO Ryan Holmes and its chief revenue officer Steve Johnson also participated in this round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|title=Procurify Raises $4M To Make Purchasing Easier For Businesses|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/procurify-raises-4m-to-make-purchasing-easier-for-businesses/#.emr7vl:6MaY|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where representations of a customer are held in more than one [[data set]], achieving a single customer view can be difficult: firstly because customer identity must be traceable between the records held in those systems, and secondly because anomalies or discrepancies in the customer data must be [[data cleansing|data cleansed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atominsight.com/about-us/blog/single-customer-view-hard|title=Why building a single customer view isn’t as easy as you might think|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the acquisition by an organisation of a single customer view is one potential outcome of successful [[master data management]]. Since 31 December, 2010, maintaining a single customer view, and submitting it within 72 hours, has become mandatory for [[financial institution]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] due to new rules introduced by the [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Experian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fscs.org.uk/industry/single-customer-view/|title=Deposit Guarantee Scheme - Customer Review -FSCS|website=www.fscs.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''software industry''' includes businesses  for [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]] that are using different business models, mainly either "license/maintenance based" (on-premises) or "[[Cloud computing|Cloud]] based" (such as [[SaaS]], [[PaaS]], [[IaaS]], MaaS, AaaS, etc.). The industry also includes [[software service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], [[consultancy|consulting]] and [[data recovery]].

==History==
The word "software" was coined as a prank as early as 1953, but did not appear in print until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Paul Niquette |title= Softword: Provenance for the Word 'Software'  |year= 1995 |url= http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/tocsoft.html }} adapted from ''Sophisticated: The Magazine'' {{ISBN|1-58922-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers, or the few commercial computer vendors of the time, such as [[UNIVAC]] and [[IBM]]. The first company founded to provide software products and services was [[Computer Usage Company]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recollections of the first software company |author= Elmer C. Kubie |journal= [[Annals of the History of Computing]] |volume= 16 |issue= 2 |publisher= [[IEEE Computer Society]]  |date= Summer 1994 |pages= 65–71 |doi= 10.1109/85.279238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, government, and business customers created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers. Some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. Others were done on a commercial basis, and other firms such as [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (founded in 1959) started to grow. Other influential or typical software companies begun in the early 1960s included [[Advanced Computer Techniques]], [[Automatic Data Processing]], [[Applied Data Research]], and [[Informatics General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry | first=Martin | last=Campbell-Kelly | authorlink=Martin Campbell-Kelly | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Computer Establishment | first=Katharine Davis | last=Fishman | publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company | location=New York | year=1981 | type=paperback 1982 | page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer/[[Computer hardware|hardware]] makers started bundling [[operating systems]], [[systems software]] and programming environments with their machines.

When [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) brought a relatively low-priced [[microcomputer]] to market, it brought computing within the reach of many more companies and universities worldwide, and it spawned great innovation in terms of new, powerful programming languages and methodologies. New software was built for microcomputers, so other manufacturers including IBM, followed DEC's example quickly, resulting in the [[IBM AS/400]] amongst others.

The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the [[personal computer]] ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought desktop computing to the office worker for the first time. In the following years, it also created a growing market for games, applications, and utilities. [[DOS]], [[Microsoft]]'s first [[operating system]] product, was the dominant operating system at the time.

In the early years of the 21st century, another successful [[business model]] has arisen for hosted software, called [[software-as-a-service]], or SaaS; this was at least the third time{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} this model had been attempted. From the point of view of producers of some [[proprietary software]], SaaS reduces the concerns about [[Software copyright|unauthorized copying]], since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition no [[client software]] is loaded onto the end user's PC.

==Size of the industry==
According to industry analyst [[Gartner]], the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US$407.3 billion, an increase of 4.8% over 2012. As in past years, the largest four software vendors were [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[SAP SE|SAP]] respectively.

|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2696317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mergers and acquisitions==
The software industry has been subject to a high degree of consolidation over the past couple of decades. Between 1995 and 2018 around 37,039 [[mergers and acquisitions]] have been announced with a total known value of US$ 1,166 bil. USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number and value of deals was set in 2000 during the high times of the [[dot-com bubble]] with 2,674 transactions valued at 105. bil. USD. In 2017, 2,547 deals were announced valued at $111 billion. Approaches to successfully acquire and integrate software companies are available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popp |first=Karl Michael |title=Mergers and Acquisitions in the Software Industry - foundations of due diligence |year=2013 |publisher=Books on demand |location=Norderstedt |isbn=978-3-7322-4381-5 |url=http://mergerduediligence.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a professional [[securities broker]] in the United States, an individual must take and pass the [[General Securities Representative Exam]] (Series 7) and in most states, the [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination]] (Series 63). To take the test, you must be sponsored by "a member firm, a self-regulatory organization (SRO), or an exchange." This requirement, as well as the administration of the test, is under the jurisdiction of FINRA, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]].&lt;ref name="Investo"&gt;{{cite web |title = Investopedia FAQs | url =http://www.investopedia.com/professionals/FAQs/series7/260304_1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals who are interested only in managing their own investments, several options exist to obtain a [[stock market]] education:

* Traditional classroom setting
* Non-traditional classroom settings
* Self-education
* Mentor/[[apprentice]]ship relationship

== Traditional classroom settings ==
Many colleges and universities offer courses of study in business, economics, and finance. However, the coursework is aimed at preparing the student for the professional world. They are not designed or intended to teach a student how to trade in the stock market, although the introductory/basic courses would provide a good basic foundation of knowledge. Those intending to follow the professional stockbroker career path usually begin their education by obtaining a degree in business, economics, or finance.

Some of the core subjects covered by an [[undergraduate|undergraduate education]] during the course of a financial/business college education are:

* Basic marketing
* Business communication
* [[Business ethics]]
* Financial accounting
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* Mathematics
* [[Microeconomics]]
* Real estate
* [[financial risk management|Risk management]]
* [[Statistics]]
&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web |title = Florida State University, College of Business undergraduate course requirements | url =http://cob.fsu.edu/fin/fin_ba_curriculum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calif"&gt;{{cite web |title = University of California, Haas School of Business undergraduate course requirements |url = http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202052836/http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |archivedate = 2010-02-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-traditional classroom settings ==
Non-traditional classroom settings are offered by:

* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material
* For-profit businesses

For-profit financial education companies exist that offer programs of study (also referred to as "systems" or "courses" &amp;ndash; the terminology varies) on stock market education. Unlike colleges that prepare students for working in the financial arena, these companies educate students with a more narrow focus &amp;ndash; how to trade [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] for the purpose of personal investing. Examples of such companies are [[thinkorswim]] (formerly Investools), Invested Central, [[Trading Advantage]], Global Finance School, and Rich Dad's Education (based on the "[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]" book by [[Robert Kiyosaki]]). These types of companies offer both classroom settings for learning and [[distance education]] programs.

Another aspect that differentiates for-profit stock market education companies from traditional colleges is the commercialization factor. For-profit stock market education companies frequently develop other products &amp;ndash; such as software and newsletters &amp;ndash; that they market to their students. Colleges and universities, frequently founded for the purpose of providing education and established as non-profit organizations, do not follow this business model.

== Mentor/apprentice relationship ==
Also referred to as "personal coaches," [[mentor]]s work one-on-one with a student, In this situation, the student receives more personal attention from the instructor than from a classroom or distance learning education. Some mentors offer their services for a fee.&lt;ref name="Mentor_1"&gt;{{cite web |title = Boris Gurevich, Ph.D. #1 Education Partner with InteractiveBrokers, AskTradeMentor.com | url =http://www.AskTradeMentor.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mentor_2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chicago School of Trading | url =http://www.thechicagoschooloftrading.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-taught ==
The following resources exist in libraries and on the Internet for an individual to learn about investing in the stock market:

* A [[stock market simulator]] allows one to trade without using real funds (also referred to as "[[paper trading]]"). These simulators are offered by organizations associated with the stock market (such as the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]) and the types of [[for-profit education]] companies mentioned in [[#Non-traditional_classroom_settings|Non-traditional classroom settings]].
* Articles
** Financial magazines like ''[[Money (magazine)]]'',''[[Kiplinger]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' provide investing articles, though their target market is aimed at more general investors. Magazines that focus on trading derivatives are ''Active Trader'' and ''Tradersworld''. Magazines with an online presence also offer access to some, if not all, of their articles online.
** Web sites devoted to the stock market or trading arena post articles online or send them via email to subscribers. These web sites can be free, non-profit, or for-profit.
* Books written by investors and traders.
* Online forums that discuss subjects related to the stock market and trading derivatives.
* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Association of Individual Investors]]
