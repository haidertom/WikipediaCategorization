      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8962">'''Advanced Innovation Design Approach''' (AIDA) is a holistic approach for enhancing innovative and competitive capability of industrial companies. The name Advanced Innovation Design Approach (AIDA) was proposed in the research project "Innovation Process 4.0" run at the [[University of Applied Sciences Offenburg]], Germany in co-operation with 10 German industrial companies in 2015-2017.&lt;ref&gt;Livotov P. [http://triz.h4u.eu/Innovator_01-2016_(02).pdf Systemic Approach for Enhancing Innovative and Competitive Capability of Industrial Companies - Research Concept. Journal of the European TRIZ Association  01-2016 (163-169)].&lt;/ref&gt;
AIDA can be considered as a pioneering mindset, an individually adaptable range of strongest innovation techniques such as comprehensive [[Front end innovation|front-end innovation]] process, advanced innovation methods, best tools and methods of the theory of inventive problem solving [[TRIZ]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] 4521 (2016). Inventive Problem Solving with TRIZ. Fundamentals and Definitions.&lt;/ref&gt; organisational measures for accelerating innovation, IT-solutions for Computer-Aided Innovation, and other tools for [[new product development]], elaborated in the recent decade in the industry and academia.

Initially the AIDA has been conceptualised as systemic approach including analysis, optimizations and further development of the innovation process and promoting the innovation climate in industrial companies. The innovation process with self-configuration, self-optimization, self-diagnostics and intelligent information processing and communication, is understood as a holistic system comprising following typical phases with feedback loops and simultaneous auxiliary or follow-up processes: uncovering of solution-neutral customer needs, technology and market trends, identification of the needs and problems with high market potential and formulation of the innovation tasks and strategy, systematic idea generation and problem solving, evaluation and enhancement of solution ideas, creation of innovation concepts based on solution ideas, evaluation of the innovation concepts as well as [[implementation]], validation and market launch of chosen innovation concepts. &lt;br&gt;
The Advanced Innovation Design Approach was refined and further developed for the application in the field of process engineering in the context of the [[EU]] research project "Intensified by Design - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling‚Äù within international consortium of 22 universities, research institutes and industrial companies under H2020 SPIRE programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibd-project.eu/ Intensified by Design] - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling. EU Research Project (Horizon 2020, SPIRE Programme)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principle of completeness ==

As a holistic innovation approach, AIDA postulates the complete problem analysis and a comprehensive idea generation and problem solving. The problems faced by the industry can not be solved by single eureka idea. 
The principle of completeness in the new product development can be illustrated by following 4 steps.&lt;ref&gt;Casner D. et al. (2017) [https://www.designsociety.org/publication/39714/Advanced+innovation+design+approach+for+process+engineering Advanced Innovation Design Approach for Process Engineering]. Proceedings of the ICED17 - 21st International Conference of Engineering Design, [[The Design Society|The Design Society]],  Aug. 21-25, 2017, Vancouver, [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
#Initial complex problem must be segmented into the partial problems. The problem ranking method helps to identify problems crucial for innovation success.
#The strongest TRIZ inventive principles replace the random [[brainstorming]], increasing the quality and quantity of ideas within a short period of time.  For each partial problem several ideas must be generated. No relevant idea should be overseen.
#The complementary solution ideas are combined to the solution concepts. A robust solution concept delivers solutions for all partial problems.
#The solution concepts often have their secondary side effects, like costs, risks or R&amp;D expenditures, which must be limited through concept optimization.

Another example demonstrates the principle of completeness in the phase of the innovation strategy formulation. For the complete identification of existing and future customer needs or benefits several complementary methods are used simultaneously (Tool 4. Innovation potential analysis):

*Analysis of market and technological trends, and others.

== AIDA innovation tools ==

AIDA tools or apps most frequently used in the practice include:

#Brainstorming 40x40: Generate 40 ideas with enhanced 40 TRIZ Inventive Principles (incl. 160 inventive sub-principles, 2017).
#Inno-Workshop: Tool for systematic problem solving and moderation of innovation workshops with TRIZ.
#[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ TRIZ] Inventor: Solving of bottle-neck problems with inventive algorithm ARIZ in its short form.
#Innovation potential analysis: comprehensive identification of innovation opportunities, customer benefits and segments with high market potential.
#New concept development: implementation of the selected innovation tasks (tool 04) into new concepts with high market potential.
#Root-conflict analysis and anticipatory failure identification: tool for elimination harmful effects.
#Systematic and creative cost cutting: for products and processes.
#InnoMonitor: tool for continuous  monitoring of innovative capability of companies (80 parameters and 10 key performance indicators).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">'''American political development''' (often abbreviated as '''APD''') is a subfield of [[political science]] that studies the historical development of [[politics in the United States]]. In American political science departments, it is considered a subfield within [[American political science|American politics]] and is closely linked to [[historical institutionalism]].

Scholarship in American political development focuses on "the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersh|first=Rogan|date=2005-01-01|title=The Growth of American Political Development: The View from the Classroom|jstor=3688034|journal=Perspectives on Politics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=335‚Äì345|doi=10.1017/s1537592705050243}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Orren]] and [[Stephen Skowronek]], co-founders of the subfield's [[Studies in American Political Development|flagship journal]], define American political development as the study of "durable shifts in governing authority" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Search-American-Political-Development/dp/0521547644|title=The Search for American Political Development|date=2004-05-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521547642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield emerged within [[American political science]] in the 1980s, alongside a general renewal of work in [[historical institutionalism]], as an "insurgent movement" that sought to refocus attention on the study of historical American politics and to use such historical study to recast the study of contemporary political phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-21|chapter=Distinctiveness and Necessity of American Political Development |title=Oxford Handbook of American Political Development| editors=Richard M.

APD shares overlaps with the research agendas of [[comparative politics]] (particularly [[Comparative historical research|comparative historical analysis]]), [[historical sociology]], and [[political history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polisci.northwestern.edu/research/department-strengths/american-political-development.html|title=American Political Development: Department of Political Science - Northwestern University|website=www.polisci.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholarship in APD differs from political history in that the former's "primary concerns are analytical, conceptual, and theoretical rather than historical."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199697915-e-36|title=Qualitative Methods and American Political Development|last=Galvin|first=Daniel J.|date=2015-07-09|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199697915.013.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodologically, the subfield tends to use within-case analysis and conduct causes-of-effects research (as opposed to effects-of-causes research).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Major journals in the subfield include the flagship journal ''[[Studies in American Political Development]]'', founded in 1986, and ''The Journal of Political History'', founded in 1989. As of 2005, the Politics and History section (founded in 1989) of the [[American Political Science Association]] was the eighth-largest in membership out of 35 total sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/section24|title= MEMBERSHIP &gt; Organized Sections by Title &gt; Politics and History (Section 24)|website=American Political Science Association|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement predominantly centered around Paris, France, and Italy, with some offshoots in England, Germany, and North America.

Some examples of animalier artists and their subjects are [[George Stubbs]] and [[Jules Moigniez]] (paintings and sculpture of horses), [[Antoine Barye|Antoine-Louis Barye]] (sculpture of bulls and humans), and [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (felines, human figures, and zoo animals).

== History ==

Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1094-2|pages=81‚Äì82|edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Germanic culture|Germanic]] animal style with its "combination of abstract and organic shapes, of formal discipline and imaginative freedom, became an important element ... in the art of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H.W.|last2=Janson|first2=Anthony F.|title=History of art : a survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day|date=1986|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1094-2|pages=255‚Äì256|edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Baroque]] period in France and England, a 1670 commissioned [[terracotta]] model for a sculpture of [[Louis XIV]] titled ''Equestrian Statue of Louis XIV'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] was rejected on the grounds that it was not suitable to the dignity of the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janson|first1=H.W.|title=History of art: a survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day|date=1986|publisher=H.N.

The term animalier was first used by the French press and [[Salon (Paris)|salon]] jurors, often as a derogatory term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallery|first1=The Bronze|title=Les Animaliers - The 19th century French movement of Bronze Sculpture|url=http://bronze-gallery.com/info/info.cfm?infoID=9|website=bronze-gallery.com|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but with the opening of the new [[Jardin des Plantes|Paris Jardin des Plantes]] zoo and the [[M√©nagerie du Jardin des plantes]], interest in animal art increased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Dukes of [[Duke of Orl√©ans|Orleans]], [[Duke of Luynes|Luynes]], [[Duke of Montpensier|Montpensier]], and [[Duke of Nemours|Nemours]] were soon to become Barye's patrons. In 1882 [[Edouard Manet]] created a portrait in pastel on canvas of the animalier artist Julien de La Rochenoire, which has been owned by the [[Getty Museum]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/265936/edouard-manet-portrait-of-julien-de-la-rochenoire-french-1882/&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project]] The art of George Stubbs became a favorite of collector [[Paul Mellon]], who donated many of Stubbs' paintings to the [[Yale Center for British Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maj|first1=Yale Center for British Art, Lec|title=Zebra|url=http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1669240|website=collections.britishart.yale.edu|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "many animal sculptures were modeled in plaster for exhibition and cast later in bronze editions. The size and variety of an edition depended on the popularity of the piece at exhibition, and many Barye, M√™ne, and Fratin pieces were so popular that they were cast in very large editions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Metz Collection|url=http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html|website=www.iub.edu|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animalier artists ==
[[File:Rembrandt bugatti zoo antwerpen 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp, Belgium]]Artists of the animalier movement were referred to as ''[[les animaliers]]''. Important artists of the animalier movement included [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] (1796‚Äì1875), [[Rembrandt Bugatti]] (1884‚Äì1916), [[George Stubbs]] (1724‚Äì1806), [[Alfred Dedreux]] (1810‚Äì1860), [[Christopher Fratin]] (1801‚Äì1864),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=21
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/concise-history-of-bronzes/oclc/15625
&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandre Guionnet, [[Pierre-Jules M√™ne]] (1810‚Äì1879).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Mene%2C+Pierre-Jules
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosa Bonheur]] (1822‚Äì1899), [[Isidore Bonheur]] (1827‚Äì1901), [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]] (1876‚Äì1973), [[Paul-Edouard Delabrierre]] (1829‚Äì1912), [[Alfred Dubucand]] (1828‚Äì1894), [[Jules Moigniez]] (1835‚Äì1894) and [[√âmile-Coriolan Guillemin]] (1841‚Äì1907).

== Animalier reproductions ==
Many beautiful [[replicas]] are made of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as [[cast iron]], [[spelter]], or [[cast bronze]], as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional [[lost wax]] process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auguste Cain.  Expert art authentication, certificates of authenticity and expert art appraisals - Art Experts|url=https://www.artexpertswebsite.com/pages/artists/cain.php|website=www.artexpertswebsite.com|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was exceptional in that he worked in wood. Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use [[patinated]] [[verdigris]] cast bronze or iron, or [[Resin casting|bonded marble resin]] (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with resin glue), as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of [[Capiz]] [[placuna placenta]] oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the [[Philippines]] (where they are known as ''kapiz'').{{clear}}

Along these lines, one can see the biosphere ‚Äî the [[earth]] as it is affected by the [[human]] ‚Äî as the adaptation of the natural to the human and biocultures as the inter-adaptation of the human to the new technologies and ways of knowing characterized by the 21st century‚Äôs attitude toward the [[Human body|body]]. It assumes that in bioculture there's a diverse way to know the workings of the body and mind, and that these are primarily culturally derived, and an expert's way of knowing produces specific strong results. However the results do not have an exclusive purview over the body and [[mind]]. Plus it seeks to develop and encourage not only the experts but also parts of people's bodies and minds as the subject of study.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd B, "Getting it all wrong - Bioculture critiques cultural critique" American Scholar  75 (4): 18-30 Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melby MK, Smith EO "PMS: A bioculture-bound syndrome."

An alternative definition of the term bioculture is all the practical aspects of the use of [[living things in culture]], including agriculture, production of food and clothing, forestry, animal breeding and training, the pet trade, use of living things in science, zoos and aquariums, animal sports, and the raising of game for sport hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Paul W. |title=Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics |edition=25th Anniversary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TdcnC98eRwC&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=1-4008-3853-3 |pages=53‚Äì54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Christian interpolation''' is a subsidiary category of [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|scribal interpolation in manuscript transmission]]. In [[textual criticism]] the term generally refers to the specific phenomena of textual insertion and textual damage to Jewish sources text during Christian scribal transmission, but may also refer to possible interpolation in secular Roman texts, such as the case of [[Tacitus on Christ]].

==Josephus==
{{main|Josephus on Jesus}}
Notable disputed examples in the works of [[Josephus]] include Josephus' sections on [[John the Baptist]], which is widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;John the Baptizer and Prophet: A Sociohistorical Study - Page 39 1597529869 Robert L. Webb - 2006 "2.3 The Authenticity of Ant. 18.116-19 The authenticity of Josephus' narrative concerning John the Baptist has often been critically examined. While a few have rejected it as a Christian interpolation, most schoLars have accepted it."&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Jesus of Nazareth]], which is widely regarded as at best damaged.&lt;ref&gt; Josephus: The Essential Writings - Page 265  Paul L. Maier - 1990 "scholars have long suspected a Christian interpolation, since Josephus would not have believed Jesus to be the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament pseudepigrapha==
Notable examples among the body of texts known as [[List of Old Testament pseudepigrapha|Old Testament pseudepigrapha]] include the disputed authenticity of [[Similitudes of Enoch]] and [[4 Ezra]] which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as [[Son of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Nickelsburg, ‚ÄúSon of Man.‚Äú in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]] 6.138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Enoch-Metatron Tradition - Page 82 3161485440 Andrei A. Orlov - 2005 "The same interchangeability is observable in the titles ‚Äúson of man‚Äú and ‚Äúchosen one.‚Äù Here ... 88 Some scholars believe that these chapters might represent later interpolation(s) and do not '83 G. Nickelsburg, ‚ÄúSon of Man.‚Äú ABD 6.138."&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]],&lt;ref&gt; The Lamb Christology of the Apocalypse of John Page 87 316148164X Loren L. Johns - 2003 " 2.2 Testament of Benjamin 3:8 The same sort of Christian interpolation is evident in Testament of Benjamin 3:8, where, according to Howard Clark Kee, "the major text traditions include a Christian interpolation."53"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sibylline Oracles]] and so on.

'''Cold and heat adaptations in humans''' are a part of the broad adaptability of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Adaptations in humans can be [[Physiological adaptations|physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], or [[Culture|cultural]], which allow people to live in a wide variety of [[climate]]s. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, [[acclimatization]], and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures.

The human body always works to remain in [[homeostasis]]. One form of homeostasis is [[thermoregulation]]. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (98.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767567894|title=Harrison's online|last=1949-|first=Longo, Dan L. (Dan Louis),|last2=1900-1978.|first2=Harrison, Tinsley Randolph,|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=767567894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress from extreme external temperature can cause the human body to shut down. [[Hypothermia]] can set in when the core temperature drops to 35&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (95&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Douglas J.A.|last2=Brugger|first2=Hermann|last3=Boyd|first3=Jeff|last4=Paal|first4=Peter|date=2012-11-15|title=Accidental Hypothermia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra1114208|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=367|issue=20|pages=1930‚Äì1938|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1114208|issn=0028-4793|pmid=23150960}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperthermia]] can set in when the core body temperature rises above 37.5-38.3&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (99.5-100.9&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=Yekaterina K.|last2=Diringer|first2=Michael N.|title=Temperature Management in Acute Neurologic Disorders|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0733861908000236|journal=Neurologic Clinics|volume=26|issue=2|pages=585‚Äì603|doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laupland|first=Kevin B.|title=Fever in the critically ill medical patient|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181aa6117|journal=Critical Care Medicine|volume=37|issue=Supplement|pages=S273‚ÄìS278|doi=10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181aa6117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperatures commonly result in mortality. Humans have adapted to living in these extreme climates primarily through culture and technology, such as the use of clothing and shelter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daanen|first=Hein A.

== Origin of cold and heat adaptations ==
Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Evidence suggests that modern culture may have originated then, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Richard G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Archeology and the evolution of human behavior|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=17‚Äì36|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans spread into Europe and outcompeted [[Neanderthal]]s, which suggests that early modern humans were adaptable enough to live in various climates. This is supported in the variability selection hypothesis proposed by Richard Potts, which says that human adaptability came from environmental change over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998-01-01|title=Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=107|issue=S27|pages=93‚Äì136|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecogeographic rules ===
[[Bergmann's rule|Bergmann‚Äôs rule]] states that [[endotherm]]ic animal subspecies living in colder climates have larger bodies than that of the subspecies living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1953-08-01|title=The Application of Ecological Rules to the Racial Anthropology of the Aboriginal New World*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=311‚Äì327|doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with larger bodies are better suited for colder climates because larger bodies produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann‚Äôs rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Frederick|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|date=2013-08-28|title=A Reassessment of Bergmann's Rule in Modern Humans|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e72269|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3756069|pmid=24015229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen's rule|Allen‚Äôs rule]] is a biological rule that says the limbs of an endotherm is either shorter in cold climates or longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body‚Äôs surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Trenton W.|last2=Hilton|first2=Charles E.|date=2010-06-01|title=Body proportions of circumpolar peoples as evidenced from skeletal data: Ipiutak and Tigara (Point Hope) versus Kodiak Island Inuit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21226/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=142|issue=2|pages=287‚Äì302|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21226|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall T. Newman argues that this can be observed in [[Eskimo]], who have shorter limbs than other people and are laterally built.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1961-06-01|title=Biological Adaptation of Man to His Environment: Heat, Cold, Altitude, and Nutrition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=617‚Äì633|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological adaptations ==
{{main|Thermoregulation in humans}}
Ambient air temperature affects how much energy investment the human body must make. The temperature that requires the least amount of energy investment is 21&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (69.8&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body controls its temperature through the [[hypothalamus]]. [[Thermoreceptor]]s in the skin send signals to the hypothalamus, which indicate when [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]] should occur.

=== Cold ===
The human body has two methods of [[thermogenesis]], which produces heat to raise the core body temperature. The first is [[shivering]], which occurs in an unclothed person when the ambient air temperature is under 25&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (77&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26763611|title=Human adaptation and accommodation|last=1939-|first=Frisancho, A. Roberto,|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|oclc=26763611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is limited by the amount of [[glycogen]] available in the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second is non-shivering, which occurs in [[brown adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890013690.pdf|title=Acclimatization to cold in humans|last=Kaciuba-Uscilko|first=Hannah|last2=Greenleaf|first2=John|date=April 1, 1989|website=ntrs.nasa.gov/|publisher=United States|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heat ===
The only mechanism the human body has to cool itself is by [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sweating occurs when the ambient air temperatures is above 28&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (82&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) and the body fails to return to the normal internal temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The evaporation of the sweat helps cool the blood beneath the skin. It is limited by the amount of water available in the body, which can cause dehydration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Acclimatization ===
When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cold ====
The [[Inuit]] have more blood flowing into their extremities, and at a hotter temperature, than people living in warmer climates. A 1960 study on the [[Alacalufe people|Alacaluf Indians]] shows that they have a resting metabolic rate 150 to 200 percent higher than the white controls used. [[Sami people|Lapps]] do not have an increase in metabolic rate when sleeping, unlike non-acclimated people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]] undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Heat ====
Humans in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for at least 40,000 years, which means that they have similar thermoregulatory systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study done on the [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] of South Africa showed that Bantus have a lower sweat rate than that of acclimated and nonacclimated whites. A similar study done on Australian aborigines produced similar results, with aborigines having a much lower sweat rate than whites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Culture ==
Social adaptations enabled early modern humans to occupy environments with temperatures that were drastically different from that of Africa. (Potts 1998). Culture enabled humans to expand their range to areas that would otherwise be uninhabitable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Cold ===
Humans have been able to occupy areas of extreme cold through clothing, buildings, and manipulation of fire. [[Furnace]]s have further enabled the occupation of cold environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Australian aborigines only wear genital coverings for clothes, but studies have shown that the warmth from the fires they build is enough to keep the body from fighting heat loss through shivering.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eskimos use well-insulated houses that are designed to transfer heat from an energy source to the living area, which means that the average indoor temperature for coastal Eskimos is 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (50-68&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Heat ===
Humans inhabit hot climates, both dry and [[Humidity|humid]], and have done so for thousands of years. Selective use of clothing and technological inventions such as [[air conditioning]] allows humans to thrive in hot climates.

One example is the [[Bedouin|Chaamba Arabs]], who live in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. They wear clothing that traps air in between skin and the clothes, preventing the high ambient air temperature from reaching the skin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Genetic adaptations ==
There has been very little research done in the genetics behind adaptations to heat and cold stress. Data suggests that certain parts of the [[human genome]] have only been [[Natural selection|selected]] for recently. Research on gene-culture interaction has been successful in linking agriculture and [[lactose]] tolerance. However, most evidence of links between culture and selection has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=John|last3=Myles|first3=Sean|title=How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2734|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137‚Äì148|doi=10.1038/nrg2734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational sustainability''' is a broad field that attempts to optimize societal, economic, and environmental resources using methods from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computational-sustainability.org/|title=www.computational-sustainability.org|website=www.computational-sustainability.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainability]] in this context is the ability to produce enough energy for the world to support its biological systems.  Using the power of computers to process large quantities of information, decision making algorithms allocate resources based on real-time information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unknown|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf?ip=73.234.206.61&amp;id=1562174&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E6D218144511F3437&amp;CFID=594460368&amp;CFTOKEN=33596010&amp;__acm__=1458873213_60e5758f5509c54d6c6abc8c305ffbc8|doi=10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are widespread. [[Smart grid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s implement renewable resources and storage capabilities to control the production and expenditure of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compsust.net/|title=CompSustNet: Home|website=www.compsust.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligent transportation system]] analyze road conditions and relay information to drivers so they can make smarter decisions based on real time traffic information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero-ibanez|first=J. A.|last2=Zeadally|first2=S.|last3=Contreras-Castillo|first3=J.|date=2015-12-01|title=Integration challenges of intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicle, cloud computing, and internet of things technologies|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7368833|journal=IEEE Wireless Communications|volume=22|issue=6|pages=122‚Äì128|doi=10.1109/MWC.2015.7368833|issn=1536-1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. [[Data collection]] can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a [[mobile app]], like [[Waze]], to report its whereabouts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44160-2_5|title=Transportation Systems: Monitoring, Control, and Security|last=Timotheou|first=Stelios|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Christos G.|last3=Polycarpou|first3=Marios M.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783662441596|editor-last=Kyriakides|editor-first=Elias|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|pages=125‚Äì166|language=en|editor-last2=Polycarpou|editor-first2=Marios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders.  Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their [[smart card]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at stations and online.  APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones.  Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are.  [[Ramp meter]]s regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups.  Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the number of cars on the road.  Electronic highway signs relay information regarding travel times, detours, and accidents that may affect drivers ability to reach their destination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the rise of consumer connectivity, less infrastructure is needed for these ITS to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/shift-to-constant-connectivity.html|title=The Shift to Constant Connectivity|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google Maps]] uses smartphone crowdsourcing to get information about real-time traffic conditions allowing motorists to make decisions based on toll roads, travel times, and overall distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/how-google-tracks-traffic/|title=How Google Tracks Traffic|website=www.ncta.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars communicate with their manufacturers to remotely install software updates when new features are added or bugs are being patched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/wireless-updates-to-core-automotive-functions-could-spell-privacy-troubles/|title=Your next car will update itself while you sleep, and maybe watch you too|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tesla Motors]] even uses these updates to increase their cars efficiency and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11378880/Tesla-software-update-did-your-car-just-get-faster.html|title=Tesla software update: did your car just get faster?|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections give ITS a means to accurately collect information and even relay that information to drivers with no other infrastructure needed.

Future ITS systems will aid in car communication with not just the infrastructure, but with other cars as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Utilities ==
The [[electrical grid]] was designed to send consumers electricity from [[Electric generator|electricity generators]] for a monthly fee based on usage. Homeowners are installing [[solar panel]]s and large batteries to store the power created by these panels.  A [[smart grid]] is being created to accommodate the new energy sources.  Rather than just electricity being sent to a household to be consumed by the various appliances in the home, electricity can flow in either direction.  Additional sensors along the grid will improve information collection and decreased downtime during power outages. These sensors can also relay information directly to consumers about how much energy they're using and what the costs will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/fa14-solar-power-on-the-rise.html#.VwbE4hMrKu4|title=Solar Power on the Rise|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIAM promoted  [[modern architecture]] in the "Cubist style": the [[Bauhaus]], [[Weissenhof Estate|Weissenhof]], [[De Stijl]], and modern projects of the [[Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]]. Parallel movements of the 1920s include [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|Traditionalism]].]]

The '''Congr√®s internationaux d'architecture moderne''' (CIAM), or International Congresses of [[Modern Architecture]], was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the [[Modern architecture|Modern Movement]] focusing in all the main domains of architecture (such as landscape, urbanism, industrial design, and many others).

==Formation and membership==

The International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) was founded in June 1928, at the Chateau de [[la Sarraz]] in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by [[Le Corbusier]], H√©l√®ne de Mandrot (owner of the castle), and [[Sigfried Giedion]] (the first secretary-general). CIAM was one of many 20th century [[manifesto]]s meant to advance the cause of "architecture as a social art".

Other founder members included [[Karl Moser]] (first president), [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Hendrik Berlage]], [[Victor Bourgeois]], [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Gabriel Guevrekian]], Max Ernst Haefeli, [[Hugo H√§ring]], Arnold H√∂chel, Huib Hoste, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (cousin of Le Corbusier), [[Andr√© Lur√ßat]], [[Ernst May]], [[Max Cetto]], Fernando Garc√≠a Mercadal, [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Werner M. Moser]], Carlo Enrico Rava, [[Gerrit Rietveld]], Alberto Sartoris, Hans Schmidt, [[Mart Stam]], Rudolf Steiger, Szymon Syrkus, Henri-Robert Von der M√ºhll, and Juan de Zavala. The Soviet delegates were to be [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Kolli]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], although at the Sarraz conference they were unable to obtain visas.

Other later members included [[Minnette de Silva]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Uno √Öhr√©n]], [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] (1929) and [[Fred Forb√°t]]. In 1941, [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]] was chosen as secretary of the American branch of CIAM, which was the Chapter for Relief and Post War Planning, founded in [[New York City]].

[[Josep Llu√≠s Sert]], co-founder of [[GATEPAC]] and [[GATCPAC]] (in [[Saragossa|Saragoza]] and [[Barcelona]], respectively) in 1930, as well as ADLAN (Friends of New Art) in Barcelona in 1932, participated in the congresses as of 1929, and served as CIAM president from 1947 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C4uNElGkBoYC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=CIAM+1929+Sert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhCO-MI962&amp;sig=tWngBDDQgFw4flUp-TWeg9d851k&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6sMU8-cL_OZ0AXAj4FQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=CIAM%201929%20Sert&amp;f=false "The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960"], by Eric Paul Mumford.

==Influence==

The organization was hugely influential. It was not only engaged in formalizing the architectural principles of the Modern Movement, but also saw architecture as an economic and political tool that could be used to improve the world through the design of buildings and through [[urban planning]].

The fourth CIAM meeting in 1933 was to have been held in Moscow. The rejection of Le Corbusier's competition entry for the [[Palace of the Soviets]], a watershed moment and an indication that the Soviets had abandoned CIAM's principles, changed those plans. Instead it was held onboard ship, the SS Patris II, which sailed from [[Marseille]] to [[Athens]].

Here the group discussed the principles of "The Functional City", which broadened CIAM's scope from architecture into urban planning. Based on an analysis of thirty-three cities, CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals. These proceedings went unpublished from 1933 until 1943, when Le Corbusier, acting alone, published them in heavily edited form as the "[[Athens Charter]]."

As CIAM members traveled worldwide after the war, many of its ideas spread outside Europe, notably to the USA. The city planning ideas were adopted in the rebuilding of Europe following [[World War II]], although by then some CIAM members had their doubts. [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] were chief among the dissenters. When implemented in the postwar period, many of these ideas were compromised by tight financial constraints, poor understanding of the concepts, or popular resistance. [[Mart Stam]]'s replanning of postwar Dresden in the CIAM formula was rejected by its citizens as an "all-out attack on the city."

The CIAM organization disbanded in 1959 as the views of the members diverged. Le Corbusier had left in 1955, objecting to the increasing use of English during meetings.

For a reform of CIAM, the group [[Team 10]] was active from 1953 onwards, and two different movements emerged from it: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members ([[Aldo van Eyck]] and [[Jacob B. Bakema]]).

==CIRPAC==
The elected executive body of CIAM was CIRPAC, the ''Comit√© international pour la r√©solution des probl√®mes de l‚Äôarchitecture contemporaine'' (International Committee for the Resolution of Problems in Contemporary Architecture).

==Conferences==

'''Cross-cultural communication''' is a field of study that looks at how people from differing [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to [[communication|communicate]] across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/home/default.aspx Japan Intercultural Consulting]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and culture==
During the [[Cold War]], the economy of the United States was largely self-contained because the world was polarized into two separate and competing powers: the [[Eastern Bloc|East]] and the [[Western Bloc|West]]. However, changes and advancements in economic relationships, political systems, and technological options began to break down old cultural barriers. Business transformed from individual-country capitalism to [[Globalization#Modern|global capitalism]]. Thus, the study of cross-cultural communication was originally found within businesses and government, both seeking to expand globally. Businesses began to offer [[Language education|language training]] to their employees and programs were developed to train employees to understand how to act when abroad.  With this also came the development of the [[Foreign Service Institute]], or FSI, through the [[Foreign Service Act]] of 1946, where government employees received training and prepared for overseas posts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, William B. Hart, &amp; Yoshitaka Miike (2002). Edward T. Hall and The History of Intercultural Communication: The United States and Japan. Keio Communication Review No. 24, 1-5. Accessible at http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2002/review24/2.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; There began also implementation of a ‚Äú[[world view]]‚Äù perspective in the curriculum of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 44, 48, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1974, the [[International Progress Organization]], with the support of [[UNESCO]] and under the auspices of [[Senegal]]ese President [[L√©opold S√©dar Senghor]], held an international conference on "The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations" ([[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], 27‚Äì29 July 1974) which called upon [[United Nations]] member states "to organize systematic and global comparative research on the different cultures of the world" and "to make all possible efforts for a more intensive training of diplomats in the field of international cultural co-operation ... and to develop the cultural aspects of their foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans K√∂chler]] (ed.), Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations. T√ºbingen: Erdmann, 1978, {{ISBN|978-3-7711-0311-8}}, Final Resolution, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has become an increasing pressure for universities across the world to incorporate intercultural and international understanding and knowledge into the education of their students. &lt;ref&gt;Deardorff, D. K. (2015). A 21st Century Imperative: integrating intercultural competence in Tuning. Tuning Journal for Higher Education, 3(1), 137‚Äì147. https://doi.org/10.18543/tjhe-3(1)-2015pp137-147
&lt;/ref&gt; International literacy and cross-cultural understanding have become critical to a country‚Äôs cultural, technological, economic, and political health. It has become essential for universities to educate, or more importantly, ‚Äútransform‚Äù, to function effectively and comfortably in a world characterized by close, multi-faceted relationships and permeable borders. Students must possess a certain level of global competence to understand the world they live in and how they fit into this world. This level of global competence starts at ground level- the university and its faculty- with how they generate and transmit cross-cultural knowledge and information to students.&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interdisciplinary orientation ==
Cross-cultural communication endeavors to bring together the relatively unrelated fields of [[cultural anthropology]] with established areas of communication. At its core, cross-cultural communication involves understanding the ways in which culturally distinct individuals communicate with each other. Its charge is to also produce some guidelines with which people from different cultures can better communicate with each other.

Cross-cultural communication requires an interdisciplinary approach. It involves literacy in fields such as [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]] and communication. The field has also moved both toward the treatment of interethnic relations, and toward the study of communication strategies used by [[co-cultural populations]], i.e., communication strategies used to deal with majority or mainstream populations.

The study of languages other than one's own can serve not only to help one understand what we as humans have in common, but also to assist in the understanding of the diversity which underlines our languages' methods of constructing and organizing knowledge. Such understanding has profound implications with respect to developing a critical awareness of social relationships. Understanding social relationships and the way other cultures work is the groundwork of successful globalization business affairs.

Language socialization can be broadly defined as ‚Äúan investigation of how language both presupposes and creates anew, social relations in cultural context‚Äù.&lt;ref name="Rymes"&gt;Rymes, (2008). Language Socialization and the Linguistic Anthropology of Education. Encyclopedia of Language and Education, 2(8, Springer)&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative that the speaker understands the grammar of a language, as well as how elements of language are socially situated in order to reach communicative competence. Human experience is culturally relevant, so elements of language are also culturally relevant.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  One must carefully consider semiotics and the evaluation of sign systems to compare cross-cultural norms of communication.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|4}} There are several potential problems that come with language socialization, however. Sometimes people can over-generalize or label cultures with stereotypical and subjective characterizations. Another primary concern with documenting alternative cultural norms revolves around the fact that no social actor uses language in ways that perfectly match normative characterizations.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|8}} A methodology for investigating how an individual uses language and other semiotic activity to create and use new models of conduct and how this varies from the cultural norm should be incorporated into the study of language socialization.&lt;ref name="Rymes" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

== Global rise ==
With increasing [[globalization]] and international trade, it is unavoidable that different cultures will meet, conflict, and blend together. People from different culture find it is difficult to communicate not only due to language barriers, but also are affected by culture styles.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/#facts-and-figures| title=Fact and Figure about cross cultural training.| accessdate=3 December 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[individualistic culture]]s, such as in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, an independent figure or self is dominant. This independent figure is characterized by a sense of self relatively distinct from others and the environment. In [[Self-enhancement#Culture|interdependent cultures]], usually identified as Asian, Latin American, African, and Southern European cultures, an interdependent figure of self is dominant. There is a much greater emphasis on the interrelatedness of the individual to others and the environment; the self is meaningful only (or primarily) in the context of social relationships, duties, and roles. In some degree, the effect brought by cultural difference override the language gap. This culture style difference contributes to one of the biggest challenges for cross-culture communication. Effective communication with people of different cultures is especially challenging. Cultures provide people with ways of thinking‚Äîways of seeing, hearing, and interpreting the world. Thus the same words can mean different things to people from different cultures, even when they speak the "same" language. When the languages are different, and translation has to be used to communicate, the potential for misunderstandings increases. The study of cross-cultural communication is a global research area.  As a result, cultural differences in the ''study'' of cross-cultural communication can already be found.  For example, cross-cultural communication is generally considered part of [[communication studies]] in the US, but is emerging as a sub-field of [[applied linguistics]] in the UK.

The application of cross-cultural communication theory to foreign language education is increasingly appreciated around the world. Cross-cultural communication classes can now be found within foreign language departments of some universities, while other schools are placing cross-cultural communication programs in their departments of education.

With the increasing pressures and opportunities of globalization, the incorporation of international networking alliances has become an ‚Äúessential mechanism for the internationalization of higher education‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Teather, D. (2004). The networking alliance: A mechanism for the internationalisation of higher education? Managing Education Matters, 7(2), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities from around the world have taken great strides to increase intercultural understanding through processes of organizational change and innovations. In general, university processes revolve around four major dimensions which include: organizational change, curriculum innovation, staff development, and student mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Rudzki, R. E. J. (1995). The application of a strategic management model to the internationalization of higher education institutions. Higher Education, 29(4), 421-422.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellingboe emphasizes these four major dimensions with his own specifications for the internationalization process. His specifications include: (1) college leadership; (2) faculty members' international involvement in activities with colleagues, research sites, and institutions worldwide; (3) the availability, affordability, accessibility, and transferability of study abroad programs for students; (4) the presence and integration of international students, scholars, and visiting faculty into campus life; and (5) international co-curricular units (residence halls, conference planning centers, student unions, career centers, cultural immersion and language houses, student activities, and student organizations).&lt;ref name="Bartell, M. 2003"/&gt;

Above all, universities need to make sure that they are open and responsive to changes in the outside environment. In order for internationalization to be fully effective, the university (including all staff, students, curriculum, and activities) needs to be current with cultural changes, and willing to adapt to these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, K.S. (1984). Organizational adaptation and higher education. Journal of Higher Education 55(2), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Ellingboe, internationalization ‚Äúis an ongoing, future-oriented, multidimensional, interdisciplinary, leadership-driven vision that involves many stakeholders working to change the internal dynamics of an institution to respond and adapt appropriately to an increasingly diverse, globally focused, ever-changing external environment".&lt;ref&gt;Ellingboe, B.J. (1998). Divisional strategies to internationalize a campus portrait: Results, resistance, and recommendations from a case study at a U.S. university, in Mestenhauser, J.A. and Ellingboe, B.J (eds.), Reforming the Higher Education Curriculum: Internationalizing the Campus. Phoenix, AZ: American Council on Education and Oryx Press, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; New distance learning technologies, such as interactive teleconferencing, enable students located thousands of miles apart to communicate and interact in a virtual classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bartell, M. (2003). Internationalization of universities: A university culture-based framework. Higher Education, 45(1), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has indicated that certain themes and images such as children, animals, life cycles, relationships, and sports can transcend cultural differences, and may be used in international settings such as traditional and online university classrooms to create common ground among diverse cultures (Van Hook, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, S.R. (2011, 11 April). Modes and models for transcending cultural differences in international classrooms. Journal of Research in International Education, 10(1), 5-27. http://jri.sagepub.com/content/10/1/5&lt;/ref&gt;

The main theories for cross-cultural communication are based on the work done looking at value differences between different cultures, especially the works of [[Edward T. Hall]], [[Richard D. Lewis]], [[Geert Hofstede]], and [[Fons Trompenaars]]. [[Clifford Geertz]] was also a contributor to this field. Also Jussi V. Koivisto's model on cultural crossing in internationally operating organizations elaborates from this base of research.

These theories have been applied to a variety of different communication theories and settings, including general business and management ([[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]]) and marketing ([[Marieke de Mooij]], [[Stephan Dahl]]). There have also been several successful educational projects which concentrate on the practical applications of these theories in cross-cultural situations.

These theories have also been criticized mainly by management scholars (e.g. [[Nigel Holden]]) for being based on the culture concept derived from 19th century cultural anthropology and emphasizing on culture-as-difference and culture-as-essence. Another criticism has been the uncritical way [[Hofstede]]‚Äôs dimensions are served up in textbooks as facts ([[Peter W. Cardon]]). There is a move to focus on 'cross-cultural interdependence' instead of the traditional views of comparative differences and similarities between cultures. Cross-cultural management is increasingly seen as a form of [[knowledge management]]. While there is debate in academia, over what cross-cultural teams can do in practice, a meta-analysis by [[G√ºnter Stahl]], [[Martha Maznevski]], [[Andreas Voigt]] and [[Karsten Jonsen]] on research done on multicultural groups, concluded "Research suggests that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=G√ºnter|last2=Maznevski|first2=Martha|last3=Voigt|first3=Andreas|last4=Jonsen|first4=Karsten|title=Unraveling the Effects of Cultural Diversity in Teams: A Meta-Analysis of Research on Multicultural Work Groups|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=May 2010|volume=41|issue=4|pages=690‚Äì709|jstor=40604760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Master of Science in Management]] programs have an internationalization specialization which may place a focus on cross-cultural communication. For example, the [[Ivey Business School]] has a course titled Cross Cultural Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross Cultural Management|url=https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/msc/courses/cross-cultural-management/|website=Ivey Business School|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross cultural communication gives opportunities to share ideas, experiences, and different perspectives and perception by interacting with local people.

==International educational organizations==

===WYSE International===

[[WYSE International]] is a worldwide educational charity specializing in education and development for emerging leaders established in 1989. It is a non-governmental organization associated with the [[Department of Public Information]] of the United Nations.

Over 3000 participants from 110 countries have attended their courses, they have run in 5 continents. Its flagship International Leadership Programme is a 12-day residential course for 30 people from on average 20 different countries (aged 18 ‚Äì 35).

WYSE International's website states its aims are to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"provide education independently of political, religious or social backgrounds and promote visionary leadership capable of responding to evolving world needs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wyse-ngo.org/ WYSE International website&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MEET - Middle East Education through Technology===

[[MEET - Middle East Education through Technology]] is an innovative educational initiative aimed at creating a common professional language between Israeli and Palestinian young leaders. Israeli and Palestinian students are selected through an application process and work in small bi-national teams to develop technology and business projects for local impact. Through this process of cross-cultural communication, students build mutual respect, cultural competence and understanding of each others.

==Aspects==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

There are several parameters that may be perceived differently by people of different cultures:

* High- and low-context cultures: context is the most important cultural dimension and also difficult to define. The idea of context in culture was advanced by the anthropologist Edward T Hall. He divides culture into two main groups: High and Low context cultures. He refers to context as the stimuli, environment or ambiance surrounding the environment.  Depending on how a culture relies on the three points to communicate their meaning, will place them in either high or low- context cultures. For example, Hall goes on to explain that low-context cultures assume that the individuals know very little about what they are being told, and therefore must be given a lot of background information. High-context cultures assume the individual is knowledgeable about the subject and has to be given very little background information.
* Nonverbal, oral and written: the main goal behind improving intercultural audiences is to pay special attention to specific areas of communication to enhance the effectiveness of the intercultural messages. The specific areas are broken down into three sub categories: nonverbal, oral and written messages.

Nonverbal contact involves everything from something as obvious as eye contact and facial expressions to more discreet forms of expression such as the use of space. Experts have labeled the term [[kinesics]] to mean communicating through body movement. Huseman, author of ''Business Communication'', explains that the two most prominent ways of communication through kinesics are eye contact and facial expressions.

Eye contact, Huseman goes on to explain, is the key factor in setting the tone between two individuals and greatly differs in meaning between cultures. In the Americas and Western Europe, eye contact is interpreted the same way, conveying interest and honesty. People who avoid eye contact when speaking are viewed in a negative light, withholding information and lacking in general confidence. However, in the Middle East, Africa, and especially Asia, eye contact is seen as disrespectful and even challenging of one's authority. People who make eye contact, but only briefly, are seen as respectful and courteous. 

Facial expressions are their own language by comparison and universal throughout all cultures. Dale Leathers, for example, states that facial expression can communicate ten basic classes of meaning.

The final part to nonverbal communication lies in our gestures, and can be broken down into five subcategories:
* '''Emblems'''
Emblems refer to sign language (such as, thumbs up, one of the most recognized symbols in the world) 
* '''Illustrators''' 
Illustrators mimic what is spoken (such as gesturing how much time is left by holding up a certain number of fingers). 
* '''Regulators''' 
Regulators act as a way of conveying meaning through gestures (raising up a hand for instance indicates that one has a certain question about what was just said) and become more complicated since the same regulator can have different meanings across different cultures (making a circle with a hand, for instance, in the Americas means agreement, in Japan is symbolic for money, and in France conveys the notion of worthlessness). 
* '''Affect displays''' 
Affect displays reveal emotions such as happiness (through a smile) or sadness (mouth trembling, tears). 
* '''Adaptors'''
Adaptors are more subtle such as a yawn or clenching fists in anger.

The last nonverbal type of communication deals with communication through the space around people, or proxemics. Huseman goes on to explain that Hall identifies three types of space:
# Feature-fixed space: deals with how cultures arrange their space on a large scale, such as buildings and parks.  
# Semifixed feature space: deals with how space is arranged inside buildings, such as the placement of desks, chairs and plants.
# Informal space: the space and its importance, such as talking distance, how close people sit to one another and office space are all examples. A production line worker often has to make an appointment to see a supervisor, but the supervisor is free to visit the production line workers at will.

Oral and written communication is generally easier to learn, adapt and deal with in the business world for the simple fact that each language is unique. The one difficulty that comes into play is [[paralanguage]], how something is said.

==Differences between Western communication and traditional Indigenous communication==

According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]],{{qualify evidence}} Western conversational interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Australian Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7‚Äì9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Re Aedificatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Title page of 1550 edition, [[Florence]]]]

'''''De re aedificatoria''''' ('''''On the Art of Building''''') is a classic architectural treatise written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1443 and 1452.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Grayson, in ''Kunstkronik'' '''213''' (1960:359ff, and ''M√ºnchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst'' '''11''' (1960), demonstrated that the bulk of the composition was carried out between these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', it was the first theoretical book on the subject written in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and in 1485 it became the first printed book on architecture.  It was followed in 1486 with the first printed edition of Vitruvius.

[[File:L'architettura (1565) (14758258226).jpg|thumb|Plate from a 1565 edition, showing the plan of a [[basilica]]]]
{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art}}

Alberti's ''Ten Books'' consciously echoes Vitruvius's writing, but Alberti also adopts a critical attitude toward his predecessor. In his discussion, Alberti includes a wide variety of literary sources, including [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], presenting a concise version of the [[sociology]] of [[architecture]]. ''De re aedificatoria'' is subdivided into ten books and includes:

* Book One: ''Lineaments''
* Book Two: ''Materials''
* Book Three: ''Construction''
* Book Four: ''Public Works''
* Book Five: ''Works of Individuals''
* Book Six: ''Ornament''
* Book Seven: ''Ornament to Sacred Buildings''
* Book Eight: ''Ornament to Public Secular Buildings''
* Book Nine: ''Ornament to Private Buildings''
* Book Ten: ''Restoration of Buildings''

In his survey of desirable floor plans for sacred buildings‚Äî "temples" in his phrase‚ÄîAlberti begins with the ideal form of the circle, which is expressed in numerous examples of Nature. Nine ideal centrally-planned geometrical shapes are recommended for churches; besides the circle he lists the square, the hexagon, octagon, decagon and dodecagon, all derived from the circle, and, derived from the square, rectangles that exhibit the square and a half, square and a third and double square, all of which have enharmonic parallels in music. Chapels add  small geometric figures to the basic circles and polygons to give a great variety of floor plans, in which each geometrical figure retains its clear unity and simple ratios that bind all elements of the plans and elevations into a harmonic unity.

''De re aedificatoria'' remained the classic treatise on architecture from the 16th until the 18th century.

In [[classical scholarship]], the '''''editio princeps''''' ([[plural]]: ''editiones principes'') of a work is the first printed edition of the work, that previously had existed only in [[manuscript]]s, which could be circulated only after being copied by hand.

For example, the ''editio princeps'' of [[Homer]] is that of [[Demetrius Chalcondyles]], now thought to be from 1488. The most important texts of classical Greek and Roman authors were for the most part produced in ''editiones principes'' in the years on either side of 1500, following the invention of the [[printing press]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15‚Äì23, 61‚Äì73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases there were possibilities of partial publication, of publication first in translation (for example from Greek to Latin), and of a usage that simply equates with [[first edition]]. For a work with several strands of manuscript tradition that have diverged, such as ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''editio princeps'' is a less meaningful concept.

The term has long been extended by scholars to works not part of the Ancient Greek and Latin literatures. It is also used for legal works, and other significant documents.

These were increased to 236 letters in nine books with the publication of the Roman edition in 1490. Still missing was the tenth book, found by [[Giovanni Giocondo]] between 1495 and 1500 in the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]] near Paris. Giocondo made a transcription, as did briefly after another Italian, Pietro Leandro, who once returned from France gave his partial copy of the tenth book to Girolamo Avanzi who printed the new 46 letters in [[Verona]] in 1502. For an edition of all Pliny's letters it was necessary to wait 1508, when [[Aldus Manutius]] printed in Venice a complete edition taking advantage of the transcript and other Plinian manuscripts Giocondo had given him.&lt;ref name="MVA1155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGNV"&gt;{{it icon}} P.

|The priority issue is highly controversial. The Roman undated edition printed by [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim|Sweynheym and Pannartz]] should be have printed in c. 1470‚Äì1471 and is often thought to be the''editio princeps''; also, there is a Venetian edition that is possibly the first printed edition.&lt;ref&gt;J.

|rowspan=3|The first complete edition of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s philosophical works. Due to a confusion between the son and the father the volume also includes [[Seneca the Elder]]'s widely known epitomized version composed of excerpts from his ''Suasoriae et Controversiae''; the complete surviving text was printed in 1490 in Venice by [[Bernardinus de Cremona]] together with the younger Seneca. Also in the edition is [[Publilius Syrus]], whose ''Sententiae'' are in the so-called ''Proverbia Senecae''. The mistake was corrected in 1514 by [[Erasmus]] when the latter published in [[Southwark]] in 1514 an edition of Publilius that is generally considered to be the real ''editio princeps''. Erasmus was followed in [[Leipzig]] in 1550 by [[Georg Fabricius]], who also added twenty new sentences to the print.&lt;ref name="RA338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AG874"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. A. H.

|rowspan=5|Edited by [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles|Demetrius Chalcondyles]], the book was printed with the help of {{Interlanguage link multi|Demetrius Damilas|el|3=ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒîŒ±ŒºŒπŒªŒ¨œÇ}} that reelaborated the Greek types he had previously used in Milan. The editorial project was completed thanks to the financial support of [[Giovanni Acciaiuoli]] and the patronage of Neri and [[Bernardo de' Nerli]] ([[:it:Nerli|it]]) together with, the latter also author of an opening dedication to [[Piero the Unfortunate|Piero de' Medici]]. The edition included not only the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', but also the so-called ''Homeric Hymns'', the ''Batrachomyomachia'' and passages on Homer from works attributed to [[Plutarch]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Dio Chrysostom|Dio Cocceianus]]. As for the typography the volume has traditionally been attributed to the prolific printer Bartolomeo de' Libri, attribution denied by recent scholarship.

|This edition contains only 6 of Aeschylus' 7 surviving tragedies: missing is the ''Choephoroe''. This is because the manuscripts had fused ''Agamemnon'' and ''Choephoroe'', omitting lines 311-1066 of ''Agamemnon'', a mistake that was corrected for the first time in 1552 in the Venetian edition edited by [[Francesco Robortello|Franciscus Robortellus]]. The separation was not fully successful as the text was not correctly divided, leaving it to the 1557 Paris edition by [[Petrus Victorius]], printed with an appendix by Henricus Stephanus, to finally obtain an adequate edition of Aeschylus' plays.&lt;ref name="JL98-121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grafton10-411"&gt;A.

|A part of Book VI had been already printed in Venice in 1529 by Joannes Antonius de Sabio, edited by [[Janus Lascaris]] with his Latin translation incorporated. The 1530 edition, edited by [[Vincentius Opsopoeus]], only contained Books I‚ÄìV together with their Latin translation made by [[Niccol√≤ Perotti|Nicolaus Perottus]]. What survived of the rest of Polybius thanks to the ''excerpta antiqua'' of the other Books was first printed by Joannes Hervagius in Basel in 1549 together with a Latin translation by Wolfgang Musculus. Further Polybian excerpts came to light thanks to [[Fulvio Orsini|Fulvius Ursinus]] that in Antwerp in 1582 published [[Constantine VII|Constantinus Porphyrogenitus]]' ''Excerpta de legationibus''. All this additional material was incorporated in [[Isaac Casaubon]]'s 1609 Polybius Paris edition.&lt;ref name="catalogus7-171"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''Environmental soil science''' is the study of the interaction of humans with the [[pedosphere]] as well as critical aspects of the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Environmental [[soil science]] addresses both the fundamental and applied aspects of the field including: buffers and surface water quality, [[vadose zone]] functions, [[septic drain field]] site assessment and function, land treatment of [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[erosion]] control, [[soil contamination]] with metals and pesticides, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated soils, restoration of [[wetlands]], [[soil degradation]], [[nutrient management]], movement of viruses and bacteria in soils and waters, [[bioremediation]], application of [[molecular biology]] and [[genetic engineering]] to development of soil microbes that can degrade hazardous pollutants, [[land use]], [[global warming]], [[acid rain]], and the study of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] soils, such as [[terra preta]]. Much of the research done in environmental soil science is produced through the use of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Hongwei|last2=An|first2=Jing|last3=Wei|first3=Shuhe|last4=Gu|first4=Jian|last5=Liang|first5=Wenju|title=Spatial Patterns and Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Soils in a Resource-Exhausted City, Northeast China|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=2015|volume=10|issue=9|page=e0137694|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0137694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziadat|first1=Feras Mousa|last2=Yeganantham|first2=Dhanesh|last3=Shoemate|first3=David|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Raghavan|last5=Narasimhan|first5=Balaji|last6=Tech|first6=Jaclyn|title=Soil-Landscape Estimation and Evaluation Program (SLEEP) to predict spatial distribution of soil attributes for environmental modeling|journal=International Journal of Architectural and Biological Engineering|date=2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=158‚Äì172|doi=10.3965/j.ijabe.20150803.1270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">'''Gratification disorder''' (also known as "infantile masturbation", despite occurring in children as old as 10, or sometimes ''benign idiopathic infantile dyskinesia'') is a form of [[masturbation|masturbatory]] behavior that has often been mistaken for [[epilepsy]], abdominal pain, and [[Paroxysmal attacks|paroxysmal]] dystonia or dyskinesia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nechay A, Ross LM, Stephenson JB, O'Regan M |title=Gratification disorder ("infantile masturbation"): a review |journal=Arch.

Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding [[King Arthur]]), are usually classified as [[cultural heritage]] or [[legend]]s, because they do not show the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Knowing Teaching and Learning History, National and International Perspectives |last= Seixas |first= Peter |editor= Peter N.

Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state [[chronicle]], the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[Outline of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in university studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
The word ''history'' comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:·º±œÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±|·º±œÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|·º±œÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''histor√≠a''), meaning "inquiry", "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ§·Ω∞ Œñ·ø∑Œ± ·ºπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ±Œπ]]}}&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, Jos√©. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Per√¨ T√† Z√¥a Œóistor√≠ai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|·ºµœÉœÑœâœÅ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).

The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as ''historia'', meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". ''History'' was borrowed from Latin (possibly via [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Welsh]]) into [[Old English]] as ''st√¶r'' ('history, narrative, story'), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"&gt;"history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as Latin became [[Old French]] (and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), ''historia'' developed into forms such as ''istorie'', ''estoire'', and ''historie'', with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

It was from Anglo-Norman that ''history'' was borrowed into [[Middle English]], and this time the loan stuck. It appears in the thirteenth-century ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century, with an early attestation appearing in [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' of the 1390s (VI.1383): "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". In [[Middle English]], the meaning of ''history'' was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="OED Online. Oxford University Press 2014"/&gt;

With the [[Renaissance]], older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late sixteenth century, when he wrote about "[[Natural history|Natural History]]". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "history, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 9 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (Âè≤ vs. ËØå) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Whitney, (1889). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search ‚Äì 3.0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=17 September 2005 }}, "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the "true past").

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. {{ISBN|0-415-05682-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995). The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. {{ISBN|0-415-12346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA; has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830‚Äì1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and New Zealand [[MƒÅori people|MƒÅori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
[[File:Guicciardini M Francesco La Historia dItalia.jpg|thumb|left|The title page to ''La Historia d'Italia'']]
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, [[world view]], use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Historiography: Ancient, medieval, and modern'' (University of Chicago Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the twentieth century: From scientific objectivity to the postmodern challenge'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
{{unreferenced section| date= January 2016}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development‚Äîthat is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style="background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;"&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[author]]ship)?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[historical criticism]]; the fifth, [[textual criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC ‚Äì ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history". However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 BC ‚Äì ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at [[Causality|cause and effect]], rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author1=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C.  |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=978-0-88133-834-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145‚Äì90 BC), author of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''Shiji''). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[Secularity|secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias|systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

W. Akhtar (1997). "The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[Great Man theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[History of mentalities|histoire des mentalit√©s]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[Fran√ßois Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]] defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history}}
The [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;‚Äì in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist historiography]] was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail M. Krom, "From the Center to the Margin: the Fate of Marxism in Contemporary Russian Historiography," ''Storia della Storiografia'' (2012) Issue 62, pp 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillan Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period. [[Century|Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168‚Äì169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prehistoric periodisation====
The field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists, who have entirely different sets of tools and theories. The usual method for periodisation of the distant [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] past, in [[archaeology]] is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains. Here prehistory is divided into a series of "chapters" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Time|last=Lucas|first=Gavin|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0415311977|location=Oxon|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation. There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning.

Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through [[radiocarbon dating]] and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use. In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used. Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that "cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Living Landscape: Bronze Age Settlement Sites in the Dutch River Area (C. 2000-800 BC)|last=Arnoldussen|first=Stijn|publisher=Sidestone Press|year=2007|isbn=9789088900105|location=Leiden|pages=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[Geography|geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[Country|countries]], and [[City|cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. According to [[Jules Michelet]] in his book ''Histoire de France'' (1833), "without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Relations of History and Geography: Studies in England, France and the United States|last=Darby|first=Henry Clifford|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002|isbn=0859896994|location=Exeter|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization. There is also the case of climate, which historians like [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World history from early times to A D 2000|last=Rao|first=B.V.|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd.|year=2007|isbn=9788120731882|location=New Delhi|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat. The "new military history" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|History of religions}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]'', ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Cochrane |title=What Is Catholic Historiography? |journal=Catholic Historical Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=169‚Äì190 |jstor=25019673 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.&lt;ref&gt;For example see {{cite journal |first=Sofia Boesch |last=Gajano |first2=Tommaso |last2=Cali√≤ |title=Italian Religious Historiography in the 1990s |journal=Journal of Modern Italian Studies |year=1998 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=293‚Äì306 |jstor= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history'', is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date=30 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great Man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=978-0-582-48488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subfields====
The chief subfields of social history include:
* [[Demographic history]]
* [[History of education]]
* [[Ethnic history]]
* [[History of the family]]
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labour history]]
* [[Rural history]]
* [[Urban history]]
** [[American urban history]]
* [[Women's history]]
Smaller specialties include:
* [[History of childhood]]
* [[Gender history]]

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[History of art|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production ([[iconography]]).&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]]  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, "diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."&lt;ref&gt;Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'? British Foreign Policy 1789‚Äì1914'' (1988) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history|Business history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business history]]  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Amatori, and Geoffrey Jones, eds. ''Business History Around the World'' (2003) [https://www.questia.com/read/114846992 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
{{See also|History of the world|Universal history}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ainslie Embree]] and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History'', Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501050602/http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~world/|title=H-World - H-Net|website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[nonconformist]]s, and the otherwise forgotten people. The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the [[History Workshop Journal|History Workshop]] movement in Britain in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wade Matthews|title=The New Left, National Identity, and the Break-up of Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfmZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|pages=20‚Äì21|isbn=9789004253070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual history===
{{Main|Intellectual history|History of ideas}}
Intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Grafton |title=The History of Ideas: Precept and Practice, 1950‚Äì2000 and beyond |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=67 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=1‚Äì32 |url=http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Maryanne Cline |editor-last=Horowitz |title=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas |volume=6 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;David Glassberg, "Public history and the study of memory." ''The Public Historian'' (1996): 7-23. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events.They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources from the past and other various means such as place names. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. [[Chronicle]]rs and [[annals|annalists]], though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
{{see also|Ash heap of history}}
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[Judgment (law)|legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name="Curran2000p415"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

[[Pseudohistory]] is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==

===Scholarship vs teaching===
A major intellectual battle took place in Britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities. At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed. Professor [[Charles Harding Firth]], Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars. The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools, such as Manchester University, where [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] was professionalizing the History undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Roots, "Firth, Sir Charles Harding (1857‚Äì1936)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33137, Online; accessed 10 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reba Soffer, "Nation, duty, character and confidence: history at Oxford, 1850‚Äì1914." ''Historical Journal'' (1987) 30#01 pp: 77-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, scholarship was concentrated at the major PhD-producing universities, while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching. A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Donoghue, ''The Last Professors: The Corporate University and the Fate of the Humanities'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher'', (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the ''[[Nouvelle histoire]]'' as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers p√©dagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation p√©dagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis Fran√ßois, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
[[File:Historybooks.JPG|thumb|History books in a bookstore]]
In several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History'', Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |journal=International Affairs |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=365‚Äì370 |doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x|year = 2008|last1 = Wedgwood Benn|first1 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], especially the [[Southern United States|southern part]] history about [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[American Civil War]] are controversial topics. [[McGraw-Hill Education]] for example, was criticised for describing Africans brought to American plantations as "workers" instead of slaves in a textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Hauser|first2=Christine|date=5 October 2015|title=Texas Mother Teaches Textbook Company a Lesson on Accuracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal'', April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher'', February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone L√§ssig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‚Äòhumanities‚Äô as a  class or kind, distinct from the ‚Äôsciences‚Äô, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]‚Äôs ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty‚Äôs position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‚Äòfuzziness‚Äô. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‚Äòthe humanities‚Äô would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor‚Äôs degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon'''" ("In [[Ashkelon]]'s Black Whale") is a popular academic [[commercium song]]. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many German speaking ancient universities. [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] provided the lyrics under the title '''''Altassyrisch''''' ([[Assyria|Old Assyrian]]) 1854, the melody is from 1783 or earlier&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lieder-archiv.de/im_schwarzen_walfisch_zu_askalon-notenblatt_600700.html Lieder-Archiv (de) (Song Archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Content ==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the [[bacchanalia]]n mayhem of student life, similar as in [[Gaudeamus igitur]]. The song describes an [[Assyria|old Assyrian]] [[drinking binge]] of a man in an inn with some references to the [[Classics]]. The desks are made of marble and the large invoice is being provided in [[cuneiform]] on bricks. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineveh. A Nubian house servant kicks him out then and the song closes with the notion, that (compare John 4:44) a prophet has no honor in his own country, if he doesn't pay cash for his consumption.  [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] has translated the poems among other works of Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], Gaudeamus! Humorous Poems by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35848?msg=welcome_stranger#bibrec Ebook-Nr. 35848 on gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Each stanza begins with the naming verse "Im Schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon", but varies the outcome. The "Im" is rather prolonged with the melody and increases the impact. Some of the stanzas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
Da trank ein Mann drei Tag',
&lt;br&gt;
Bis dass er steif wie ein Besenstiel
&lt;br&gt;
Am Marmortische lag.
&lt;br&gt;

'In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
A man drank day by day,
&lt;br&gt;
Till, stiff as any broom-handle,
&lt;br&gt;
Upon the floor he lay.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
The waiters brought the bill,
&lt;br&gt;
In arrow-heads on six broad tiles
&lt;br&gt;
To him who thus did swill.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
No prophet hath renown;
&lt;br&gt;
And he who there would drink in peace
&lt;br&gt;
Must pay the money down.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to German Poetry: A Dual-Language Book, Gustave Mathieu, Guy Stern Courier Dover Publications, 31.05.2012, including as well a translation 
&lt;/ref&gt; as e.g. [[Historical criticism]] and interpretations of the [[Book of Jonah]] as a mere shipwrecking narrative. According to Scheffel, the guest didn't try to get back in the inn as ‚ÄûAussi bini, aussi bleibi, wai Ascalun, ihr grobi Kaibi‚Äú (I been out, I stay so, you rude Aschkelon calves). There are various additional verses, including political parodist ones and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities.
The song has been used as name for traditional inns and restaurants, e.g. in Heidelberg and [[Bad S√§ckingen]]. In Bad S√§ckingen the name was used on several (consecutive) inns and was namegiver for the still existing club "Walfisch Gesellschaft S√§ckingen" (Walfischia), honoring Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotel-restaurant-schwarzer-walfisch.de/de/geschichte.html Hotel-Restaurant ‚ÄúZum Schwarzen Walfisch‚Äù Bad S√§ckingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics International ==
There is one version just and only one for mathematics, called 'International'.&lt;ref&gt;History of Mathematics: A Supplement C. Smory≈Ñski, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient times, upon the door &lt;br&gt;
Of Plato, there was writt'n: &lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúTo each non-mathematicus &lt;br&gt;
The entrance is forbidd'n.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same stanza is available in further 13 languages, including Greek (ŒúŒµŒªŒ±ŒØŒΩ·øÉ œÑ·øá ·ºêŒΩ Œ¶Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒØŒΩ·æ≥ - Mela√≠nƒì (black) tƒì (the) en (in) Phala√≠na (whale)) and Volap√ºk, which are sung one after the other.

The Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment, Paryavaran Complex, South of Saket, New Delhi owes its origin to the deliberations at Founes (1971), [[Stockholm]] (1972) and [[Belgrade]] (1975) and subsequent resolutions and recommendations of the Intergovernmental Conference on Environment at [[Tbilisi]] in 1977 organised by [[UNEP]] and [[UNESCO]]. The Institute 
was established as a public charitable trust on 5 June 1980 for organising programs and providing learning platform in the areas of ecology, environment, pollution control, disaster management, sustainable development, ecological tourism and environmental education. The Institute also collaborates with the Government of Delhi in conducting ecological education in more than 1000 schools in New Delhi. The Institute arranges for technology transfer on [[environmental engineering]], [[impact assessment]], [[Pollution control|pollution monitoring and control]], [[systems analysis]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[environmental communication]], ecological education and [[environmental laws]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

'''Intergroup dialogue''' is a "face to face facilitated conversation between members of two or more social identity groups that strives to create new levels of understanding, relating and action." This process promotes conversation around controversial issues, specifically, in order to generate new "collective visions" that uphold the dignity of all people.&lt;ref name="Bridging Differences"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Z√∫√±iga|first1=Ximena|title=Bridging Differences through Dialogue |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/JamesOlive/ClassMaterials/EDC551/Zuniga%20%282002%29.pdf |publisher=About Campus |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue is based in the philosophies of the democratic and popular education movements. It is most commonly used on college campuses, but may assume different namesakes in other settings.

== History ==

Intergroup dialogue is rooted in "philosophical and cultural traditions that have valued dialogue as a method of communication and inquiry" to explore shared concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoem &amp; Hurtado (Eds.)|title=Intergroup dialogue: Deliberative democracy in school, college, community and workplace|location=Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press|pages=306‚Äì327}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions heavily influenced 20th century movements for [[democratic education]], which included intergroup dialogue as a core objective. The application of dialogue in education was a core tenet of the democratic education movement, drawing on the work of public intellectuals like [[John Dewey]] who envisioned "schools as social centers" that "educate youth for democratic citizenship." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Harkavy|title=The Enduring Appeal of Community Schools|journal=American Educator|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and other advocates of democratic education at the time envisioned dialogue as "the practice of deliberative democracy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trifonas|first1=Peter|title=Revolutionary Pedagogies: Cultural Politics, Instituting Education and the Discourse of Theory|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civic engagement]], [[experiential learning]] and [[student-centered learning]] are also products of this movement. For example, [[Paulo Freire]], a core figure in [[popular education]], adopted a theoretical approach to intergroup dialogue that emphasized the importance of people's own experiences, and need to build dialogue capacity to enable people to "analyze their situation and take action to transform themselves and their conditions.‚Äù [[Myles Horton]], another popular education thinker, co-founded the [[Highlander Research and Education Center]] (1932) - one of the earliest U.S. mainstream examples of a community center that offered dialogue, "popular education and literacy...as a means of promoting civic participation and social action organizing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minkler|first1=Meredith (Ed.)|title=Community Organizing and Community Building for Health and Welfare|date=2012|publisher=Rutgers Press|location=New Jersey|page=65|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intergroup education movement in the 1940s and 1950s built upon the idea of "dialogue as liberatory educational practice," also drawing from feminist, antiracist and [[critical theory]] as well as the Intergroup [[Contact hypothesis]]. This movement was a response in some capacities to 20th century U.S. political turmoil. The [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the rapid internal movement of [[African Americans]] from the rural South to the industrial north, contributed to considerable social unrest within the United States. Similar effects were felt in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] with the mass migration of [[Mexican Americans]] following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Z√∫√±iga, Nagda et. al."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Z√∫√±iga, Nagda et. al.|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education: Meaningful Learning About Social Justice|date=October 13, 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intergroup education was the foundation for "antibias, antiracist, multicultural, [and] [[social justice]] education" that sought to address this unrest, primarily in college campus settings.&lt;ref name="Z√∫√±iga, Nagda et. al." /&gt; In the 1980s, the [[University of Michigan]] inaugurated its [http://igr.umich.edu/ Program on Intergroup Relations], which inspired similar models at a number of universities throughout the U.S. The growing popularity of intergroup dialogue programs on college campuses coincided with other shifts in higher education, including, for instance, the integration of [[Critical race theory]] as academic discipline in law and other fields.

== Methodology and Approach ==

=== Intergroup Dialogue Goals ===

Intergroup dialogue is intended to build relationships amongst participants with different social identities through the use of personal storytelling, empathetic listening and interpersonal inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Joohan|last2=Kim|first2=Eun Joo|title=Theorizing Dialogic Deliberation: Everyday Political Talk as Communicative Action and Dialogue|journal=Communication Theory|date=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=51‚Äì70|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates three core educational goals: "consciousness raising, building relationships across differences and conflicts, and strengthening individual and collective capacities to promote social justice." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuniga|first1=Ximena|last2=Nagda|first2=Biren|last3=Chesler|first3=Mark|last4=Cytron-Walker|first4=Adena|title=Intergroup Dialogue in Higher Education|date=2007|publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780787995799|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intergroup dialogue distinguishes its approach from other dialogic methods such as debate and discussion.

==== Dialogic Goals ====

'''Debate:''' To clarify pros and cons of issues, to develop critical thinking skills

'''Discussion:''' To generate different perspectives on issues, to consider decisions among different options

'''Intergroup Dialogue:'''To increase critical self and societal awareness, to increase intergroup communication, understand and collaborative actions&lt;ref name="Z√∫√±iga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

=== Multi-partiality ===

Intergroup dialogue draws the work of  [[Freire]] whose work focuses on consciousness raising, a process through which members of an oppressed group come to understand the history and circumstances of their oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freire|first1=Paolo|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|date=1970|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=0826412769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup dialogue further aims to raise the consciousness of all participants, including those from advantaged and disadvantaged groups, through the use of  multi-partial facilitation. This approach was developed by Janet Rifkin, Professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as a method of conflict resolution, and was adopted by the Program on Intergroup Relations as a method of facilitating dialogue across difference of social identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roger|first1=Fisher|title=Multipartiality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MX3FfacNco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-partial approach to facilitation differs from both a neutral or impartial approach, as well as a model in which the facilitator acts as an advocate, such as in many feminist models. Multi-partial facilitation acknowledges the presence of ‚Äúdominant narratives‚Äù, within dialogue, or sets of assumptions and beliefs based on socialization and cultural values. If the facilitator were to be impartial and neutral in moments of conflict between dialogue participants, the dominant narrative would affirm the experiences and voices of the dominant group members and further marginalize the experience of marginalized participants. A multi-partial facilitation approach differs from facilitator-advocate approaches in that it is equally invested in the participation and growth of all dialogue participants; it encourages self-reflection and awareness through engagement rather than direct confrontation, an approach based on the belief that ‚Äúpeople who are not feeling threatened are more open to discussing their feelings and interests and are more open to discussing the effects the conflict is having on both groups.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=W|title=Psychological and Communication Processes Associated With Intergroup Conflict Resolution|journal=Small Group Research|date=2008|volume=39|issue=28|doi= 10.1177/1046496407313413|pages=28‚Äì41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than directly confronting a group member‚Äôs bias,  a multi-partial facilitator ‚Äúpursues‚Äù the dominant narrative and encourages group members to share their experiences, while simultaneously encouraging a critical analysis of the underlying assumptions and narratives at play.

== Presence on College Campuses ==

Universities worldwide offer intergroup dialogue programs to their students. Intergroup dialogue programs are frequently launched as part of larger campus diversity and social justice initiatives seeking to address tensions and conflict related to social identity, most centrally, race.  Campuses vary in their approach to intergroup dialogue, "tailor[ing] to the specific needs of the campus, school, academic department or student affairs unit that it serves." &lt;ref name="Bridging Differences" /&gt; Dialogue groups are generally housed in on-campus organizations or academic departments, included as course offerings in [[Social Work]], [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[American Studies]], [[Peace and Conflict Studies]] and [[Education]]. Students enrolled in intergroup dialogue coursework are typically required to complete supplementary readings, reflections, papers and in some cases, field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Z√∫√±iga|first1=Ximena|title=Fostering Intergroup Dialogue on Campus: Essential Ingredients|url=http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/w98/fostering.html|website=Diversity Digest|publisher=Association of American Colleges and Universities|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation and Outcomes ==

Research shows that Intergroup dialogue has positive impacts on participants' understanding of diversity and social justice issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alimo|first1=Craig|last2=Kelly|first2=Robert|last3=Clarke|first3=Christine|title=Diversity initiatives in higher education: Intergroup Dialogue Program student outcomes and implications for campus radical climate: A case study|journal=Multicultural Education|date=2002|volume=10|issue=1|pages=49‚Äì53|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216312081}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting a qualitative interview study with dialogue participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeakley|first1=Anna|title=The nature of prejudice change: Positive and negative change processes arising from intergroup contact experiences.|journal=Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Yeakley found that "connecting through a depth of personal sharing" has been shown to play a significant role in creating positive dialogue outcomes, while participants who "disconnected in response to hurtful intergroup conflicts" reported negative outcomes. Yeakley highlights the importance of facilitator training, and finds that five facilitation skills are essential to promoting positive outcomes:  ( 1 ) creating a safe space, ( 2 ) recognizing signs of negative processes, ( 3 ) encouraging and supporting depth of personal sharing, ( 4 ) engaging conflicts as teachable moments, and ( 5 ) attending to identity differences in awareness and experience.&lt;ref name="Z√∫√±iga, Nagda et. al." /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modern architecture''', or '''modernist architecture''' was based upon new and innovative technologies of construction, particularly the use of [[glass]], [[steel]] and [[reinforced concrete]];  the idea that form should follow function; an embrace of [[minimalism]]; and a rejection of ornament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/modernism|title=What is Modern architecture?|language=English|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after [[World War II]] until the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced as the  
principal style for institutional and corporate buildings  by [[Postmodern architecture]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=6-10}}

==Origins==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology, engineering and building materials,  and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and to invent something that was purely functional and new.

The revolution in materials came first, with the use of [[cast iron]], [[plate glass]], and [[reinforced concrete]], to build structures that were stronger, lighter and taller.  The [[cast plate glass]] process was invented in 1848, allowing the manufacture of very large windows. [[The Crystal Palace]] by [[Joseph Paxton]] at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864 by the first glass and metal [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]. These developments together led to the first steel-framed skyscraper, the ten-story [[Home Insurance Building]] in [[Chicago]], built in 1884 by [[William Le Baron Jenney]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=42-43}}  The iron frame construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]], then the tallest structure in the world, captured the imagination of millions of visitors to the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Paris Universal Exposition]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=14-16}}

French industrialist [[Fran√ßois Coignet]] was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete, that is, concrete strengthened with iron bars,  as a technique for constructing buildings.&lt;ref name="britannia"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124672/Francois-Coignet Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Fran√ßois Coignet]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-story house in the suburbs of Paris.&lt;ref name="britannia"/&gt; A further important step forward was the invention of the safety [[elevator]] by [[Elisha Otis]], first demonstrated at the Crystal Palace exposition in 1852, which made tall office and apartment buildings practical.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=42}}    Another important technology for the new architecture was electric light, which greatly reduced the inherent danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=16}}

The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century,  most notably [[Eclecticism in art|eclecticism]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian architecture]], and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]].&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000.

In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur L'Architecture'',  he urged: "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material;  for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet Le-duc, ''Entretiens sur Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaud√≠]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of the 19th century, a few architects began to challenge the traditional [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] styles that dominated architecture in Europe and the United States.  The [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1896-99) designed by [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]], had a facade dominated by large vertical bays of windows.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=27}} The [[Art Nouveau]] style was launched in the 1890s by [[Victor Horta]] in Belgium and [[Hector Guimard]] in France; it introduced new styles of decoration, based on vegetal and floral forms.  In Barcelona, [[Antonio Gaudi]] conceived architecture as a form of sculpture; the facade of the [[Casa Battlo]] in [[Barcelona]] (1904‚Äì1907) had no straight lines; it was encrusted with colorful mosaics of stone and ceramic tiles {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=33}}

Architects also began to experiment with new materials and techniques, which gave them greater freedom to create new forms. In 1903‚Äì1904 in Paris [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] began to use [[reinforced concrete]], previously only used for industrial structures, to build apartment buildings.{{Sfn|Poisson|pages=318-319}}  Reinforced concrete, which could be molded into any shape, and which could create enormous spaces without the need of supporting pillars, replaced stone and brick as the primary material for modernist architects. The first concrete apartment buildings by Perret and Sauvage were covered with ceramic tiles, but in 1905 Perret built the first concrete parking garage on 51 rue de Ponthieu in Paris; here the concrete was left bare, and the space between the concrete was filled with glass windows. [[Henri Sauvage]] added another construction innovation in an apartment building on Rue Vavin in Paris (1912‚Äì1914); the reinforced concrete building was in steps, with each floor set back from the floor below, creating a series of terraces.  Between 1910 and 1913, Auguste Perret built the [[Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es]], a masterpiece of reinforced concrete construction, with Art Deco sculptural bas-reliefs on the facade by [[Antoine Bourdelle]]. Because of the concrete construction, no columns blocked the spectator's view of the stage.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|page=318}}

[[Otto Wagner]], in Vienna, was another pioneer of the new style. In his book ''Moderne Architektur'' (1895) he had called for a more rationalist style of architecture, based on "modern life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0226869393 Otto Wagner, ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to this Field of Art''], 1895, translation by Harry Francis Mallgrave, Getty Publications, 1988, {{ISBN|0226869393}}&lt;/ref&gt; He designed a stylized ornamental metro station at [[Karlsplatz]] in Vienna (1888‚Äì89), then an ornamental [[Art Nouveau]] residence, Majolika House (1898), before moving to a much more geometric and simplified style, without ornament, in the [[Austrian Postal Savings Bank]] (1904‚Äì1906).  Wagner declared his intention to express the function of the building in its exterior.  The reinforced concrete exterior was covered with plaques of marble attached with bolts of polished aluminum. The interior was purely functional and spare,  a large open space of steel, glass and concrete where the only decoration was the structure itself.{{Sfn|Bony|page=36}}

The Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]] also began removing any ornament from his buildings.  His [[Steiner House]], in Vienna (1910), was an example of what he called [[rationalist architecture]]; it had a simple stucco rectangular facade with square windows and no ornament. . The fame of the new movement, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]] spread beyond Austria. [[Josef Hoffmann]], a student of Wagner, constructed a landmark of early modernist architecture, the [[Palais Stoclet]], in Brussels, in 1906‚Äì1911. This residence, built of brick covered with Norwegian marble, was composed of geometric blocks, wings and a tower.  A large pool in front of the house reflected its cubic forms. The interior was decorated with paintings by [[Gustav Klimt]] and other artists, and the architect even designed clothing for the family to match the architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=38}}

In Germany, a modernist industrial movement, [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) had been created in Munich in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]], a prominent architectural commentator. Its goal was to bring together designers and industrialists,  to turn out well-designed, high quality products, and in the process to invent a new type of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Lucius Burckhardt (1987) . ''The Werkbund''. ? : Hyperion Press. ISBN. Frederic J. Schwartz (1996). ''The Werkbund: Design Theory and Mass Culture Before the First World War''. New Haven, Conn. : Yale University Press. ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally included twelve architects and twelve business firms, but quickly expanded. The architects include [[Peter Behrens]], [[Theodor Fischer]] (who served as its first president), [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Richard Riemerschmid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. "Joseph August Lux: Werkbund Promoter, Historian of a Lost Modernity," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' 63/1 (June 2004): 202&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 Behrens designed one of the earliest and most influential industrial buildings in the modernist style, the AEG turbine factory, a functional monument of steel and concrete. In 1911‚Äì1913, [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] and [[Walter Gropius]], who had both worked for Behrens, built another revolutionary industrial plant, the Fagus factory in Alfeld an der Leine, a building without ornament where every construction element was on display. The Werkbund organized a major exposition of modernist design in Cologne just a few weeks before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.  For the 1914 Cologne exhibition, [[Bruno Taut]] built a revolutionary glass pavilion.{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=19}}

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was a highly original and independent American architect who refused to be categorized in any one architectural movement.  Like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], he had no formal architectural training. In 1887-93 he worked in the Chicago office of [[Louis Sullivan]], who pioneered the first tall steel-frame office buildings in Chicago, and who famously stated "form follows function." {{Sfn|Tietz|1999|page=16}}  Wright set out to break all the traditional rules. Wright was particularly famous for his [[Prairie Houses]],  including the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]](1893‚Äì94),;[[Arthur Heurtley House]] (1902) and [[Robie House]] (1909); sprawling, geometric residences without decoration, with strong horizontal lines which seemed to grow out of the earth, and which echoed the wide flat spaces of the American prairie.  His [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Building]] (1904‚Äì1906) in [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Unity Temple]] (1905) in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] and [[Unity Temple]] had highly original forms and no connection with historical precedents.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=62-63}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
At the end of the 19th century, the first [[skyscrapers]] began to appear in the United States.  They were a response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing American cities, and the availability of new technologies, including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the safety [[elevator]] invented by [[Elisha Otis]] in 1852. The first steel-framed "skyscraper", The [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, was ten stories high. It was designed by [[William Le Baron Jenney]] in 1883, and was briefly the tallest building in the world. [[Louis Sullivan]] built another monumental new structure, the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]], in the heart of Chicago in 1904-06. While these buildings were revolutionary in their steel frames and height, their decoration was borrowed from neo-renaissance, [[Neo-Gothic]] and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]].  The [[Woolworth Building]], designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1912, and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the [[Chrysler Building]] in 1929.  The structure was purely modern, but its exterior was decorated with [[Neo-Gothic]] ornament, complete with decorative buttresses, arches and spires, which caused it be nicknamed the "Cathedral of Commerce."   {{Sfn|Burchard and Brown|1966|page=83}}

==Rise of Modernism in Europe and Russia (1918‚Äì1931)==
After the first World War, a prolonged struggle began between architects who favored the more traditional styles of [[neo-classicism]] and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, and the modernists, led by [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]] in France, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] in Germany, and [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the new [[Soviet Union]], who wanted only pure forms and the elimination of any decoration. [[Art Deco]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Henri Sauvage]] often made a compromise between the two, combining modernist forms and stylized decoration.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The dominant figure in the rise of modernism in France was Charles-√âdouard Jeanneret, a Swiss-French architect who in 1920 took the name [[Le Corbusier]].  In 1920 he co-founded a journal called '''L'Espirit Nouveau'' and energetically promoted architecture that was functional, pure, and free of any decoration or historical associations.  He was also a passionate advocate of a new urbanism, based on planned cities.  In 1922 he presented a design of a city for three million people, whose inhabitants lived in identical sixty-story tall skyscrapers surrounded by open parkland. He designed modular houses, which would be mass-produced on the same plan and assembled into apartment blocks, neighborhoods and cities. In 1923 he published "Toward an Architecture", with his famous slogan, "a house is a machine for living in."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture", (1923), Flammarion edition (1995), pages XVIII-XIX&lt;/ref&gt;  He tirelessly promoted his ideas through slogans, articles, books, conferences, and participation in Expositions.

To illustrate his ideas, in the 1920s he built a series of houses and villas in and around Paris.  They were all built according to a common system,  based upon the use of reinforced concrete, and of reinforced concrete pylons in the interior which supported the structure, allowing glass curtain walls on the facade and open floor plans, independent of the structure.  They were always white, and had no ornament or decoration on the outside or inside. The best-known of these houses was the [[Villa Savoye]], built in 1928‚Äì1931 in the Paris suburb of [[Poissy]].  An elegant white box wrapped with a ribbon of glass windows around on the facade, with living space that opened upon an interior garden and countryside around, raised up by a row of white pylons in the center of a large lawn, it became an icon of modernist architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=83}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In Germany, two important modernist movements appeared after the first World War,   The [[Bauhaus]] was a school organized [[Weimar]] in 1919 under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]].  Gropius was the son of the official state architect of Berlin, who studied before the war with [[Peter Behrens]], and designed the modernist Fagus turbine factory.  The Bauhaus was a fusion of the prewar Academy of Arts and the school of technology.  In 1926 it was transferred from Weimar to Dessau;  Gropius designed the new school and student dormitories in the new, purely functional modernist style he was encouraging.  The school brought together modernists in all fields;  the faculty included the modernist painters [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Josef Albers|Joseph Albers]] and [[Paul Klee]], and the designer [[Marcel Breuer]].

Gropius became an important theorist of modernism, writing ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Idea and Construction‚Äô‚Äô in 1923.  He was an advocate of standardization in architecture, and the mass construction of rationally-designed apartment blocks for factory workers.  In 1928 he was commissioned by the [[Siemens]] company to build apartment for workers in the suburbs of Berlin,  and in 1929 he proposed the construction of clusters of slender eight to ten story high rise apartment towers for workers.

While Gropius was active at the Bauhaus, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] led the modernist architectural movement in Berlin.  Inspired by the [[De Stijl]] movement in the Netherlands, he built clusters of concrete summer houses and proposed a project for a glass office tower.  He became the vice president of the German ‚Äò‚ÄôWerkbund‚Äô‚Äô, and became the head of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1932.  proposing a wide variety of modernist plans for urban reconstruction.  His most famous modernist work was the German pavilion for the 1929 international exposition in Barcelona. It was a work of pure modernism, with glass and concrete walls and clean, horizontal lines.  Though it was only a temporary structure, and was torn down in 1930, it became, along with Le Corbusier's [[Villa Savoye]], one of best-known landmarks of modernist architecture.  A reconstructed version now stands on the original site in Barcelona.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

When the Nazis came to power in Germany, they viewed the Bauhaus as a training ground for communists, and closed the school in 1932.  Gropius left Germany and went to England, then to the United States, where he and [[Marcel Breuer]] both joined the faculty of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], and became the teachers of a generation of American postwar architects. In 1937 Mies van der Rohe also moved to the United States; he became one of the most famous designers of postwar American skyscrapers.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=93-95}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Expressionism]], which appeared in Germany between 1910 and 1925, was a counter-movement against the strictly functional architecture of the Bauhaus and Werkbund.  Its advocates, including [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]], [[Fritz Hoger]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]], wanted to create architecture that was poetic, expressive, and optimistic. Many expressionist architects had fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid‚Äì1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;   As result, many of the most innovative expressionist projects, including [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels'', remained on paper. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economic climate. A particular type, using bricks to create its forms (rather than concrete) is known as [[Brick Expressionism]].

[[Erich Mendelsohn]],  (who disliked the term Expressionism for his work) began his career designing churches, silos, and factories which were highly imaginative, but, for lack of resources, were never built In 1920, he finally was able to construct one of his works in the city of Potsdam;  an observatory and research center called the [[Einsteinium]], named in tribute to [[Albert Einstein]].  It was supposed to be built of reinforced concrete, but because of technical problems it was finally built of traditional materials covered with plaster. His sculptural form, very different from the austere rectangular forms of the Bauhaus, first won him commissions to build movie theaters and retail stores in Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Berlin. His [[Mossehaus]] in Berlin was an early model for the [[streamline moderne]] style.  His [[Columbushaus]] on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin (1931) was a prototype for the modernist office buildings that followed. (It was torn down in 1957, because it stood in the zone between East and West Berlin, where the [[Berlin Wall]] was constructed.)  Following the rise of the Nazis to power, he moved to England (1933), then to the United States (1941).{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=95}}

[[Fritz H√∂ger]] was another notable Expressionist architect of the period.  His [[Chilehaus]] was built as the headquarters of a shipping company, and was modeled after a giant steamship, a triangual building with a sharply pointed bow. It was constructed of dark brick, and used external piers to express its vertical structure. Its external decoration borrowed from Gothic cathedrals, as did its internal arcades. [[Hans Poelzig]] was another notable expressionist architect.  In 1919 he built the ''[[Gro√ües Schauspielhaus]]'', an immense theater in Berlin, seating five thousand spectators for theater impresario [[Max Reinhardt]].  It featured elongated shapes like stalagmites hanging down from its gigantic dome, and lights on massive columns in its foyer. He also constructed the [[IG Farben building]], a massive corporate headquarters, now the main building of [[Goethe University]] in Frankfurt. [[Bruno Taut]] specialized in building large scale apartment complexes for working-class Berliners.  He built twelve thousand individual units, sometimes in buildings with unusual shapes, such as a giant horseshoe.  Unlike most other modernists, he used bright exterior colors to give his buildings more life The use of dark brick in the German projects gave that particular style a name, [[Brick Expressionism]].{{Sfn|Tietz|1999|pages=26-27}}

The Austrian philosopher, architect and social critic [[Rudolf Steiner]] also departed as far as possible from traditional architectural forms. His [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], built from 1926 near [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] the [[Einsteinturm]] in Potsdam, Germany, and the [[Goetheanum|Second Goetheanum]], by [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1926), were based on no traditional models, and had entirely original shapes.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
After the [[Russian Revolution]]  of 1917, Russian avant-garde artists and architects began searching for a new Soviet style which could replace traditional neoclassicism.  The new architectural movements were closely tied with the literary and artistic movements of the period, the [[futurism]] of poet [[Vladimir Mayakovskiy]], the [[Suprematism]] of painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], and the colorful [[Rayonism]] of painter [[Mikhail Larionov]]. The most startling design that emerged was the tower proposed by painter and sculptor [[Vladimir Tatlin]] for the Moscow meeting of the Third [[Communist International]] in 1920:  he proposed two interlaced towers of metal four hundred meters high, with four geometric volumes suspended from cables.  The movement of Russian [[Constructivist architecture]] was launched in 1921 by a group of artists led by [[Aleksandr Rodchenko]].  Their manifesto proclaimed that their goal was to find the "communist expression of material structures." Soviet architects began to construct workers' clubs, communal apartment houses, and communal kitchens for feeding whole neighborhoods.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=86-87}}

One of the first prominent constructivist architects to emerge in Moscow was [[Konstantin Melnikov]], the number of working clubs - including [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1928) - and his own living house, [[Melnikov House]] (1929) near [[Arbat Street]] in [[Moscow]].  Melnikov traveled to Paris in 1925 where he built the Soviet Pavilion for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris in 1925;  it was a highly geometric vertical construction of glass and steel crossed by a diagonal stairway, and crowned with a hammer and sickle.  The leading group of constructivist architects, led by [[Vesnin brothers]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], was publishing the 'Contemporary Architecture' journal. This group created several major constructivist projects in the wake of the First Five Year Plan - including colossal [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1932) - and made an attempt to start the standardization of living blocks with Ginzburg's [[Narkomfin building]]. A number of architects from the pre-Soviet period also took up the constructivist style.  The most famous example was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in Moscow (1924), by [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alexey Shchusev (1873-1949)|url = http://www.architectural-review.com/view/reviews/reputations/alexey-shchusev-1873-1949/8660736.article|accessdate = 2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main centers of constructivist architecture were Moscow and Leningrad; however, during the industrialization lots of constructivist buildings were erected in provincial cities. The regional industrial centers, including [[Yekaterinburg|Ekaterinburg]], [[Kharkiv]] or [[Ivanovo]], were rebuilt in the constructivist manner; some cities, like [[Magnitogorsk]] or [[Zaporizhia]], were constructed anew (the so-called ''socgorod'', or 'socialist city').

The style fell markedly out of favor in the 1930s, replaced by the more grandiose nationalist styles that Stalin favored. Constructivist architects and even [[Le Corbusier]] projects for the new [[Palace of the Soviets]] from 1931 to 1933, but the winner was an early Stalinist building in the style termed [[Postconstructivism]].  The last major Russian constructivist building, by [[Boris Iofan]], was built for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Exhibition]] (1937), where it faced the pavilion of Nazi Germany by Hitler's architect [[Albert Speer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Facing Hitler's Pavilion: The Uses of Modernity in the Soviet Pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exhibition|url = http://jch.sagepub.com/content/47/1/13|journal = Journal of Contemporary History|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 0022-0094|pages = 13‚Äì47|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022009411422369|first = Danilo|last = Udoviƒçki-Selb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernism becomes a movement: CIAM (1928)===
{{main article|Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne}}
By the late 1920s, modernism had become an important movement in Europe.  Architecture, which previously had been predominantly national, began to become international.  The architects traveled, met each other, and shared ideas. Several modernists, including [[Le Corbusier]], had participated in the competition for the headquarters of the [[League of Nations]] in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the [[Weissenhof Estate]] [[Stuttgart]].  Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; [[Le Corbusier]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style.  The first meeting of the ''[[Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne|Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne]]'' or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a chateau on [[Lake Leman]] in Switzerland June 26‚Äì28, 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], [[Auguste Perret]], [[Pierre Chareau]] and [[Tony Garnier (architect)|Tony Garnier]] from France; [[Victor Bourgeois]] from Belgium; [[Walter Gropius]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Ernst May]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from Germany; [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]]  from Austria; [[Mart Stam]] and [[Gerrit Rietveld]] from the Netherlands, and [[Adolf Loos]] from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included [[Josep Llu√≠s Sert]] of Spain and [[Alvar Aalto]] of Finland.  No one attended from the United States.  A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic "Rational methods for groups of habitations".  A third meeting, on "The functional city",  was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship traveling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized.  The text, called The [[Athens Charter]], after considerable editing by Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1957 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=84-85}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Art Deco]] architectural style (called ''Style Moderne'' in [[France]]),  was modern, but it was not modernist;  it had many features of modernism,  including the use of reinforced concrete, glass, steel, chrome, and it rejected traditional historical models, such as the [[Beaux-Arts style]] and [[Neo-classicism]];  but, unlike the modernist styles of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, it made lavish use of decoration and color.  It reveled in the symbols of modernity; lightning flashes, sunrises, and zig-zags. Art Deco had begun in France before World War I and spread through Europe;  in the 1920s and 1930s it became a highly popular style in the United States, South America, India, China, Australia and Japan.  In Europe, Art Deco was particularly popular for department stores and movie theaters. The style reached its peak in Europe at the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925, which featured art deco pavilions and decoration from twenty countries.  Only two pavilions were purely modernist;  the Esprit Nouveau pavilion of Le Corbusier, which represented his idea for a mass-produced housing unit, and the pavilion of the USSR, by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in a flamboyantly [[futurist]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Anwas, Victor, ''Art Deco'' (1992), Harry N. Abrams Inc., {{ISBN|0810919265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later French landmarks in the Art Deco style included the [[Grand Rex]] movie theater in Paris, [[La Samaritaine]] department store by [[Henri Sauvage]] (1926‚Äì28) and the Social and Economic Council building in Paris (1937‚Äì38) by [[Auguste Perret]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] and [[Palais de Chaillot]], both built by collectives of architects for the 1937 Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Poisson, Michel, ''1000 Immeubles et Monuments de Paris'' (2009), Parigramme, pages 318-319 and 300-01&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an exuberant American variant of Art Deco appeared in the [[Chrysler Building]], [[Empire State Building]] and [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, and [[Guardian Building]] in Detroit.  The first skyscrapers in Chicago and New York had been designed in a neo-gothic or neoclassical style, but these buildings were very different; they combined modern materials and technology (stainless steel, concrete, aluminum, chrome-plated steel) with Art Deco geometry; stylized zig-zags, lightning flashes, fountains, sunrises, and, at the top of the Chrysler building, Art Deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator ornaments. The interiors of these new buildings, sometimes termed Cathedrals of Commerce", were lavishly decorated in bright contrasting colors, with geometric patterns variously influenced by Egyptian and Mayan pyramids, African textile patterns,  and European cathedrals, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] himself experimented with [[Mayan Revival architecture|Mayan Revival]], in the concrete cube-based [[Ennis House]] of 1924 in Los Angeles. The style appeared in the late 1920s and 1930s in all major American cities.  The style was used most often in office buildings, but it also appeared in the enormous movie palaces that were built in large cities when sound films were introduced.{{Sfn|Duncan}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The beginning of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 brought an end to lavishly-decorated Art Deco architecture and a temporary halt to the construction of new skyscrapers. It also brought in a new style, called "Streamline Moderne" or sometimes just Streamline.  This style, sometimes modeled after for the form of ocean liners, featured rounded corners,  strong horizontal lines, and often nautical features, such as superstructures and steel railings. It was associated with modernity and especially with transportation;  the style was often used for new airport terminals, train and bus stations, and for gas stations and diners built along the growing American highway system.  In the 1930s the style was used not only in buildings, but in railroad locomotives, and even refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.  It both borrowed from [[industrial design]] and influenced it.&lt;!--Raymond Loewy; locomotives, aircraft, and ships, automobiles--&gt;&lt;!--cosmetic functionality--&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|2014|page=204}}

In the United States, the Great Depression led to a new style for government buildings, sometimes called [[PWA Moderne]], for the [[Public Works Administration]], which launched gigantic construction programs in the U.S. to stimulate employment.  It was essentially classical architecture stripped of ornament, and was employed in state and federal buildings, from post offices to the largest office building in the world at that time, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] (1941‚Äì43), begun just before the United States entered the Second World War.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism|url=http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration|accessdate=March 2011|page=27|origyear=2003|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110331105542/http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/GEMbook.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Frank Lloyd Wright|Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Richard Neutra}}
During the 1920s and 1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright resolutely refused to associate himself with any architectural movements. He considered his architecture to be entirely unique and his own. Between 1916 and 1922, he broke away from his earlier prairie house style and worked instead on houses decorated with textured blocks of cement; this became known as his "Mayan style", after the pyramids of the ancient Mayan civilization. He experimented for a time with modular mass-produced housing. He identified his architecture as "Usonian", a combination of USA, "utopian" and "organic social order". His business was severely affected by the beginning of the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929; he had fewer wealthy clients who wanted to experiment.  Between 1928 and 1935, he built only two buildings: a hotel near [[Chandler, Arizona]], and the most famous of all his residences, [[Fallingwater]] (1934‚Äì37), a vacation house in Pennsylvania for Edgar J. Kaufman. Fallingwater is a remarkable structure of concrete slabs suspended over a waterfall, perfectly uniting architecture and nature.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=99}}

The Austrian architect [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]] designed what could be called the first house in the modern style in 1922, the Schindler house. 
Schindler also contributed to American modernism with his design for the Lovell beach house in [[Newport Beach]]. The Austrian architect [[Richard Neutra]] moved to the United States in 1923, worked for short time with Frank Lloyd Wright, also quickly became a force in American architecture through his modernist design for the same client, the [[Lovell House]] in [[Los Angeles]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]] in Paris effectively marked the end of the Art Deco, and of pre-war architectural styles.  Most of the pavilions were in a neoclassical Deco style, with colonnades and sculptural decoration.  The pavilions of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], in a German neoclassical style topped by eagle and swastika, faced the pavilion of the Soviet Union, topped by enormous statues of a worker and a peasant carrying a hammer and sickle.  As to the modernists, Le Corbusier was practically, but not quite invisible at the Exposition; he participated in the Pavilion des temps nouveaux, but focused mainly on his painting.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|page=216}} The one modernist who did attract attention was a collaborator of Le Corbusier, [[Josep Lluis Sert]], the Spanish-Catalan architect, whose pavilion of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was pure modernist glass and steel box. Inside it displayed the most modernist work of the Exposition, the painting ''[[Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The original building was destroyed after the Exposition, but it was recreated in 1992 in Barcelona.

The rise of nationalism in the 1930s was reflected in the [[Fascist architecture]] of Italy, and [[Nazi architecture]] of Germany, based on classical styles and designed to express power and grandeur. The Nazi architecture, much of it designed by [[Albert Speer]], was intended to awe the spectators by its huge scale.  Adolf Hitler intended to turn Berlin into the capital of Europe, more grand than Rome or Paris.  The Nazis closed the Bauhaus, and the most prominent modern architects soon departed for Britain or the United States.  In Italy, Benito Mussolini wished to present himself as the heir to the glory and empire of ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=Frampton1&gt;{{cite book|last=Frampton|first=Kenneth|title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History|year=1980 |publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-20257-5|pages=210‚Äì218|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's government was not as hostile to modernism as The Nazis;  the spirit of [[Rationalism (architecture)|Italian Rationalism]] of the 1920s continued, with the work of architect [[Giuseppe Terragni]] His ''Casa dl Fascio'' in Como, headquarters of the local Fascist party, was a perfectly modernist building,  with geometric proportions (33.2 meters long by 16.6 meters high);  a clean facade of marble, and a Renaissance-inspired interior courtyard.  Opposed to Terragni was Marcello Piacitini, a proponent of monumental fascist architecture, who rebuilt the University of Rome, and designed the Italian pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition, and planned a grand reconstruction of Rome on the fascist model.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=120-121}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[1939 New York World's Fair]] marked a turning point in architecture between the Art Deco and modern architecture.  The theme of the Fair was the ''World of Tomorrow'', and its symbols were the purely geometric trilon and perisphere sculpture. It had many monuments to Art Deco, such as the Ford Pavilion in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style, but also included the new International Style that would replace Art Deco as the dominant style after the War. The Pavilions of Finland,  by [[Alvar Aalto]], of Sweden by [[Sven Markelius]], and of Brazil by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Lucio Costa]], looked forward to a new style.  They became leaders in the postwar modernist movement.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[World War II]] (1939‚Äì1945) and its aftermath was a major factor in driving innovation in building technology, and in turn, architectural possibilities.&lt;ref name=GEMWWII /&gt;&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials|year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-032573-1 |pages= 41‚Äì42, 48‚Äì49 |editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wartime industrial demands resulted in shortages of steel and other building materials, leading to the adoption of new materials, such as aluminum, The war and postwar period brought greatly expanded use of [[prefabricated building]]; largely for the military and government. The semi-circular metal [[Nissen hut]] of World War I was revived as the [[Quonset hut]].  The years immediately after the war saw the development of radical experimental houses, including the enameled-steel [[Lustron house]] (1947‚Äì1950), and Buckminster Fuller's experimental aluminum [[Dymaxion House]].&lt;ref name=Materials /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-Century Building Materials |year=1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-032573-1|page=259|editor=Thomas C. Jester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented destruction caused by the war was another factor in the rise of modern architecture.  Large parts of major cities, from Berlin, Tokyo and Dresden to Rotterdam and east London; all the port cities of France, particularly [[Le Havre]], Brest,  Marseille, Cherbourg had been destroyed by bombing.  In the United States, little civilian construction had been done since the 1920s;  housing was needed for millions of American soldiers returning from the war.  The postwar housing shortages in Europe and the United States led to the design and construction of enormous government-financed housing projects, usually in run-down center of American cities, and in the suburbs of Paris and other European cities, where land was available,

One of the largest reconstruction projects was that of the city center of Le Havre, destroyed by the Germans and by Allied bombing in 1944;  133 hectares of buildings in the center were flattened, destroying 12,500 buildings and leaving 40,000 persons homeless. The architect [[Auguste Perret]], a pioneer in the use of reinforced concrete and prefabricated materials, designed and built an entirely new center to the city, with apartment blocks, cultural, commercial and government buildings. He restored historic monuments when possible, and built a new church, St. Joseph,  with a lighthouse-like tower in the center to inspire hope.  His rebuilt city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=140-41}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Shortly after the War, the French architect [[Le Corbusier]], who was nearly sixty years old and had not constructed a building in ten years, was commissioned by the French government to construct a new apartment block in [[Marseille]].  He called it [[Unit√© d'Habitation]] in Marseille, but it more popularly took the name of the [[Cit√© Radieuse]], after his book about futuristic urban planning.  Following his doctrines of design, the building had a concrete frame raised up above the street on pylons.  it contained 337 duplex apartment units, fit into the framework like pieces of a puzzle. Each unit had two levels and a small terrace.  Interior "streets"  had shops, a nursery school and other serves, and the flat terrace roof had a running track, ventilation ducts,  and a small theater.  Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional;  the only decoration was a choice of interior colors that Le Corbusier gave to residents. Unit√© d'Habitation became a prototype for similar buildings in other cities, both in France and Germany.  Combined with his equally radical organic design for the [[Notre Dame du Haut|Chapel of Notre-Dame du-Haut]] at [[Ronchamp]], this work propelled Corbusier in the first rank of postwar modern architects.{{Sfn|Journet|2015|pages=152-163}}

==Postwar modernism in the United States (1945‚Äì1985)==
{{main article|International Style (architecture)}}
The [[International Style (architecture)|international Style]] of architecture had appeared in Europe, particularly in the [[Bauhaus]] movement,  in the late 1920s.  In 1932 it was recognized and given a name at an Exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City organized by architect [[Philip Johnson]] and architectural critic [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]],  Between 1937 and 1941, following the rise Hitler and the Nazis in Germany, most of the leaders of the German [[Bauhaus]] movement found a new home in the United States, and played an important part in the development of American modern architecture.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] was eighty years old in 1947;  he had been present at the beginning of American modernism, and though he refused to accept that he belonged to any movement, continued to play a leading role almost to its end. One of his most original late projects was the campus of [[Florida Southern College]] in [[Lakeland, Florida]], begun in 1941 and completed in 1943.  He designed nine new buildings in a style that he described as "The [[Child of the Sun]]". He wrote that he wanted the campus to "grow out of the ground and into the light, a child of the sun."

He completed several notable projects in the 1940s, including the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]] and the [[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville]], Oklahoma (1956). The building is unusual that it is supported by its central core of four elevator shafts;  the rest of the building is cantilevered to this core, like the branches of a tree. Wright originally planned the structure for an apartment building in New York City.  That project was cancelled because of the [[Great Depression]], and he adapted the design for an oil pipeline and equipment company in Oklahoma.  He wrote that in New York City his building would have been lost in a forest of tall buildings, but that in Oklahoma it stood alone.  The design is asymmetrical;  each side is different.

In 1943 he was commissioned by the art collector [[Solomon R. Guggenheim]] to design a museum for his collection of modern art. His design was entirely original;  a bowl-shaped building with a spiral ramp inside that led museum visitors on an upward tour of the art of the 20th century.  Work began in 1946 but it was not completed until 1959, the year that he died.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=128}}

[[Walter Gropius]], the founder of the [[Bauhaus]], moved to England in 1934 and spent three years there before being invited to the United States by Walter Hudnut of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]];  Gropius became the head of the architecture faculty. [[Marcel Breuer]], who had worked with him at the Bauhaus, joined him and opened an office in Cambridge.  The fame of Gropius and Breuer attracted many students, who themselves became famous architects, including [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Philip Johnson]].  They did not receive an important commission until 1941, when they designed housing for workers in Kensington, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.,  In 1945 Gropius and Breuer associated with a group of younger architects under the name TAC ([[The Architects Collaborative]]).  Their notable works included the building of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], the U.S. Embassy in Athens (1956‚Äì57), and the headquarters of Pan American Airways in New York (1958‚Äì63).  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=120}}

[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] described his architecture with the famous saying, "Less is more". As the director of the school of architecture of what is now called the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] from 1939 to 1956, Mies (as he was commonly known) made Chicago the leading city for American modernism in the postwar years.  He constructed new buildings for the Institute in modernist style, two high-rise apartment buildings on Lakeshore Drive (1948‚Äì51), which became models for high-rises across the country.  Other major works included [[Farnsworth House]] in [[Plano, Illinois]] (1945‚Äì1951), a simple horizontal glass box that had an enormous influence on American residential architecture.  The Chicago Convention Center (1952‚Äì54) and [[Crown Hall]] at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1950‚Äì56), and The [[Seagram Building]] in New York City (1954‚Äì58) also set a new standard for purity and elegance.  Based on granite pillars, the smooth glass and steel walls were given a touch of color by the use of bronze-toned I-beams in the structure. He returned to Germany in 1962-68 to build the new Nationalgallerie in Berlin.  His students and followers included [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Eero Saarinen]], whose work was substantially influenced by his ideas.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=129}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Influential residential architects in the new style in the United States included [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Charles and Ray Eames]].  The most celebrated work of the Eames was [[Eames House]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California,  (1949) Charles Eames in collaboration with [[Eero Saarinen]]  It is composed of two structures, an architects residence and his studio,  joined in the form of an L. The house, influenced by Japanese architecture, is made of translucent and transparent panels organized in simple volumes, often using natural materials, supported on a steel framework.  The frame of the house was assembled in sixteen hours by five workmen.  He brightened up his buildings with panels of pure colors.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=135}}

[[Richard Neutra]] continued to build influential houses in Los Angeles, using the theme of the simple box. Many of these houses erased the line distinction between indoor and outdoor spaces with walls of plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235921/http://www.aiacc.org/cgi-bin/htmlos.cgi/00671.3.4558823583020346930|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutra's [[Constance Perkins House]] in [[Pasadena, California]] (1962) was re-examination of the modest single-family dwelling.  It was built of inexpensive material‚Äìwood, plaster, and glass‚Äìand completed at a cost of just under $18,000. Neutra scaled the house to the physical dimensions of its owner, a small woman. It features a reflecting pool which meanders under of the glass walls of the house. One of Neutra's most unusual buildings was [[Shepherd's Grove]] in [[Garden Grove, California]], which featured an adjoining parking lot where worshippers could follow the service without leaving their cars.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Many of the notable modern buildings in the postwar years were produced by two architectural mega-agencies, which brought together large teams of designers for very complex projects. The firm of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] was founded in Chicago in 1936 by [[Louis Skidmore]] and [[Nathaniel Owings]], and joined in 1939 by engineer [[John O. Merrill|John Merrill]],  It soon went under the name of SOM.  Its first big project was [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], the gigantic government installation that produced plutonium for the first nuclear weapons. In 1964 the firm had eighteen "partner-owners", 54 "associate participants,"and 750 architects, technicians, designers, decorators, and landscape architects.  Their style was largely inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], and their buildings soon had a large place in the New York skyline, including the [[Lever House]] (1951-52) and the [[Manufacturers Trust Company Building]] (1954).  Later buildings by the firm include [[Beinecke Library]] at [[Yale University]] (1963),  the [[Willis Tower]], formerly Sears Tower in Chicago (1973) and [[One World Trade Center]] in New York City  (2013), which replaced the building destroyed in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132-33}}

[[Wallace Harrison]] played a major part in the modern architectural history of New York;  as the architectural advisor of the [[Rockefeller Family]], he helped design [[Rockefeller Center]], the major Art Deco architectural project of the 1930s. He was supervising architect for the 1939 New York World's Fair, and, with his partner [[Max Abramowitz]], was the builder and chief architect of the [[United Nations Building]];  Harrison headed a committee of international architects, which included [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (who produced the original plan approved by the committee) and [[Le Corbusier]],    Other landmark New York buildings designed by Harrison and his firm included [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], the master plan for [[Lincoln Center]], and [[John F. Kennedy Airport]].{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Philip Johnson]] (1906-2005) was one of the youngest and last major figures in American modern architecture.  He trained at Harvard with Walter Gropius, then was director of the department of architecture and modern design at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1946 to 1954. In 1947, he published a book about Mies van der Rohe, and in 1953 designed his own residence, the [[Glass House]] in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] in a style modeled after Mies's [[Farnsworth House]]. Beginning in 1955 he began to go in his own direction, moving gradually toward expressionism with designs that increasingly departed from the orthodoxies of modern architecture.  His final and decisive break with modern architecture was the AT&amp;T Building (later known as the Sony Tower, and now the [[550 Madison Avenue]] in New York City, (1979) an essentially modernist skyscraper completely altered by the addition of curved cap at the top of a piece of [[chippendale furniture]].  This building is generally considered to mark the beginning of [[Postmodern architecture]] in the United States.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=132}}

===Eero Saarinen===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Eero Saarinen]] (1910‚Äì1961) was the son of [[Eliel Saarinen]], the most famous Finnish architect of the Art Nouveau period, who emigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught, and then at the [[Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re]] Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University.  His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings; he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas, like the wings of birds.  In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of a parabolic arch 192 meters high, made of stainless steel (1948). He then designed the [[General Motors Technical Center]] in Warren, Michigan (1949‚Äì55), a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe, followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown, Virginia (1957‚Äì61).  His next works were a major departure in style; he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the [[Ingalls Rink]] in [[New Haven]], Connecticut (1956‚Äì59, an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables,  which served as a preliminary model for next and most famous work,  the [[TWA Terminal]]  at JFK airport in New York (1956‚Äì1962). His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable, and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey.  The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults, which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight.  Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure.  One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised, and the other is attached to the center of the structure. The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass. All of the details inside the building,  including the benches, counters,  escalators and clocks, were designed in the same style.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=171-72}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Louis Kahn]] (1901‚Äì74) was another American architect who moved away from the Mies van der Rohe model of the glass box, and other dogmas of the prevailing international style. He borrowed from a wide variety of styles, and idioms, including neoclassicism. He was professor of architecture at Yale University from 1947‚Äì57, where his students included [[Eero Saarinen]].  From 1957 until his death he was professor of architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  His work and ideas influenced [[Philip Johnson]], [[Minoru Yamasaki]], and [[Edward Durell Stone]]  as they moved toward a more neoclassical style.  Unlike Mies, he did not try to make his buildings look light;  he constructed mainly with concrete and brick, and made his buildings look monumental and solid.  He drew from a wide variety of different sources;  the towers of [[Richards Medical Research Laboratories]] were inspired by the architecture of the Renaissance towns he had seen in Italy as a resident architect at the [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1950. Notable buildings by Kahn in the United States include the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]], New York (1962);  and the [[Kimball Art Museum]] in [[Fort Worth]], Texas (1966‚Äì72).  Following the example of [[Le Corbusier]] and his design of the government buildings in [[Chandigarh]], the capital city of the [[Haryana]] &amp; [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] State of India, Kahn designed the [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] (National Assembly Building) in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (1962‚Äì74), when that country won independence from Pakistan. It was Kahn's last work.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=149}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[I. M. Pei]] (born 1917) is a major figure in late modernism and the debut of [[Post-modern architecture]]. He was born in China and educated in the United States, studying architecture at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. While the architecture school there still trained in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, Pei discovered the writings of [[Le Corbusier]], and a two-day visit by Le Corbusier to the campus in 1935 had a major impact on Pei's ideas of architecture. In the late 1930s he moved to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied with [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] and became deeply involved in Modernism.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=36}}  After the War he worked on large projects for the New York real estate developer [[William Zeckendorf]], before breaking away and starting his own firm. One of the first buildings his own firm designed was the [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the clean modernist facade was admired, the building developed an unexpected problem; it created a wind-tunnel effect, and in strong winds the doors could not be opened. Pei was forced to construct a tunnel so visitors could enter the building during high winds.

Between 1963 and 1967 Pei designed the [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado]], in an open area at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. His design was a striking departure from traditional modernism;  it looked as if it were carved out of the side of the mountain.{{Sfn|Boehm|2000|page=59}}

In the late modernist area, art museums bypassed skyscrapers as the most prestigious architectural projects;  they offered greater possibilities for innovation in form and more visibility.  Pei established himself with his design for the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]] (1973), which was praised for its imaginative use of a small space, and its respect for the landscape and other buildings around it.  This led to the commission for one of the most important museum projects of the period, the new East Wing of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, completed in 1978,  and to another of Pei's most famous projects, the pyramid at the entrance of [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris (1983‚Äì89). Pei chose the pyramid as the form that best harmonized with the Renaissance and neoclassical forms of the historic Louvre., as well as for its associations with Napoleon and the [[Battle of the Pyramids]]. Each face of the pyramid is supported by 128 beams of stainless steel, supporting 675 panels of glass, each 2.9 by 1.9 meters.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=210}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In France, [[Le Corbusier]] remained the most prominent architect, though he built few buildings there.  His most prominent late work was the convent of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] in Evreaux-sur-l'Arbresle.  The Convent, built of raw concrete, was austere and without ornament,  inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on his first trip to Italy.  {{Sfn|Journel|2015|pages=164-165}}

In Britain, the major figures in modernism included [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (1926‚Äì1992) and [[Denys Lasdun]] (1914‚Äì2001).  Lasdun's best-known work is the [[Royal National Theatre]] (1967‚Äì1976) on the south bank of the Thames.  Its raw concrete and blockish form offended British traditionalists; [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] Prince Charles compared it with a nuclear power station.

In Belgium, a major figure was Charles Vandenhove (born 1927)  who constructed an important series of buildings for the University Hospital Center in [[Liege]].  His later work ventured into colorful rethinking of historical styles, such as Palladian architecture.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=162}}

In Finland, the most influential architect was [[Alvar Aalto]], who adapted his version of modernism to the Nordic landscape, light, and materials, particularly the use of wood. After World War II, he taught architecture in the United States. In Sweden, [[Arne Jacobsen]] was the best-known of the modernists, who designed furniture as well as carefully-proportioned buildings.

In Italy, the most prominent modernist was [[Gio Ponti]], who worked often with the structural engineer [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], a specialist in reinforced concrete.  Nervi created concrete beams of exceptional length, twenty-five meters, which allowed greater flexibility in forms and greater heights.  Their best-known design was the [[Pirelli Building]] in [[Milan]] (1958‚Äì1960), which for decades was the tallest building in Italy.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=164-165}}

The most famous Spanish modernist was the Catalan architect [[Josep Lluis Sert]], who worked with great success in Spain, France and the United States. In his early career he worked for a time under Le Corbusier, and designed the Spanish pavilion for the 1937 Paris Exposition. His notable later work included the [[Fondation Maeght]] in Saint-Paul-de-Provence, France (1964), and the [[Harvard Science Center]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as Dean of Architecture at the [[Harvard School of Design]].

Notable German modernists included [[Johannes Krahn]], who played an important part in rebuilding German cities after World War II, and built several important museums and churches, notably [[St. Martin, Idstein]], which artfully combined stone masonry, concrete and glass.  Leading Austrian architects of the style included [[Gustav Peichl]], whose later works included the [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|Art and Exhibition Center of the German Federal Republic]] in Bonn, Germany (1989).

[[Brazil]] became a showcase of modern architecture in the late 1930s through the work of [[Lucio Costa]] (1902‚Äì1998) and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] (1907‚Äì2012).  Costa had the lead and Niemeyer collaborated on the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro (1936‚Äì43) and the Brazilian pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.  Following the war, Niemeyer, along with Le Corbusier, conceived the form of the [[United Nations Headquarters]] constructed by Walter Harrison.

Lucio Costa also had overall responsibility for the plan of the most audacious modernist project in Brazil;  the creation of a new capital, [[Brasilia]], constructed between 1956 and 1961.  Costa made the general plan, laid out in the form of a cross, with the major government buildings in the center.  Niemeyer was responsible for designing the government buildings, including the palace of the President;the National Assembly, composed of two towers for the two branches of the legislature and two meeting halls, one with a cupola and other with an inverted cupola. Niemeyer also built the cathedral, eighteen ministries, and giant blocks of housing, each designed for three thousand residents, each with its own school, shops, and chapel. Modernism was employed both as an architectural principle and as a guideline for organizing society, as explored in ''[[The Modernist City]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19722338|title=The modernist city : an anthropological critique of Bras√≠lia|last=James.|first=Holston,|date=1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226349794|location=Chicago|oclc=19722338}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a military coup d'√©tat in Brazil in 1964, Niemeyer moved to France, where he designed the modernist headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris (1965‚Äì1980), a miniature of his United Nations plan.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|pages=165-167}}

Mexico also had a prominent modernist movement.  Important figures included F√©lix Candela, born in Spain, who emigrated to Mexico in 1939, and participated in the construction of the new University of Mexico City;  he specialized in concrete structures in unusual parabolic forms. Another important figure was [[Mario Pani]], who designed the [[Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] in Mexico City (1949), and the [[Torre Insignia]] (1988). [[Augusto H. Alvarez]] designed the [[Torre Latinamericano]], one of the early modernist skyscrapers in Mexico City (1956);  it successfully withstood the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], which destroyed many other buildings in the city center.  1964. [[Pedro Ramirez Vasquez]] and [[Rafael Mijares]]  designed the Olympic Stadium for the 1968 Olympics, and Antoni Peyri and Candela designed the Palace of Sports. [[Luis Barragan]] was another influential figure in Mexican modernism;  his raw concrete residence and studio in Mexico City looks like a blockhouse on the outside, while inside it features great simplicity in form, pure colors, abundant natural light, and, one of is signatures, a stairway without a railing.  He won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] in 1980,  and the house was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.{{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=166}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Japan, like Europe, had an enormous shortage of housing after the war, due to the bombing of many cities.  4.2 million housing units needed to be replaced.  Japanese architects combined both traditional and styles and techniques.  One of the foremost Japanese modernists was [[Kunio Maekawa]] (1905‚Äì1986), who had worked for Le Corbusier in Paris until 1930. His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism, combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with Le Corbusier.  His notable buildings include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo, all in the pure modernist style.

[[Kenzo Tange]] (1913‚Äì2005) worked in the studio of Kunio Maekawa from 1938 until 1945 before opening his own architectural firm. His first major commission was the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] .  He designed many notable office buildings and cultural centers. office buildings, as well as the [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]] for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.  The gymasim, built of concrete, features a roof suspended over the stadium on steel cables.

The Danish architect [[Jorn Utzon]] (1918-) worked briefly with [[Alvar Aalto]], studied the work of Le Corbusier, and traveled to the United States to meet [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].  In 1957 he designed one of the most recognizable modernist buildings in the world;  the [[Sydney Opera House]]..  He is known for the sculptural qualities of his buildings, and their relationship with the landscape. The five concrete shells of the structure resemble seashells by the beach.  Begun in 1957, the project encountered considerable technical difficulties making the shells and getting the acoustics right. Utzon resigned in 1966, and the opera house was not finished until 1973, ten years after its scheduled completion.  {{Sfn|Bony|2012|page=157}}

==Preservation==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Several works or collections of modern architecture have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]]. In addition to the early experiments associated with Art Nouveau, these include a number of the structures mentioned above in this article: the [[Rietveld Schr√∂der House]] in Utrecht, the [[Bauhaus]] structures in Weimar and Dessau, the [[Berlin Modernism Housing Estates]], the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]], the city of [[Asmara]], the city of [[Brasilia]], the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] of [[UNAM]] in Mexico City and the [[University City of Caracas]] in Venezuela, and the [[Sydney Opera House]].

Private organizations such as [[Docomomo International]], the [[World Monuments Fund]], and the Recent Past Preservation Network are working to safeguard and document imperiled Modern architecture. In 2006, the World Monuments Fund launched [[World Monuments Fund#Modernism at Risk|''Modernism at Risk'']], an advocacy and conservation program.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler‚Äôs eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 ‚Äì 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schl√ºter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‚Äòjust like on a painting,‚Äô and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schl√ºter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schl√ºter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69‚Äì90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world [‚Ä¶] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‚Äò‚Äônatural‚Äô‚Äô condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again ‚Äì not [[ontologically]] separated anymore [‚Ä¶].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‚Äòspace envelopes‚Äô (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial [‚Ä¶] and the tree in the wilderness as natural [‚Ä¶] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

On display in the Ancient Agora Museum in Athens, housed in the [[Stoa of Attalus]]]]
[[Image:Athen Stoa Ostrakismos 2.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Voting ostraca (for [[ostracism]], Ancient Greece)]]

An '''ostracon''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|·ΩÑœÉœÑœÅŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒΩ}} ''ostrakon'', plural {{lang|grc|·ΩÑœÉœÑœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±}} ''ostraka'') is a piece of [[pottery]], usually broken off from a [[vase]] or other [[earthenware]] vessel. In an [[archaeology|archaeological]] or [[epigraphy|epigraphical]] context, ''ostraca'' refer to [[sherd]]s or even small pieces of stone that have writing scratched into them. Usually these are considered to have been broken off before the writing was added; ancient people used the cheap, plentiful and durable broken pieces of pottery around them as convenient places to place writing for a wide variety of purposes, mostly very short inscriptions, but in some cases surprisingly long.

==Ostracism==
In [[Classical Athens]], when the decision at hand was to banish or exile a certain member of society, citizen peers would cast their vote by writing the name of the person on the sherd of pottery; the vote was counted and, if unfavorable, the person was [[exile]]d for a period of ten years from the city, thus giving rise to the term ''[[ostracism]]''.

==Egyptian limestone and potsherd ostraca==

The two arms, however, are rendered more crudely. It is likely that a master used this ostracon to teach his student, and the work of both individuals can be seen on the piece. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].|251x251px]]

Anything with a smooth surface could be used as a writing surface. Generally discarded material, ostraca were cheap, readily available and therefore frequently used  for writings of an ephemeral nature such as messages, prescriptions, receipts, students' exercises and notes: pottery [[sherd]]s, limestone flakes,&lt;ref name="Donadoni"&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Donadoni |editor-first=Sergio |title=The Egyptians |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1997 |isbn=0-226-15555-2 |page=78 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; thin fragments of other stone types, etc., but limestone sherds, being flaky and of a lighter color, were most common. Ostraca were typically small, covered with just a few words or a small picture drawn in ink;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Klauck |first=Hans-Josef |title=Ancient Letters And the New Testament: A Guide to Context and Exegesis |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-932792-40-6 |page=45 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the tomb of the craftsman Sennedjem at  Deir el Medina contained an enormous ostracon inscribed with the [[Story of Sinuhe]].&lt;ref name="Donadoni" /&gt;

The importance of ostraca for Egyptology is immense. The combination of their physical nature and the Egyptian climate have preserved texts, from the medical to the mundane, which in other cultures were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michel |last=Chauveau |title=Egypt in the Age of Cleopatra: History and Society Under the Ptolemies |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=2000 |isbn=0-8014-8576-2 |page=7 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These can often serve as better witnesses of everyday life than literary treatises preserved in libraries.

===Deir el-Medina Medical Ostraca===
{{See also|Medical Ostraca of Deir el-Medina}}
The many ostraca found at [[Deir el-Medina]] provide a deeply compelling view into the medical workings of the [[New Kingdom]]. These ostraca have shown that, like other Egyptian communities, the workmen and inhabitants of Deir el-Medina received care through a combination of [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medical treatment]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|prayer]], and  [[Egyptian magic|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=53 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the records at Deir el-Medina indicate some level of division, as records from the village note both a ‚Äú[[physician]]‚Äù who saw patients and prescribed treatments, and a ‚Äúscorpion charmer‚Äù who specialized in magical cures for scorpion stings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janssen |first=Jac. J. |title=Absence from Work by the Necropolis Workmen of Thebes |journal=Studien zur Alt√§gyptischen Kultur |volume=8 |year=1980 |issue= |pages=127‚Äì152 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ostraca from Deir el-Medina also differed in their circulation. Magical spells and remedies were widely distributed among the workmen; there are even several cases of spells being sent from one worker to another, with no ‚Äútrained‚Äù intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written medical texts appear to have been much rarer, however, with only a handful of ostraca containing [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]], indicating that the trained physician mixed the more complicated remedies himself. There are also several documents that show the writer sending for medical ingredients, but it is unknown whether these were sent according to a physician‚Äôs prescription, or to fulfill a [[home remedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDowell|2002|p=57 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saqqara Dream Ostraca===
From 1964‚Äì1971, Bryan Emery excavated at [[Saqqara]] in search of [[Imhotep]]'s tomb; instead, the extensive catacombs of animal mummies were uncovered.  Apparently it was a pilgrim site, with as many as 1¬Ω million [[ibis]] birds interred (as well as cats, dogs, rams, and lions). This 2nd-century BC site contained extensive pottery debris from the site offerings of the pilgrims.

Emery's excavations uncovered the "Dream Ostraca", created by a scribe named ''Hor of Sebennytos.'' A devotee of the god [[Thoth]], he lived adjacent to Thoth's sanctuary at the entrance to the North Catacomb and worked as a "proto-therapist", advising and comforting clients. He transferred his divinely-inspired dreams onto ostraca. The Dream Ostraca are 65 [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] texts written on pottery and limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical period ostraca==
{{See also|List of artifacts significant to the Bible}}

Famous ostraca for [[Biblical archaeology]] have been found at:
* [[Arad, Israel]], or [[Tel Arad]]
* [[Lachish]]
* [[Mesad Hashavyahu]]
* [[Ostraca House]] at [[Samaria]]
* [[Elah Fortress]] at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]]&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/10/30/israel.ancient.text/ |title=Archeologist finds 3,000-year old Hebrew text |work=CNN |date=October 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the lots drawn at [[Masada]] are believed to have been ostraca, and some potsherds resembling the lots have been found.

In October 2008, Israeli archaeologist, [[Yosef Garfinkel]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], has discovered what he says to be the earliest known Hebrew text. This text was written on an Ostracon shard; Garfinkel believes this shard dates to the time of King David from the Old Testament, about 3,000 years ago. Carbon dating of the Ostracon and analysis of the pottery have dated the inscription to be about 1,000 years older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The inscription has yet to be deciphered, however, some words, such as king, slave and judge have been translated. 
The shard was found about 20 miles southwest of Jerusalem at the Elah Fortress in Khirbet Qeiyafa, the earliest known fortified city of the biblical period of Israel.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

==Christian ostraca==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2014}}
Some Christian texts are preserved upon ostraca. In the late 19th century, 20 ostraca were found in [[Upper Egypt]], probably from the 7th century, written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].

The ostraca are of different sizes and shapes. The more extant is [[Luke 22]]:40-71, which runs over 10 pieces. The ostraca contain from 2 to 9 verses each, and cover {{bibleref|Matthew|27:31‚Äì32}}; Mark 5:40-41 (Mark 9:3); Mark 9:17-18, Mark 9:22; Mark 15:21; Luke 12:13-16; Luke 22:40-71; John 1:1-9; John 1:14-17; John 18:19-25; John 19:15-17. There is one ostracon with the inscription "St. Peter the evangelist," perhaps an allusion to the Gospel of Peter.

A Coptic Sa'idic ostracon preserves the [[Pericope Adulterae]] found in John 7:53-8:1, which is otherwise omitted in the Sa'idic New Testament. A Christian hymn to Mary, similar to the canticles of Luke, and some Christian letters have also been found.

Inscriptions on clay, wood, metal, and other hard materials, like [[Papyrus|papyri]], are valuable especially as literary sources for [[Early Christianity]]. They are found chiefly in Oriental countries (i.e. ''east'' of Rome or [[Southwest Asia]]), especially Egypt (which though east of Rome is technically [[North Africa]]). The greatest number are pieces of clay or scraps of pots inscribed with colors or ink. The oldest Christian ostraca, like the papyri, are Greek and date from the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]]; next come the Coptic and Arabian ostraca. Some of the texts not yet deciphered include several Nubian ostraca in a language spoken in the old Christian kingdoms in the vicinity of Aloa on the [[Blue Nile]]. 

In these inscriptions Greek letters are used, with some other signs. As to contents, ostraca are either profane or ecclesiastical. Potsherds were often used for correspondence in place of the less durable papyrus; occasionally the recipient wrote the answer on the back of the potsherd. Ostraca were also used for mercantile purposes, as bills, receipts, etc. C. M. Kaufmann and J. C. Ewald Falls, while excavating the town of Menas in the Libyan desert, discovered ostraca of this class‚Äîthe oldest Christian potsherds in the Greek language (5th century)‚Äîand H. J. Bell and F. G. Kenyon of the British Museum deciphered them. 

They refer to the vine-culture of the sanctuaries of Menas and represent, for the most part, short vouchers for money or provisions. The currency is based upon gold [[solidi]] issued by [[Constantine I|Constantine]]; the date is reckoned by the year of indiction. Of historical interest is the assistance given to invalid workmen, the employment of the lower clergy, the manner of provisioning the workmen, and especially the statements about the harvest periods in the Libyan district. The series of Coptic ostraca which deals with the clergy and the monasteries in the Nile valley is particularly extensive. They refer to all phases of administration and popular life. 

The ecclesiastical ostraca, in a narrow sense, contain Biblical citations from the [[New Testament]], prayers, extracts from the [[synaxaria]] (lives of the saints), and are partly of a liturgic character. Greek, which was then the language of the Church, is much used, with the Coptic. Among the samples published by W.E. Crum, a fine judge of Coptic dialects, there is a local confession of faith from the 6th century, besides the Preface and Sanctus of the Mass, prayers from the [[Liturgy of St. Basil]] and of St. Mark, a part of the [[didascalia]] of [[Schen√ªte of Athribis]], a Greek confession, and an [[excommunication]], also in Greek.
 
Particularly remarkable are those ostraca which contain liturgical songs. They represent our present song-books for which purpose rolls of papyrus were less suited than the more durable potsherds; in some cases wooden books were used. Among the pieces translated by Crum we find petitions for ordination in which the petitioner promises to learn by heart one of the Gospels, and a reference to an ancient abstinence movement, against which is directed a decree that the consecration-wine should be pure or at least three-fourths pure.

'''Pattern''' in architecture is the idea of capturing [[design|architectural design]] ideas as archetypal and reusable descriptions.  The term "pattern" in this context is usually attributed to [[Christopher Alexander]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA
| isbn = 0-19-501919-9
| last = Alexander
| first = Christopher
| title = A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction

}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Austrian born [[United States|American]] [[architect]]. The patterns serve as an aid to design [[city|cities]] and [[building]]s. The concept of having collections of "patterns", or typical samples as such, is much older. One can think of these collections as forming a [[pattern language]], whereas the elements of this language may be combined, governed by certain rules.

== Alexander's idea of patterns ==

Alexander's patterns seek to provide a source of proven [[idea]]s for individuals and communities to use in constructing their living and [[built environment|working environment]]. As such their aim is both [[aesthetic]] and [[political]]: to show how beautiful, comfortable and flexible built environments can be constructed, and to enable those people who will inhabit those environments to challenge any [[solution]] forced upon them.

A pattern records the design decisions taken by many builders in many places over many years in order to resolve a particular problem. Alexander describes a problem in terms of the so-called ''forces'' that act in it, and the ''solution'' is said to resolve those forces. If there are still unresolved forces, then additional patterns may be needed to balance these remaining forces.

== Pattern language ==

Patterns may be collected together into a [[pattern language]] that addresses a particular domain. A large body of patterns was published by Alexander and his collaborators as ''[[A Pattern Language]]''. The patterns in that book were intended to enable communities to construct and modify their own [[home]]s, [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]s, [[town]]s and [[city|cities]].

Other than Alexander's own projects, few building projects have tried to use Alexander's patterns. Those that have done so have met a mixed response from other architects, builders, architectural critics, and users. Alexander has come to believe that patterns themselves are not enough, and that one needs a [[morphogenesis|"morphogenetic"]] understanding of the formation of the built environment. He has published his ideas in the four-volume work ''[[The Nature of Order]]''.

While the pattern language idea has so far had limited impact on the building industry, it has had a profound influence on many workers in the [[information technology industry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4888">'''Polite architecture''', or "'''the Polite'''" in [[architectural theory]] comprises buildings designed to include non-local styles for aesthetically-pleasing decorative effect by professional architects. Thus the term groups most named current [[architectural style]]s and can be used to describe many non-[[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] architectural styles. Irreconcilable architectural practices include [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[Brutalist architecture|brutalism]]. 

==Description==
Polite architecture is characterised by stylistic and romantic features which have been intentionally incorporated by an [[architect]] for affectation. A building of polite design is conceived to make a stylistic statement which goes beyond its functional requirements. Its design is deferential to national or international architectural fashions, styles, and conventions; paying little or no regard to the conventional building practices and materials particular to a locality. 

'The polite' is also a concept of architectural theory used to differentiate from 'the vernacular'.

==Architectural theory==
The term is used by architectural historians to contrast with [[vernacular architecture]], which refers to buildings which are constructed from materials and building conventions particular to their locality. 

The [[Architectural history|architectural historian]] [[Ronald Brunskill]] has offered the following definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ultimate in polite architecture will have been designed by a professional architect or one who has acted as such through some other title, such as surveyor or master mason; it will have been designed to follow a national or even an international fashion, style, or set of conventions, towards an aesthetically satisfying result; and aesthetic considerations will have dominated the designer's thought rather than functional demands.&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000, page 27&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a theoretical term, the differences between "the polite" and "the vernacular" can be a matter of degree and subjective analysis. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, there are buildings which illustrate vernacular and polite content.&lt;ref&gt;Brunskill, 2000, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==The growth of polite architecture==
Although originally only accessible to wealthy individuals and institutions, since the [[developed world]]'s [[industrialisation]] buildings characterised by elements of 'the polite' have become prevalent throughout the building stock of developed countries. The rise in the number of buildings reflecting polite architectural features has been influenced by the expansion of the profession of [[architecture]], the availability of more artistically amenable and often more resilient man-made building materials for most structural and decorative purposes, such as [[cement render]], decorative bricks, plastics, glass and metals, and the availability of transport networks capable of delivering materials produced outside of a building's immediate locality. The growth of these elements in the late 18th and 19th centuries, led to an expansion in the proportion of buildings which are of polite design, which may be as a result of aesthetic architects being demanded by choice or by economic convenience. Its growth has continued in the 20th and 21st centuries however has been nuanced by local policy and aesthetic demands to incorporate facets of [[revivalism (architecture)|architectural revivalism]] in many styles of architecture.

French social philosopher [[Alfred Espinas]] gave the term its modern meaning, and its study was developed independently by two principal groups: the [[Austrian school]] created by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and the Polish school created by [[Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ryan |editor1-first=Leo V. |editor2-last=Nahser |editor2-first=F.

==Origin and etymology==
Coinage of the word ''praxeology'' is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his ''Th√©orie des sciences: Plan de Science int√©grale'' in 1882:

{{quote|On account of their dual natures of specialty and generality, these functions should be the subject of a separate science. Some of its parts have been studied for a long time, because this kind of research, in which man could be the main subject, has always presented the greatest interest. Physiology, hygiene, medicine, psychology, animal history, human history, political economy, morality, etc. represent fragments of a science that we would like to establish, but as fragments scattered and uncoordinated have remained until now only parts of particular sciences. They should be joined together and made whole in order to highlight the order of the whole and its unity. Now you have a science, so far unnamed, which we propose to call Praxeology (from œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ, action), or by referring to the influence of the environment, [[Mesology]] (from ŒºŒµœÉŒøœÇ, environment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdeau|first=Louis|title=Th√©orie des sciences: Plan de Science int√©grale|volume=Tome Second|publisher=Librarie Germer Bailli√®re|location=Paris|date=1882|quote=√Ä raison de leur double caract√®re de sp√©cialit√© et de g√©n√©ralit√©, les fonctions doivent constituer l'objet d'une science distincte. Quelques‚Äîunes de ses parties ont √©t√© √©tudi√©es de bonne heure, car ce genre de recherches, dont l'homme pouvait se faire le sujet principal, a pr√©sent√© de tout temps le plus vif int√©r√™t. La physiologie, l'hygi√®ne, la m√©decine, la psychologie, l'histoire des animaux, l'histoire humaine, l'√©conomie politique, la morale, etc., repr√©sentent des fragments de la science que nous voudrions √©tablir; mais fragments, √©pars et sans coordination, sont rest√©s a l'√©tat de sciences particuli√®res. Il faudrait les rapprocher et en faire un tout afin de mettre en lumi√®re l'ordre de l'ensemble et son unit√©. On aurait alors une‚Ä¶ science, innomm√©e jusqu'ici et que nous proposons d'appeler Prax√©ologie (de œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ, action), ou, en se r√©f√©rant a l'influence des milieu, M√©sologie (de ŒºŒµ∆°ŒøœÇ, milieu).|page=463|url=http://iris.univ-lille1.fr/handle/1908/3842|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by [[Clemens Timpler]] in his ''Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum'':

{{quote|There was Aretology: Following that Praxiology: which is the second part of the Ethics, in general, commenting on the actions of the moral virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timpler|first=Clemens|title=Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum|volume=libris IV pertractatam|location=Hanoviae|publisher=Apud Gulielmum Antonio|date=1608|page=388|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_IaPUCZDkdQYC#page/n418/mode/1up|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}|quote=Fuit Aretologia: Sequitur Praxiologia: qu√¶ est altera pars Ethic√¶, tractans generaliter de actionibus moralibus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was later mentioned by [[Robert Flint]] in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau's ''Th√©orie des sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Flint|title=Philosophy as Scientia Scientiarum|location=Edinburgh|date=1904|pages=254‚Äì55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern definition of the word was first given by [[Alfred Espinas|Alfred V. Espinas]] (1844‚Äì1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=Jean J.|title=Notes biographiques et bibliographiques sur Alfred Espinas|journal=Review Philosophique de la France et de l'Etranger|location=Paris|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|number=3|date=July‚ÄìSeptember 1967|pages=385‚Äì91}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of [[Efficiency|efficient]] action. The Austro-American school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.

With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] (in 1911), and proposed by [[Knight Dunlap]] to [[John B. Watson]] as a better name for his [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=John B.|title=Behaviourism: The Early Years|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} Watson rejected it. But the Chinese physiologist of behavior, [[Zing-Yang Kuo]] (b. 1898) adopted the term in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Murchison, Carl Allanmore, ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'', Volumes 3‚Äì4, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} It was also used by [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (in 1928 and later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=McDougall|title=The Battle of Behaviorism: An Exposition and an Exposure|date=1928|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Previously the word ''praxiology'', with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by [[Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski]] (in 1923). Several economists, such as the Ukrainian, [[Eugene Slutsky]] (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by [[Austrian economics|Austrian economist]] Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (1888‚Äì1938) during the [[Second International]] Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar [[Oskar R. Lange|Oscar Lange]] (1904‚Äì1965) in 1959, and later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Italian philosopher, Carmelo Ottaviano, was using the Italianised version, ''prassiologia'', in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the [[Second World War]] the use of the term ''praxeology'' spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to America his pupil [[Murray Rothbard]] defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas's approach in France was revealed in the works of [[Pierre Mass√©]] (1946), the eminent cybernetician, Georges Th√©odule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, [[Leo Apostel]] (1957), the cybernetician, [[Anatol Rapoport]] (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), [[Fran√ßois Perroux]], economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, [[Raymond Aron]] (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Under the influence of [[Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski]], praxeology flourished in Poland. A special "Centre of Praxeology" (''Zaklad Prakseologiczny'') was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first ''Materia≈Çy Prakseologiczne'' (''Praxeological Papers''), and then abbreviated to ''Prakseologia''. It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French [[statistician]] Micheline Petruszewycz, "A propos de la prax√©ologie".&lt;ref&gt;In 'Math√©matiques et Sciences Humaines', Paris, Centre de math√©matique sociale et de statistique-Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, No. 11. Ete, 1965, pp. 11‚Äì18, and a rejoinder 'R√©ponse a un appel' by J. Ostrowski, ''ibid'',, No. 19, Ete, 1967, pp. 21‚Äì26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including [[Immanuel Kant]]'s works, [[Max Weber]]'s work on [[methodological individualism]], and [[Carl Menger]]'s development of the [[subjective theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selgin|first=George A.|title=Praxeology and Understanding: An Analysis of the Controversy in Austrian Economics|url=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-and-understanding-analysis-controversy-austrian-economics-0|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|volume=2|date=1987|page=22|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austrian economics==
{{Austrian School sidebar |expanded=Theory}}
[[Austrian economics]] relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories.&lt;ref name="rothmeth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|chapter=Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics|title=The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics|date=1976|pages=19‚Äì39|chapterurl=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig von Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Austrian School economists continue to use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to its theorists, with the [[action axiom]] as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.

Advocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. "Praxeology, value judgments, and public policy." ''The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics'' (1976): 89‚Äì114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
In 1951, [[Murray Rothbard]] divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:
: A. The Theory of the Isolated Individual ([[Robinson Crusoe Economy|Crusoe Economics]])
: B. The Theory of Voluntary Interpersonal Exchange ([[Catallactics]], or the Economics of the Market)
:: 1. [[Barter]]
:: 2. With [[Money|Medium of Exchange]]
::: a. On the [[Free Market|Unhampered Market]]
::: b. Effects of [[government|Violent Intervention]] with the Market
::: c. Effects of Violent Abolition of the Market (Socialism)
: C. The Theory of [[War]] ‚Äì Hostile Action
: D. The Theory of Games (e.g., [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]])
: E. Unknown
At the time, topics C, D, and E remained open research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard. [https://www.mises.org/library/praxeology-reply-mr-schuller "Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller"], ''[[American Economic Review]]'', December 1951, pp. 943‚Äì46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
[[Thomas Mayer (American economist)|Thomas Mayer]] has argued that, because praxeology rejects [[positivism]] and [[empiricism]] in the development of [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]], it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the [[Scientific method#Characterizations|scientific method]]. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the [[Austrian school of economics]].&lt;ref name="Mayer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Mayer |title=Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response |publisher=Routledge|journal=Critical Review |date=Winter 1998 |pages=151‚Äì71 |ref=harv|doi=10.1080/08913819808443491|volume=12 |quote=}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton1999"&gt;"Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794‚Äì96 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians argue that that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ludwig von|last=Mises|title=Epistemological Problems of Economics|edition=3rd|date=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|translator-last=Reisman|translator-first=George|url=https://mises.org/library/epistemological-problems-economics|accessdate={{date|2017-02|04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothmeth" /&gt; Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and "unrepeatable," whereas scientific experiments are necessarily reducible.&lt;ref name="MisesHumanAction"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, the praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/09/12/antony-davies/complementary-approaches|title=Complementary Approaches|first=Antony|last=Davies|date={{date|2012-09-12}}|website=Cato Unbound|access-date={{date|2016-12-27}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of printing}}

A '''printing press''' is a device for applying pressure to an [[ink]]ed surface resting upon a [[printing|print]] medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. It marked a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and [[global spread of the printing press]] was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 1999, the [[A&amp;E Network]] ranked [http://www.wmich.edu/mus-gened/mus170/biography100 Gutenberg no. 1 on their "People of the Millennium" countdown]. In 1997, [[Time‚ÄìLife]] magazine picked [http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm Gutenberg's invention as the most important of the second millennium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310192514/http://www.mainz.de/gutenberg/g2000.htm |date=10 March 2010 }}; the same did four prominent US journalists in their 1998 resume [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm 1,000 Years, 1,000 People: Ranking The Men and Women Who Shaped The Millennium]. The [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07090a.htm Johann Gutenberg] entry of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] describes his invention as having made a practically unparalleled cultural impact in the [[Christian era]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]], a [[goldsmith]] by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. [[History of printing in East Asia|Printing in East Asia]] had been prevalent since the [[Tang dynasty]],&lt;ref name=Needham /&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; and in Europe, [[woodblock printing]] based on existing [[screw press]]es was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type based printing press system. His newly devised [[matrix (printing)|hand mould]] made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal [[movable type]] in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.

The printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."&gt;Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean (1976): "The Coming of the Book: The Impact of Printing 1450‚Äì1800", London: New Left Books, quoted in: Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas.

The phenomenon of publishing was born.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of [[mass communication]], which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in [[literacy]] broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging [[middle class]]. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-[[nationalism]], and accelerated by the development of European [[vernacular language]]s, to the detriment of [[Latin]]'s status as [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Benedict: "Comunidades Imaginadas.

=== Economic conditions and intellectual climate ===
{{See also|History of capitalism|Medieval university}} 
[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval university]] class (1350s)]]

The rapid economic and socio-cultural development of [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval society]] in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's improved version of the printing press: the entrepreneurial spirit of [[history of capitalism|emerging capitalism]] increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of [[Medieval university|medieval learning]] and literacy amongst the [[middle class]] led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1980}}; {{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technological factors ===
{{See also|History of Western typography|Medieval technology}}

Technologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43294-8|page=133|edition=1st|date=1994-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:

[[File:Holzspindelkelter von 1702.jpg|thumb|left|Early modern [[wine press]]. Such [[screw press]]es were applied in Europe to a wide range of uses and provided Gutenberg with the model for his printing press.]]

The [[screw press]] which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=21‚Äì35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in the 1st century AD by the [[Roman agriculture|Romans]], it was commonly employed in agricultural production for [[Pressing (wine)|pressing]] [[vitis vinifera|wine grapes]] and ([[olive]]) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onken|2009}}; {{harvnb|White|1984|pp=31f.}}; {{harvnb|Schneider|2007|pp=156‚Äì159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a [[cloth]] press for printing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|2007|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the [[paper]] presses which had spread through the [[Holy Roman Empire|German lands]] since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schulte|1939|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the [[platen]] on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1974|pp=39‚Äì46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:metal movable type.jpg|thumb|[[Movable type]] sorted in a [[letter case]] and loaded in a [[composing stick]] on top]]

The concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been [[History of science and technology in China|invented in China]] during the [[Song dynasty]], and was later used in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], where [[metal]] movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15‚Äì23, 61‚Äì73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, sporadic evidence that the [[typographical principle]], the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany ([[Pr√ºfening dedicatory inscription|Pr√ºfening inscription]]) to England ([[letter tiles]]) to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Germany: {{harvnb|Brekle|1995|pp=23‚Äì26}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|2005|p=25}}; England: {{harvnb|Lehmann-Haupt|1940|pp=93‚Äì97}}; {{harvnb|Brekle|1997|p=62}}; Italy: {{harvnb|Lipinsky|1986|pp=75‚Äì80}}; {{harvnb|Koch|1994|p=213}}. Lipinsky surmises that this typographical technique was known in [[Constantinople]] from the 10th to 12th century and that the [[Venice|Venetians]] received it from there (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.

Gutenberg greatly improved the process by treating [[typesetting]] and [[printing]] as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a [[lead]]-based [[alloy]] which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.&lt;ref name="EB: Printing"&gt;[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] 2006: "Printing", retrieved 27 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special [[hand mould]], the [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]].&lt;ref name="Childress 2008, 51‚Äì55"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51‚Äì55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]] proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to [[Logogram|logographic writing systems]], it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different [[letter (alphabet)|letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|pp=51‚Äì55}}; {{harvnb|Hellinga|2007|p=208}}: {{quote|Gutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the [[codex]], which had originated in the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=24‚Äì30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] [[scroll]] at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=1, 38‚Äì67, 75}}: {{quote|The most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both [[recto and verso]] could be used for writing ‚àí and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45‚Äì53}}. Technically speaking, a scroll could be written on its back side, too, but the very few ancient specimen found indicate that this was never considered a viable option. (p. 46)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A paper [[codex]] of the acclaimed [[42-line Bible]], Gutenberg's major work]]

A fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing [[paper]] manufacture. The introduction of water-powered [[paper mill]]s, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=68‚àí73}}; {{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim papermaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414‚Äì417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of [[parchment]] and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Febvre|Martin|1997|pp=41‚Äì44}}; {{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=419}}: {{quote|In the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=7f.}}: {{quote|Despite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the [[42-line Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;The ratio between paper and parchment copies is estimated at around 150 to 30 ({{harvnb|Hanebutt-Benz|2000|pp=158‚Äì189}}).&lt;/ref&gt; After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|2008|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Press skeen 1872 with description.png|thumb|left|Early Press, etching from Early Typography by William Skeen]] [[File:Printer in 1568-ce.png|thumb|upright|This [[woodcut]] from 1568 shows the left printer removing a page from the press while the one at right inks the text-blocks.

The small individual metal letters known as type would be set up by a compositor into the desired lines of text. Several lines of text would be arranged at once and were placed in a wooden frame known as a galley. Once the correct number of pages were composed, the galleys would be laid face up in a frame, also known as a forme.&lt;ref&gt; Lyons 2011, p. 59 &lt;/ref&gt;, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressinstitute.in/file-folder/rindsurvey/Rind%20June%202015%20SN.pdf] RIND Survey (The Press Institute of India- Research Institute for Newspaper Development) June 2015, p14&lt;/ref&gt; and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a [[frisket]] and [[tympan]] (two frames covered with paper or parchment).

These are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the [[platen]], using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power. 

The function of the press in the image on the left was described by William Skeen in 1872,
{{quotation | this sketch represents a press in its completed form, with tympans attached to the end of the carriage, and with the frisket above the tympans. The tympans, inner and outer, are thin iron frames, one fitting into the other, on each of which is stretched a skin of parchment or a breadth of fine cloth. A woollen blanket or two with a few sheets of paper are placed between these, the whole thus forming a thin elastic pad, on which the sheet to be printed is laid. The frisket is a slender frame-work, covered with coarse paper, on which an impression is first taken; the whole of the printed part is then cut out, leaving apertures exactly corresponding with the pages of type on the carriage of the press. The frisket when folded on to the tympans, and both turned down over the forme of types and run in under the platten, preserves the sheet from contact with any thing but the inked surface of the types, when the pull, which brings down the screw and forces the platten to produce the impression, is made by the pressman who works the lever,‚Äîto whom is facetiously given the title of ‚Äúthe practitioner at the bar.‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Early Typography|last = Skeen|first =William|publisher =Government Printer, Colombo |year =1872|isbn = |location =Ceylon|pages = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Gutenberg's press ==
{{See also|Letterpress printing}}

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn‚Äîa man who had previously instructed in gem-cutting‚Äîand Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt; However, it was not until a 1439 [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"/&gt;

Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an [[alloy]] of [[lead]], [[tin]], and [[antimony]], which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58‚Äì69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a special [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His [[type case]] is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, [[typographic ligature|ligatures]], punctuation marks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mahnke|2009|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based [[ink]] which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and [[vellum]] (high-quality parchment). In the [[Gutenberg Bible]], Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later work, the [[Mainz Psalter]] of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Sch√∂ffer]], had elaborate red and blue printed initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapr|1996|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Printing Revolution ==

The Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an "agent of change" through the societies that it reached. ([[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein|Eisenstein (1980)]])

=== Mass production and spread of printed books ===

[[File:Printing towns incunabula.svg|thumb|left|Spread of printing in the 15th century from [[Mainz]], Germany]]
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450‚Äì1800.png|thumb|The European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buringh|van Zanden|2009|p=417, table 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in [[Mainz]], Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title=Incunabula Short Title Catalogue |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, [[Bohemia]] and Poland.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; From that time on, it is assumed that "the printed book was in universal use in Europe".&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

In Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borsa|1976|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Borsa|1977|p=166‚àí169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt; In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.&lt;ref name="Febvre, Lucien; Martin, Henri-Jean 1976 by Anderson, Benedict 1993, 58f."/&gt;

European printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollak |first1=Michael|title=The performance of the wooden printing press|journal=The Library Quarterly|date=1972|volume=42|issue=2|pages=218‚Äì264|jstor=4306163}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, [[History of printing in East Asia|book printing in East Asia]] did not use presses and was solely done by [[block printing]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham 1965, p. 211: {{quote|The outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.}} {{harvnb|Widmann|1974|p=34, fn. 14}}: {{quote|In East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.}}  {{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}; {{harvnb|Man|2002|pp=112‚Äì115}}: {{quote|Chinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didn‚Äôt have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[Erasmus]]'s work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469‚Äì1536).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Issawi|1980|pp=492}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and [[papacy]] alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first [[newspaper]]s (see ''[[Relation (journal)|Relation]]'') which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|pp=387f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Incunable]] are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;The British Library [http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html Incunabula Short Title Catalogue] gives 29,777 separate ''editions'' (not copies) as of 8 January 2008, which however includes some print items from the 16th century (retrieved 11 March 2010). According to Bettina Wagner: "Das Second-Life der Wiegendrucke.

The printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of [[scientists]] who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the [[scientific revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Because of the printing press, [[author]]ship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, "One Author, one work (title), one piece of information" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of [[Aristotle]] made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Because the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Josh. ‚ÄúThe State of Publishing: Literacy Rates.‚Äù ''McSweeney‚Äôs Internet Tendency''. McSweeney, 5 July 2011. Web. 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing press was an important step towards the [[democratization of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,473529-2,00.html Malte Herwig, "Google's Total Library", ''Spiegel Online International'', Mar. 28, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/technology/1057780670.php Howard Rheingold, "Moblogs Seen as a Crystal Ball for a New Era in Online Journalism", ''Online Journalism Review'', Jul. 9, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). More people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Book production became more commercialised, and the first [[copyright]] laws were passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/2486-copyright-timeline#.Wl1E7ainHIU|title=Copyright Timeline: A History of Copyright in the United States {{!}} Association of Research Libraries¬Æ {{!}} ARL¬Æ|last=Eshgh|first=Amy|website=www.arl.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.&lt;ref name="CrickWalsham2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julia C. Crick|author2=Alexandra Walsham|title=The uses of script and print, 1300‚Äì1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8005wHw-KsC|accessdate=25 March 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81063-0|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilton2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Bilton|title=I Live in the Future &amp; Here's How It Works: Why Your World, Work, and Brain Are Being Creatively Disrupted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VXRLlTDNrUC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=14 September 2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-307-59111-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited{{Who|date=March 2015}} as one of the causes of the rise of [[nationalism]] in Europe.

A third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. The printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.&lt;ref name="Dittmar2011"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Jeremiah Dittmar|title=Information technology and economic change: The impact of the printing press|url=http://voxeu.org/article/information-technology-and-economic-change-impact-printing-press|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=VoxEU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like [[double-entry bookkeeping]] increased the reliability of trade and led to the decline of merchant guilds and the rise of individual traders.&lt;ref name="Raj2017"&gt;{{cite article|author1=Prateek Raj|title=How the Postal System and the Printing Press Transformed European Markets|url=http://evonomics.com/europe-markets-guilds-merchants-declined/|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=Evonomics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial printing presses ==
{{See also|History of printing}}
At the dawn of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130‚Äì133) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, the Stanhope press doubled the output of the old style press.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.

[[File:Koenig's steam press - 1814.png|thumb|left|[[Friedrich Koenig|Koenig]]'s 1814 steam-powered printing press]]

Two ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer [[Friedrich Koenig]] in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.&lt;ref name="Bolza 1967, 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Bolza|1967|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met [[Thomas Bensley]] and secured financial support for his project in 1807.&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press "much like a hand press connected to a steam engine."&lt;ref name="meggs130-133"/&gt; The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer [[Andreas Friedrich Bauer]].

Koenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to ''[[The Times]]'' in [[London]] in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making [[newspaper]]s available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of [[book]] production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other [[metadata (computing)|metadata]]. Their company [[Koenig &amp; Bauer AG]] is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.

===Rotary press===
The steam powered [[rotary printing press]], invented in 1843 in the [[United States]] by [[Richard M. Hoe]],&lt;ref name="meggs147"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Meggs|first=Philip B.|authorlink=Philip B. Meggs|title=A History of Graphic Design|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1998|location=|edition=Third|page=147|isbn=978-0-471-29198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.

By the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Also, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of [[jobbing presses]], small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as [[billhead]]s, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21234">'''Remodernism''' revives aspects of [[modernism]], particularly in its early form, and follows [[postmodernism]], to which it contrasts. Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=medina/&gt;

In 2000, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement instigated remodernism,&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; with a manifesto, ''Remodernism'' in an attempt to introduce a period of new spirituality into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in [[Albuquerque]] was accompanied by an essay from [[University of California, Berkeley]] art professor, Kevin Radley, who said there was a renewal of artists working without the limitation of irony and cynicism, and that there was a renewal of the sense of beauty.

In 2006, the [[Stedelijk Museum]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]], self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
&lt;ref name=amsterdam/&gt; In 2008, London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three [[Turner Prize]] nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.&lt;ref name=lewis-turner/&gt;

==History==
[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]], the founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;Packer, William. "Childish artists coming unstuck", p.13, and "Young pretenders of art have much to learn", p. 20, ''[[Financial Times]]'', March 13, 2001. The text from different editions is the same: "Childish and his co-founder, Charles Thomson, ushered in remodernism, 'a period of art . . . to reclaim the vision and spiritual values of the early Modernists and replace the ennui of Post-Modernism'."&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Remodernism'' manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled "towards a new spirituality in art." Its premise is that the potential of the [[Modernism|modernist]] vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges [[formalism (art)|formalism]].

It has a short introduction, summing up: "Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash." This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the "brainless destruction of convention." Point 7 states:
{{quote|Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.}}
Point 9 states: "Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists." Point 12 links its use of the word "God" to enthusiasm&amp;mdash;from the Greek root ''en theos'' (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, "It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry," and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because "there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now."&lt;ref&gt;Childish, Billy, and Thomson, Charles. [http://www.stuckism.com/remod.html "Remodernism"], stuckism.com, March 1, 2000.

Childish and Thomson sent their remodernism manifesto to [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]], Director of the [[Tate Gallery]], who replied, "You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto ''Remodernism''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221052217/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/stuck2.htm "Stuck on the Turner Prize: Send in the clowns"], [[University of Glasgow]].

I like the idea of filmmakers teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean.

[[Image:IncunabulumDetail.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail from a rare [[Blackletter]] [[Bible]] (1497) printed and rubricated in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Johann Gr√ºninger]].]]
'''Rubrication''' was one of several steps in the [[medieval]] process of [[manuscript]] making. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called ''rubricators'', were specialized [[scribe]]s who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red [[ink]] for emphasis. The term ''rubrication'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''rubrico'', "to color red".

== History ==
The practice usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term ''[[rubric]]'' was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as [[missal]]s, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated,{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 | pp = 24‚Äì25}} and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.

Rubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting [[grapheme |character]] of a [[canto]] or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than [[illumination (manuscript) |illumination]], in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of [[gold]] to give the appearance of [[light]] within the text.

Quite commonly the manuscript's initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of [[annotation]]s made in the [[Margin (typography) |margins]] of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to "rubricate here" or "add rubric". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the rubricator can be used along with [[codicology]] to establish a manuscript's history, or [[provenance]].

Later medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of [[movable type]] printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The "great majority of [[incunable]]s did not issue from the press in a finished state‚Ä¶ hardly any incunable was considered 'finished' by its printer‚Ä¶", suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works.  This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink "was not merely decorative‚Ä¶ red's original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way".{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}

==Uses==
The title "generally was written in one or more lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title", showing both the importance of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process.{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 |  pp = 24‚Äì25}}  As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the [[provenance]] of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.

==Ink==
The recipe for the red ink is given in [[Theophilus Presbyter |Theophilus]]' ''[[De diversis artibus]]'':
{{Quote |
To prepare white-flake, get some sheets of lead beaten out thin, place them dry in a hollow piece of wood and pour in some warm vinegar or urine to cover them. Then, after a month, take off the
cover and remove whatever white there is, and again replace it as at first.  When you have a sufficient amount and you wish to make
red lead from it, grind this flake-white on a stone without water, then put it in two or three new pots and place it over a burning fire.  You have a slender curved iron rod, fitted at one end in a wooden handle and broad at the top, and with this you can stir and mix this flake-white from time to time. You do this for a long time until the red lead becomes visible.{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}}}

The process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials.  The white material is [[White lead |lead carbonate]] and the red material is [[lead(II,IV) oxide]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29336">'''Science, technology, society and environment''' ('''STSE''') '''education''', originates from the [[Science and technology studies|science technology and society (STS)]] movement in [[science education]]. This is an outlook on science education that emphasizes the teaching of scientific and technological developments in their cultural, economic, social and political contexts. In this view of science education, students are encouraged to engage in issues pertaining to the impact of science on everyday life and make responsible decisions about how to address such issues (Solomon, 1993 and Aikenhead, 1994)

==Science technology and society (STS)==

[[File:ScienceOlympiad.jpg|200 px|right]]
The STS movement has a long history in science education reform, and embraces a wide range of theories about the intersection between science, technology and society (Solomon and Aikenhead, 1994; Pedretti 1997). Over the last twenty years, the work of Peter Fensham, the noted Australian science educator, is considered to have heavily contributed to reforms in science education. Fensham's efforts included giving greater prominence to STS in the school science curriculum (Aikenhead, 2003). The key aim behind these efforts was to ensure the development of a broad-based science curriculum, embedded in the socio-political and cultural contexts in which it was formulated. From Fensham's point of view, this meant that students would engage with different viewpoints on issues concerning the impact of science and technology on everyday life. They would also understand the relevance of scientific discoveries, rather than just concentrate on learning scientific facts and theories that seemed distant from their realities (Fensham, 1985 &amp; 1988).

[[File:pollution de l'air.jpg|200 px|left]]

However, although the wheels of change in science education had been set in motion during the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that STS perspectives began to gain a serious footing in science curricula, in largely Western contexts (Gaskell, 1982). This occurred at a time when issues such as, [[animal testing]], [[environmental pollution]] and the growing impact of technological innovation on social infrastructure, were beginning to raise ethical, moral, economic and political dilemmas (Fensham, 1988 and Osborne, 2000). There were also concerns among communities of researchers, educators and governments pertaining to the general public's lack of understanding about the interface between science and society (Bodmer, 1985; Durant ''et al.'' 1989 and Millar 1996).  In addition, alarmed by the poor state of [[scientific literacy]] among school students, science educators began to grapple with the quandary of how to prepare students to be informed and active citizens, as well as the scientists, medics and engineers of the future (e.g. Osborne, 2000 and Aikenhead, 2003). Hence, STS advocates called for reforms in science education that would equip students to understand scientific developments in their cultural, economic, political and social contexts. This was considered important in making science accessible and meaningful to all students‚Äîand, most significantly, engaging them in real world issues (Fensham, 1985; Solomon, 1993; Aikenhead, 1994 and Hodson 1998).

==Goals of STS==

The key goals of STS are:

[[File:waste dumping in a slum of Cap-Haitien.jpg|200 px|right]]

*An interdisciplinary [[Historical institutionalism|HI]] approach to science education, where there is a seamless integration of economic, ethical, social and political aspects of scientific and technological developments in the science curriculum.
*Engaging students in examining a variety of real world issues and grounding scientific knowledge in such realities. In today's world, such issues might include the impact on society of: [[global warming]], [[genetic engineering]], [[animal testing]], [[deforestation]] practices, [[nuclear testing]] and environmental legislations, such as the [[Waste legislation#EU waste legislation|EU Waste Legislation]] or the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
*Enabling students to formulate a critical understanding of the interface between science, society and technology.
*Developing students‚Äô capacities and confidence to make informed decisions, and to take responsible action to address issues arising from the impact of science on their daily lives.

==STSE education==

[[File:canal-pollution.jpg|150 px|right]]

There is no uniform definition for STSE education. As mentioned before, STSE is a form of STS education, but places greater emphasis on the environmental consequences of scientific and technological developments. In STSE curricula, scientific developments are explored from a variety of economic, environmental, ethical, moral, social and political (Kumar and Chubin, 2000 &amp; Pedretti, 2005) perspectives.

At best, STSE education can be loosely defined as a movement that attempts to bring about an understanding of the interface between science, society, technology and the environment. A key goal of STSE is to help students realize the significance of scientific developments in their daily lives and foster a voice of active citizenship (Pedretti &amp; Forbes, 2000).

===Improving scientific literacy ===
Over the last two decades, STSE education has taken a prominent position in the  science curricula of different parts of the world, such as Australia, Europe, the UK and USA  (Kumar &amp; Chubin, 2000). In Canada, the inclusion of STSE perspectives in science education has largely come about as a consequence of the ''Common Framework of science learning outcomes, Pan Canadian Protocol for collaboration on School Curriculum (1997)''[http://www.cmec.ca/science/framework]. This document highlights a need to develop scientific literacy in conjunction with understanding the interrelationships between science, technology, and environment.  According to Osborne (2000) &amp; Hodson (2003), scientific literacy can be perceived in four different ways:

*'''Cultural''': Developing the capacity to read about and understand issues pertaining to science and technology in the media.
*'''Utilitarian''': Having the knowledge, skills and attitudes that are essential for a career as scientist, engineer or technician.
*'''Democratic''': Broadening knowledge and understanding of science to include the interface between science, technology and society.
*'''Economic''': Formulating knowledge and skills that are essential to the economic growth and effective competition within the global market place.

However, many science teachers find it difficult and even damaging to their professional identities to teach STSE as part of science education due to the fact that traditional science focuses on established scientific facts rather than philosophical, political, and social issues, the extent of which many educators find to be devaluing to the scientific curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/ihpst07/proceedings/IHPST07%20papers/117%20Pedretti.pdf] - Promoting Issues-based STSE Perspectives in Science Teacher Education: Problems of Identity and Ideology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationale and goals===
In the context of STSE education, the goals of teaching and learning are largely directed towards engendering cultural and democratic notions of scientific literacy. Here, advocates of STSE education argue that in order to broaden students' understanding of science, and better prepare them for active and responsible citizenship in the future, the scope of science education needs to go beyond learning about scientific theories, facts and technical skills. Therefore, the fundamental aim of STSE education is to equip students to understand and situate scientific and technological developments in their cultural, environmental, economic, political and social contexts (Solomon &amp; Aikenhead, 1994; Bingle &amp; Gaskell, 1994; Pedretti 1997 &amp; 2005).  For example, rather than learning about the facts and theories of weather patterns, students can explore them in the context of issues such as global warming. They can also debate the environmental, social, enconomic and political consequences of relevant legislation, such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. This is thought to provide a richer, more meaningful and relevant canvas against which scientific theories and phenomena relating to weather patterns can be explored (Pedretti ''et al.'' 2005).

In essence, STSE education aims to develop the following skills and perspectives (Aikenhead, 1994; Pedretti, 1996; Alsop &amp; Hicks, 2001):

*Social responsibility
*Critical thinking and decision making skills
*The ability to formulate sound ethical and moral decisions about issues arising from the impact of science on our daily lives
*Knowledge, skills and confidence to express opinions and take responsible action to address real world issues

===Curriculum content===
Since STSE education has multiple facets, there are a variety of ways in which it can be approached in the classroom. This offers teachers a degree of flexibility, not only in the incorporation of STSE perspectives into their science teaching, but in integrating other curricular areas such as history, geography, social studies and language arts (Richardson &amp; Blades, 2001). The table below summarizes the different approaches to STSE education described in the literature (Ziman, 1994 &amp; Pedretti, 2005):

===Summary table: Curriculum content===

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Approach'''
! '''Description'''
! '''Example'''
|-
| '''Historical'''
|A way of humanizing science. This approach examines the history of science through concrete examples, and is viewed as way of demonstrating the fallibility of science and scientists.  
|Learning about inventions or scientific theories through the lives and worlds of famous scientist. Students can research their areas of interest and present them through various activities: e.g. drama-role play, debates or documentaries. Through this kind of exploration, students examine the values, beliefs and attitudes that influenced the work of scientists, their outlook on the world, and how their work has impacted our present circumstances and understanding of science today.
|-
| '''Philosophical'''
|Helps students formulate an understanding of the different outlooks on the nature of science, and how differing viewpoints on the nature and validity of scientific knowledge influence the work of scientists‚Äîdemonstrating how society directs and reacts to scientific innovation.
|Using historical narratives or stories of scientific discoveries to concretely examine philosophical questions and views about science. For example, ‚ÄúThe Double Helix‚Äù by [[James D. Watson]] is an account of the discovery of DNA. This historical narrative can be used to explore questions such as: ‚ÄúWhat is science? What kind of research was done to make this discovery? How did this scientific development influence our lives? Can science help us understand everything about our world?‚Äù  Such an exploration reveals the social and historical context of philosophical debates about the nature of science‚Äîmaking this kind of inquiry concrete, meaningful and applicable to students‚Äô realities. 
|-
|'''Issues-based'''
|This is the most widely applied approach to STSE education. It stimulates an understanding of the science behind issues, and the consequences to society and the environment. A multi-faceted approach to examining issues highlights the complexities of real-life debates. Students also become aware of the various motives for decisions that address environmental issues.
|Real life events within the community, at the national or international level, can be examined from political, economic, ethical and social perspectives through presentations, debates, role-play, documentaries and narratives. Real life events might include: the impact of environmental legislations, industrial accidents and the influence of particular scientific or technological innovations on society and the environment.

===Opportunities and challenges of STSE education===

Although advocates of STSE education keenly emphasize its merits in science education, they also recognize inherent difficulties in its implementation. The opportunities and challenges of STSE education have been articulated by Hughes (2000) and Pedretti &amp; Forbes, (2000), at five different levels, as described below:

'''Values &amp; beliefs:''' The goals of STSE education may challenge the values and beliefs of students and teachers‚Äîas well as conventional, culturally entrenched views on scientific and technological developments. Students gain opportunities to engage with, and deeply examine the impact of scientific development on their lives from a critical and informed perspective. This helps to develop students' analytical and problem solving capacities, as well as their ability to make informed choices in their everyday lives.

As they plan and implement STSE education lessons, teachers need to provide a balanced view of the issues being explored. This enables students to formulate their own thoughts, independently explore other opinions and have the confidence to voice their personal viewpoints. Teachers also need to cultivate safe, non-judgmental classroom environments, and must also be careful not to impose their own values and beliefs on students.

[[File:waldkindergarten.jpg|200px|right]]

'''Knowledge &amp; understanding:''' The interdisciplinary nature of STSE education requires teachers to research and gather information from a variety of sources. At the same time, teachers need to develop a sound understanding of issues from various disciplines‚Äîphilosophy, history, geography, social studies, politics, economics, environment and science. This is so that students‚Äô knowledge base can be appropriately scaffolded to enable them to effectively engage in discussions, debates and decision-making processes.

This ideal raises difficulties. Most science teachers are specialized in a particular field of science. Lack of time and resources may affect how deeply teachers and students can examine issues from multiple perspectives. Nevertheless, a multi-disciplinary approach to science education enables students to gain a more rounded perspective on the dilemmas, as well as the opportunities, that science presents in our daily lives.

'''Pedagogic approach:''' Depending on teacher experience and comfort levels, a variety of [[pedagogic]] approaches based on [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] can be used to stimulate STSE education in the classroom. As illustrated in the table below, the pedagogies used in STSE classrooms need to take students through different levels of understanding to develop their abilities and confidence to critically examine issues and take responsible action.

Teachers are often faced with the challenge of transforming classroom practices from task-oriented approaches to those which focus on developing students' understanding and transferring agency for learning to students (Hughes, 2000). The table below is a compilation of pedagogic approaches for STSE education described in the literature (e.g. Hodson, 1998; Pedretti &amp; Forbes 2000; Richardson &amp; Blades, 2001):

==Projects in the field of STSE==

===Science and the City===

STSE education draws on holistic ways of knowing, learning, and interacting with science. A recent movement in science education has bridged science and technology education with society and environment awareness through critical explorations of place. The project Science and the City, for example, took place during the school years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 involving  an intergenerational group of researchers: 36 elementary students (grades 6, 7 &amp; 8) working with their teachers, 6 university-based researchers, parents and community members. The goal was to come together, learn science and technology together, and use this knowledge to provide meaningful experiences that make a difference to the lives of friends, families, communities and environments that surround the school. The collective experience allowed students, teachers and learners to foster imagination, responsibility, collaboration, learning and action. The project has led to a series of publications:

*&lt;small&gt;Alsop, S., &amp; Ibrahim, S. 2008. Visual journeys in critical place based science education. In Y-J. Lee, &amp; A-K. Tan (Eds.), Science education at the nexus of theory and practice. Rotterdam: SensePublishers 291-303.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;Alsop, S., &amp; Ibrahim, S. 2007. Searching for Science Motive: Community, Imagery and Agency. Alberta Science Education Journal (Special Edition, Shapiro, B. (Ed.) Research and writing in science education of interest to those new in the profession). 38(2), 17-24.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Science and the City: A Field Zine'''

One collective publication, authored by the students, teachers and researchers together is that of a community zine that offered a format to share possibilities afforded by participatory practices that connect schools with local-knowledges, people and places.

*&lt;small&gt;Alsop, S., Ibrahim, S., &amp;  Blimkie, M. (Eds.) (2008) Science and the city: A Field Zine. Toronto: Ontario.
[An independent publication written by students and researchers and distributed free to research, student and parent communities].&lt;/small&gt;

===STEPWISE===

'STEPWISE' is the acronym for 'Science and Technology Education Promoting Wellbeing for Individuals, Societies and Environments.' It is a research and development project based on the STEPWISE framework, which integrates major categories of learning outcomes - including STSE - and relates all of them to 'WISE Activism.' In WISE Activism, students use their literacy in science and technology to try to bring about improvements to the 'wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments' (WISE). Students might, for example, use their knowledge about nutrition and issues relating to for-profit food manufacturing, along with data from their own inquiries into eating habits of students in a school cafeteria, to lobby the school administration to improve the nutritional value of foods on offer in the school.

The STEPWISE framework implements some important educational principles, including:
* Educate all students to the best of their ability;
* Address relationships among different learning domains (e.g., Skills and NoST Education);
* Encourage student self-determination (e.g., via student-led science inquiry &amp;/or technology design projects);
* Provide students with an apprenticeship that enables them to develop expertise for knowledge construction, dissemination and use in addressing important personal, social and environmental problems;
* Educate students about negative, as well as positive, aspects of the nature of science and technology and relationships between them and societies and environments; and,
* Encourage and enable students to take actions to address socioscientific issues; which implies that they use their literacy in science and technology (re: elements of STEPWISE) for improving the wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments.

An important research goal/finding is that:
* educators should help students to develop expertise for knowledge construction, dissemination and use in the context of WISE Problems [http://www.lbencze.ca/WISE_Problems.html] (i.e., problems regarding the wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments);
* doing the above may encourage and enable students to conduct science inquiry and/or technology design projects that explore possible WISE Problems;
* findings from students' WISE-oriented projects may serve as great motivation for addressing WISE Problems; more so than from STSE Education, since student-led science inquiry and/or technology design projects provide students with personal engagement in 'phenomena &lt;----&gt; representation' dialectical relationships.

You can learn more about STEPWISE, including how to get involved in it, at: [http://www.stepwiser.ca].

A forum for discussing STSE (socioscientific) issues and actions is at: [http://www.wepaste.org]. This forum contains a 'community-reviewed' journal; that is, the Journal for Activist Science &amp; Technology Education.

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone STSE education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement‚Äîbut not to replace‚ÄîSTSE coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, so students are not paid for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

The profession, previously widespread across cultures, lost most of its prominence and status with the advent of the [[Printing press|printing press.]] The work of scribes can involve copying manuscripts and other texts as well as secretarial and administrative duties such as the taking of dictation and keeping of business, judicial, and historical records for [[king]]s, [[nobility|nobles]], [[temple]]s, and [[City|cities]]. The profession has developed into [[Civil service|public servant]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[Audio typist|typist]]s, and [[lawyer]]s. In societies with low literacy rates, street-corner letter-writers (and readers) may still be found providing scribe service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/11/1055220661012.html|title=Women of letters doing write for the illiterate - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==
[[File:GD-EG-Louxor-126.JPG|thumb|300px|Egyptian scribe with [[papyrus]] scroll]]
One of the most important   professionals in ancient Egypt was a person educated in the arts of writing (both [[hieroglyphics]] and [[hieratic]] scripts, as well as the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script from the second half of the first millennium BCE, which was mainly used as shorthand and for commerce) and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=Who's Who in Ancient Egypt|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415154482|page=lvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damerow|first1=Peter|title=Abstraction and Representation: Essays on the Cultural Evolution of Thinking|date=1996|publisher=Kluwer|location=[[Dordrecht]]|isbn=978-0792338161|pages=188‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of scribes were brought up in the same scribal tradition, sent to school, and inherited their fathers' positions upon entering the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=David M.|title=Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature|date=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195172973|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of what is known about ancient Egypt is due to the activities of its scribes and the officials. Monumental buildings were erected under their supervision,&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemp|first1=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J. Kemp |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415235495|page=180|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrative and economic activities were documented by them, and stories from Egypt's lower classes and foreign lands survive due to scribes putting them in writing.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;{{rp|296}}

[[File:Ancient Egyptian Scribe's palette HARGM7677.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ancient Egyptian scribe's palette with five depressions for pigments and four styli]]
Scribes were considered part of the royal court, were not [[conscription|conscripted]] into the army, did not have to pay taxes, and were exempt from the heavy manual labor required of the lower classes ([[corv√©e]] labor). The scribal profession worked with painters and artisans who decorated [[relief]]s and other building works with scenes, personages, or hieroglyphic text. 

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'' and ''writings'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner sign]] Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of 'writings, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's ink-mixing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the black and red ink blocks.&lt;/div&gt; The demotic scribes used rush pens which had stems thinner than that of a reed (2 mm). The end of the rush was cut obliquely and then chewed, so that the fibers became separated. The result was a short, stiff brush which was handled in the same manner as that of a calligrapher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willy |last=Clarysse |title=Egyptian Scribes Writing Greek |journal=Chronique d'Egypte |volume=68 |issue=135‚Äì136 |date=1993 |pages=186‚Äì201 |doi=10.1484/J.CDE.2.308932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thoth]] was the god credited with the invention of writing by the ancient Egyptians. He was the scribe of the gods who held knowledge of scientific and moral laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Budge|first1=E. A. Wallis|authorlink=E. A.

==Egyptian and Mesopotamian functions==
[[File:Tablet with Cuneiform Writing.jpg|thumb|Cuneiform depiction]][[File:Egyptian - Scribe Statue of Min-nakht - Walters 22230 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|This early [[New Kingdom]] statue commemorates the scribe Minnakht ("Strength of [[Min (god)|Min]]") and demonstrates how ancient scribes read [[papyri]] ‚Äì in a seated position on the floor with the text on their lap.&lt;!-- [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].--&gt;]]

In addition to accountancy and governmental politicking, the scribal professions branched out into literature. The first stories were probably creation stories and religious texts. Other genres evolved, such as [[wisdom literature]], which were collections of the philosophical sayings from wise men. These contain the earliest recordings of societal thought and exploration of ideas in some length and detail.

In [[Mesopotamia]] during the middle to late 3rd millennium BCE, the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] originated some of this literature in the form of a series of debates. Among the list of [[Sumerian disputations]] is the ''[[Debate between bird and fish]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.5&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=j&amp;lineid=t535.p2#t535.p2 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sumerian examples include the ''[[Debate between Summer and Winter]]'' where Winter wins, and disputes between the cattle and grain, the tree and the reed, silver and copper, the pickaxe and the plough, and the millstone and the gul-gul stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ancient Egyptian version is [[Dispute between a man and his Ba|''The Dispute between a man and his Ba'']], which comes from the Middle Kingdom period.

==Judaism==
As early as the 11th century BCE, scribes in [[Ancient Israel]], were distinguished professionals who would exercise functions which today could be associated with lawyers, journalists, government ministers, judges, or financiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hebrew.htm |title=Hebrew language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scribes also copied documents, but this was not necessarily part of their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael D.|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195046458|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Tomb of Ezekiel.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish scribes at the Tomb of Ezekiel in Iraq, ca. 1914]]
The Jewish scribes used the following rules and procedures while creating copies of the Torah and eventually other books in the [[Tanakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scottmanning.com/content/process-of-copying-the-old-testament-by-jewish-scribes/ |title=Process of copying the Old Testament by Jewish Scribes |last=Manning |first=Scott |date=17 March 2007 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Historian on the Warpath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# They could only use clean animal skins, both to write on, and even to bind manuscripts.
# Each column of writing could have no less than forty-eight, and no more than sixty lines.
# The ink must be black, and of a special recipe.
# They must say each word aloud while they were writing.
# They must wipe the pen and wash their entire bodies before writing the most Holy Name of God, [[YHVH]], every time they wrote it.
# There must be a review within thirty days, and if as many as three pages required corrections, the entire manuscript had to be redone.
# The letters, words, and paragraphs had to be counted, and the document became invalid if two letters touched each other. The middle paragraph, word and letter must correspond to those of the original document.
# The documents could be stored only in sacred places (synagogues, etc.).
# As no document containing God's Word could be destroyed, they were stored, or buried, in a [[genizah]].
===Sofer===
{{main|Sofer (scribe)}}
Sofers ({{lang-he|◊°◊ï◊§◊® ◊°◊™‚Äù◊ù}}) are among the few scribes that still ply their trade by hand, writing on [[parchment]]. Renowned [[calligrapher]]s, they produce the [[Hebrew]] [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] and other holy texts.
====Accuracy====
{{further|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

Until 1948, the oldest known manuscripts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] dated back to CE 895. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some scrolls dated between 100 BCE and CE 100, inside a cave west of the [[Dead Sea]]. Over the next decade, more scrolls were found in caves and the discoveries became known collectively as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Every book in the [[Hebrew Bible]] was represented except [[Esther]]. Numerous copies of each book were discovered, including 25 copies of the book of [[Deuteronomy]].

While there are other items found among the Dead Sea Scrolls not currently in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and many variations and errors occurred while they were copied down, the texts on the whole testify to the accuracy of the scribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=A History of the Jews|date=1993|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=978-1857990966|page=91|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea Scrolls are currently the best route of comparison to the accuracy and consistency of translation for the [[Hebrew Bible]] because they are the oldest out of any [[Bible|Biblical text]] currently known.
====Corrections by the scribes and editing biblical literature====
Priests who took over the leadership of the Jewish community preserved and edited biblical literature. Biblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests' political and religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/origins-written-bible.html |title=Origins of the Written Bible |first=William M. |last=Schniedewind |author-link=William M. Schniedewind |date=18 November 2008 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=[[PBS Online]] |publisher=Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrections by the scribes ([[Tiqqun soferim|Tikkunei Soferim]]) refers to changes that were made in the original wording of the Hebrew Bible wording during the second temple period, perhaps sometime between 450 and 350 BCE. One of the most prominent men at this time was [[Ezra|Ezra the scribe]]. He also hired scribes to work for him, in order to write down and revise the oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksnthoughts.com/ezra-changed-the-torah-text/ |title=Ezra changed the Torah text |first=Israel |last=Drazin |date=26 August 2015 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Jewish Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ezra and the scribes had completed the writing, Ezra gathered the Jews who had returned from exile, all of whom belonged to [[Kohen|Kohanim]] families. Ezra read them an unfamiliar version of the Torah. This version was different from the Torah of their fathers. Ezra did not write a new bible. Through the genius of his ‚Äòediting‚Äô he presented the religion in a new light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Okouneff |title=The Wrong Scribe: The Scribe Who Revised the King David Story |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3XFdjwEACAAJ |publisher=[[CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform]] |date=23 January 2016 |pages=146 |editor-first=John |editor-last=Greenburg |isbn=9781523640430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-who-wrote-the-torah-1.5318582 |title=Who Wrote the Torah? |last=Gilad |first=Elon |date=22 October 2014 |access-date=9 July 2018 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe in the Middle Ages==

===Monastic scribes===
In the [[Middle Ages]] every book was made by hand. Specially trained monks, or scribes, had to carefully cut sheets of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. This was all accomplished in a monastic writing room called a [[scriptorium]] which was kept very quiet so scribes could maintain concentration.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66‚Äì67}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large scriptorium may have up to forty scribes working.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Scribes woke to morning bells before dawn and worked until the evening bells, with a lunch break in between. They worked every day except for the [[Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; The primary purpose of these scribes was to promote the ideas of the Christian Church, so they mostly copied classical and religious works. The scribes were required to copy works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew whether or not they understood the language.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;These re-creations were often written in calligraphy and featured rich illustrations, making the process incredibly time consuming. Scribes had to be familiar with the writing technology as well. They had to make sure that the lines were straight and the letters were the same size in each book that they copied. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn.|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically took a scribe fifteen months to copy a Bible.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=36‚Äì38, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such books were written on parchment or vellum made from treated hides of sheep, goats, or calves. These hides were often from the monastery's own animals as monasteries were self sufficient in raising animals, growing crops, and brewing beer.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  The overall process was too extensive and costly for books to become widespread during this period.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66‚Äì67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although scribes were only able to work in daylight, due to the expense of candles and the rather poor lighting they provided, monastic scribes were still able to produce three to four pages of work per day.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; The average scribe could copy two books a year.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|page=33‚Äì34|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were expected to make at least one mistake per page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Female Scribes===
Women also played a role as scribes in Anglo-Saxon England, as religious women in convents and schools were literate. Excavations at medieval convents have uncovered [[styli]], indicating that writing and copying were done at those locations.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/women-scribes-the-technologists-of-the-middle-ages/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female pronouns are used in prayers in manuscripts from the late 8th century, suggesting that the manuscripts were originally written by and for female scribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/03/female-scribes-in-early-manuscripts-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Town scribe==
The scribe was a common job in medieval towns during the 10th and 11th centuries. Many would be employed at scriptoria owned by local schoolmasters or lords. These scribes would be working under deadlines to complete commissioned works such as historic chronicles or poetry. Because parchment was quite costly, the scribe would often create a draft of the work first on a wax or chalk tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. (2009). ''The Library: An Illustrated History.'' Skyhorse Publishing: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- NOTE: This section was titled "Etymology and definitions," but as the etymology material is defining sexual intercourse, and there is little material on the etymology, it seemed there was no need to separate it from the other definitions; the heading was subsequently shortened to "Definitions" and added as a subsection of the Behaviors section (since it involves general views, and researchers' views, on sexual intercourse/sexual activity definitions and how people behave with regard to them). Per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, "Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading."--&gt;

''Sexual intercourse'' may be called ''coitus'', ''copulation'', ''coition'', or ''intercourse'' (the last of which is typically shorthand for ''sexual intercourse''). ''Coitus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''coitio'' or ''coire'', meaning "a coming together or joining together" or "to go together", and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile‚Äìvaginal penetration.&lt;ref name="Coitus"&gt;

===Bonding===
{{See also|Human mating strategies|Pair bond}}
Copulation ranges from a purely reproductive activity to one of emotional bonding. For example, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general often play a strong role in [[human bonding]].&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of [[birth control]] (contraception), sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

In humans and [[bonobo]]s, the female undergoes relatively [[concealed ovulation]] so that male and female partners commonly do not know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One possible reason for this distinct biological feature may be formation of strong emotional bonds between sexual partners important for social interactions and, in the case of humans, long-term partnership rather than immediate sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reis"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Harry T.

The resulting cooperation encourages collective tasks that promote the survival of each member of the group.&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt;

===Stimulation===
Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity can encompass various [[sexually stimulating]] factors ([[Stimulus (physiology)|physiological stimulation]] or [[Stimulus (psychology)|psychological stimulation]]), including different [[sex position]]s or the use of [[sex toy]]s.&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taormino |first=Tristan |authorlink=Tristan Taormino |title=The Big Book of Sex Toys|publisher=Quiver|year=2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2014|page=52|isbn=978-1-59233-355-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hfly-iMkWRkC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreplay may precede some sexual activities, often leading to [[sexual arousal]] of the partners and resulting in the erection of the [[Human penis|penis]] or [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] of the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011|pages=384‚Äì386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT421 |author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S.

In most mammals, the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation. Copulation corresponds to a succession of [[Instinct|innate]] sexual reflexes: [[erection]], vaginal lubrication, [[lordosis behavior]], immobilization, intromission, [[pelvic thrust]] and [[ejaculation]]. These copulatory [[Reflex arc|reflexes]] are controlled by [[hormone]]s and facilitated by sexual [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Plant"&gt;Plant T., Zeleznik A. (2015).

Anal sex involves stimulation of the [[Human anus|anus]], anal cavity, sphincter valve or [[rectum]]; it most commonly means the insertion of a man's penis into another person's rectum, but may also mean the use of sex toys or fingers to penetrate the anus, or oral sex on the anus ([[anilingus]]), or [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|author =Barry R.

Oral sex consists of all the sexual activities that involve the use of the mouth and throat to stimulate [[Sex organ|genitalia]] or anus. It is sometimes performed to the exclusion of all other forms of sexual activity, and may include the ingestion or absorption of semen (during [[fellatio]]) or vaginal fluids (during [[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamen"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Paula Kamen| title = Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution | isbn = 0814747337| publisher = [[New York University Press]]| year = 2000|pages = 74‚Äì77| accessdate=September 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9bXq3Qc4py0C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent route of the sperm from the vault of the vagina is through the [[cervix]] and into the [[uterus]], and then into the [[fallopian tube]]s. Millions of sperm are present in each ejaculation, to increase the chances of one fertilizing an egg or [[ovum]] (see [[sperm competition]]). When a fertile ovum from the female is present in the fallopian tubes, the male gamete joins with the ovum, resulting in [[fertilisation|fertilization]] and the formation of a new [[embryo]]. When a fertilized ovum reaches the uterus, it becomes implanted in the lining of the uterus (the [[endometrium]]) and a [[pregnancy]] begins.&lt;ref name="Evan Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr3"&gt;{{cite book| author = Cecie Starr|author2= Beverly McMillan|title = Human Biology| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2015 | page = 339| accessdate = December 27, 2017 |isbn = 1305445945| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lS5-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Receptive anal intercourse was infrequent among men, with approximately 7% of men aged 14 to 94 years old having said that they were a receptive partner during anal intercourse. It said that women engage in anal intercourse less commonly than men, but that the practice is not uncommon among women; it was estimated that 10% to 14% of women aged 18 to 39 years old practiced anal sex in the past 90 days, and that most of the women said they practiced it once a month or a few times a year.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

===={{anchor|sexarche}}Age at first intercourse====
The prevalence of sexual intercourse has been compared cross-culturally. In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'√©tudes d√©mographiques]] conducted a cross-cultural study titled "At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?" In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (listing [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital; the study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] to also fall into this group, though data was only available from [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bozon |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity before that time. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women; this group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] (Portugal, Greece and Romania are noted) and from [[Latin America]] (Brazil, [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched; there were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries (Poland and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered China and Vietnam to also fall into this group, though data were not available.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt; In northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual intercourse before any union formation; the study listed Switzerland, Germany and the Czech Republic as members of this group.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[Parasitism|parasites]], which are passed from person to person during sexual contact, especially penetrative sexual intercourse. Some, in particular [[HIV]] and syphilis, can also be passed in other ways, including from mother to child during pregnancy and [[childbirth]], through [[blood product]]s, and by shared [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)|publisher=World Health Organization

Untreated chlamydia infection can lead to female infertility and [[ectopic pregnancy]]. [[Human papillomavirus]] can lead to genital and [[cervical cancer]]s. [[Syphilis]] can result in [[stillbirth]]s and neonatal deaths. Untreated gonococcal infections result in [[miscarriage]]s, [[preterm birth]]s and [[Perinatal mortality|perinatal deaths]]. Infants born to mothers with untreated [[gonorrhea]] or chlamydia can develop [[neonatal conjunctivitis]] (a serious eye infection), which can lead to blindness.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"/&gt; [[Hepatitis B]] can also be transmitted through sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/HBVfaq.htm#treatment CDC Hepatitis B Information for Health Professionals] Accessed May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there are about 350 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hepatitis B|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index1.html|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where infection is suspected, early medical intervention is highly beneficial in all cases. The CDC stated "the risk of HIV transmission from an infected partner through oral sex is much less than the risk of HIV transmission from anal or vaginal sex," but that "measuring the exact risk of HIV transmission as a result of oral sex is very difficult" and that this is "because most sexually active individuals practice oral sex in addition to other forms of sex, such as vaginal and/or anal sex, when transmission occurs, it is difficult to determine whether or not it occurred as a result of oral sex or other more risky sexual activities". They added that "several co-factors may increase the risk of HIV transmission through oral sex"; this includes ulcers, [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]], genital sores, and the presence of other STIs.&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt;

In 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that 123 million women become pregnant worldwide each year, and around 87 million of those pregnancies or 70.7% are unintentional.

[[Vaginismus]] is involuntary tensing of the pelvic floor musculature, making coitus, or any form of penetration of the vagina, distressing, painful and sometimes impossible for women. It is a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, and is sometimes referred to as the ''PC muscle.'' Vaginismus can be hard to overcome because if a woman expects to experience pain during sexual intercourse, this can cause a muscle spasm, which results in painful sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Weiner2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferri"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

Sexual intercourse remains possible after major medical treatment of the reproductive organs and structures. This is especially true for women. Even after extensive gynecological surgical procedures (such as [[hysterectomy]], [[oophorectomy]], [[salpingectomy]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[hymenotomy]], [[Bartholin gland]] surgery, abscess removal, [[vestibulectomy]], [[labia minora]] reduction, [[cervical conization]], [[Surgery|surgical]] and radiological cancer treatments and chemotherapy), coitus can continue.

===Disabilities and other complications===
{{main| Sexuality and disability}}

Obstacles that those with [[disabilities]] face with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse include pain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], fatigue, [[negative body image]], stiffness, functional impairment, anxiety, reduced [[libido]], hormonal imbalance, and drug treatment or side effects. Sexual functioning has been regularly identified as a neglected area of the quality of life in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Tristano2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tristano|first1=Antonio G|title=Impact of rheumatoid arthritis on sexual function|journal=World Journal of Orthopedics|volume=5|issue=2|year=2014|page=107|issn=2218-5836|doi=10.5312/wjo.v5.i2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those that must take opioids for pain control, sexual intercourse can become more difficult.&lt;ref name="DeyoVon Korff2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deyo|first1=R.

The [[mentally disabled]] also are subject to challenges in participating in sexual intercourse. Women with Intellectual disabilities (ID) are often presented with situations that prevent sexual intercourse. This can include the lack of a knowledgeable healthcare provider trained and experienced in counseling those with ID on sexual intercourse.  Those with ID may have hesitations regarding the discussion of the topic of sex, a lack of sexual knowledge and limited opportunities for sex education.  In addition there are other barriers such as a higher prevalence of sexual abuse and assault.  These crimes often remain underreported.  There remains a lack of "dialogue around this population's human right to consensual sexual expression, undertreatment of menstrual disorders, and legal and systemic barriers". Women with ID may lack sexual health care and sex education.  They may not recognize sexual abuse. Consensual sexual intercourse is not always an option for some.  Those with ID may have limited knowledge and access to contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections and cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="GreenwoodWilkinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=Nechama W.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Joanne|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health Care for Women with Intellectual Disabilities: A Primary Care Perspective|journal=International Journal of Family Medicine|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1‚Äì8|issn=2090-2042|doi=10.1155/2013/642472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social effects==

===Adults===
Some researchers, such as [[Alex Comfort]], posit three potential advantages or social effects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive; these are reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comfort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Comfort|first=Alex|authorlink = Alex Comfort|title = The New Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking | publisher = Diane Publishing Company | year = 1991 | pages = 253 pages| accessdate = August 16, 2013 |isbn = 0756783526| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nfijPQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the development of the birth control pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid to late 20th century increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, they still significantly overlap and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have sexual intercourse while contracepting not only to experience sexual pleasure (recreational), but also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This couple may emphasize different aspects of sexual intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of sexual intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).&lt;ref name="Comfort"/&gt;

[[Sexual dissatisfaction]] due to the lack of sexual intercourse is associated with increased risk of [[divorce]] and relationship dissolution, especially for men.&lt;ref name="Munck"&gt;{{cite book| author = Victor C.

For women, there is often a complaint about the lack of their spouses' sexual spontaneity. Decreased sexual activity among these women may be the result of their perceived failure to maintain ideal [[physical attractiveness]] or because their sexual partners' health issues have hindered sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Montemurro"&gt;{{cite book| author = Beth Montemurro|title =Deserving Desire: Women's Stories of Sexual Evolution|publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] | year = 2014 | page = 169 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 0813573068| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1XVYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.&lt;ref name="Wincze"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurian"&gt;{{cite book| author = Michael Gurian|title =The Wonder of Aging: A New Approach to Embracing Life After Fifty|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2013 | page = 178 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 1476706719| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XyS5ebuXJWgC&amp;pg=PT178}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to divorce, women are more likely to divorce their spouses for a [[one-night stand]] or various infidelities if they are in less cooperative or high-conflict marriages.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt;

Research additionally indicates that non-married couples who are [[cohabiting]] engage in sexual intercourse more often than married couples, and are more likely to participate in sexual activity outside of their sexual relationships; this may be due to the "[[honeymoon]]" effect (the newness or novelty of sexual intercourse with the partner), since sexual intercourse is usually practiced less the longer a couple is married, with couples engaging in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity once or twice a week, or approximately six to seven times a month.&lt;ref name="Strong2"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bryan Strong| author2 = Theodore Cohen|title =The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society|publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2013 | page = 212 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn =1285531892| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZIWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in older age]] also affects the frequency of sexual intercourse, as older people generally engage in sexual intercourse less frequently than younger people do.&lt;ref name="Strong2"/&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality}}
Adolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives. For example, while [[teenage pregnancy]] may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the [[Precocious puberty|earlier onset of puberty]] for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready.&lt;ref name="sex lives3"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sex Lives of Teenagers| isbn=978-0-452-28260-5| last=Ponton| first=Lynn|authorlink=Lynn Ponton| year=2000| page=3| publisher=[[Dutton Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom),&lt;ref name="DiClemente"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ralph J.

Psychiatrist [[Lynn Ponton]] wrote, "All adolescents have sex lives, whether they are sexually active with others, with themselves, or seemingly not at all", and that viewing adolescent sexuality as a potentially positive experience, rather than as something inherently dangerous, may help young people develop healthier patterns and make more positive choices regarding sexual activity.&lt;ref name="sex lives3" /&gt; Researchers state that long-term romantic relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen S., Collins W.

While sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to [[religion and sexuality|religious]] and governmental laws. Some governments and religions also have strict designations of "appropriate" and "inappropriate" sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible. A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William N. Eskridge Jr. Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861‚Äì2003.

===Sexual offenses===
Sexual intercourse with a person against their will, or without their [[Consent#Sexual activity|consent]], is [[rape]], but may also be called ''[[sexual assault]]''; it is considered a serious [[criminal law|crime]] in most countries.&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation | title = Sex and Society | publisher = [[Marshall Cavendish|Marshall Cavendish Corporation]] | year = 2010 | pages = 143‚Äì144 | accessdate = August 25, 2013|isbn = 0-7614-7906-6|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;lpg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerrold S.

Most countries have [[age of consent]] laws which set the minimum legal age with whom an older person may engage in sexual intercourse, usually set at 16 to 18, but ranges from 12 to 20, years of age. In some societies, an age of consent is set by non-statutory custom or tradition.&lt;ref name="Kinnear"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen L.

Some countries treat any sex with a person of diminished or insufficient mental capacity to give consent, regardless of age, as rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed|first=E.

[[File:Slevogt Faun and a Girl.jpg .jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Slevogt]] depiction of rape]]
Robert Francoeur et al. stated that "prior to the 1970s, rape definitions of sex often included only penile-vaginal sexual intercourse."&lt;ref name="Francoeur"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] | year = 2004 | page = 173 | accessdate = April 30, 2013|isbn = 0826414885| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=PQMTzc6y8ZAC&amp;pg=PA173 | first1 = Robert T. | last1 = Francoeur | first2 = Raymond J. | last2 = Noonan | first3 = Beldina | last3 = Opiyo-Omolo | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Pamela J. Kalbfleisch and Michael J. Cody stated that this made it so that if "sex means penile-vaginal intercourse, then rape means forced penile-vaginal intercourse, and other sexual behaviors&amp;nbsp;‚Äì such as fondling a person's genitals without her or his consent, forced oral sex, and same-sex coercion&amp;nbsp;‚Äì are not considered rape"; they stated that "although some other forms of forced sexual contact are included within the legal category of sodomy (e.g., anal penetration and oral-genital contact), many unwanted sexual contacts have no legal grounding as rape in some states".&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"/&gt; Ken Plumber argued that the legal meaning "of rape in most countries is unlawful sexual intercourse which means the penis must penetrate the vagina" and that "other forms of sexual violence towards women such as forced oral sex or anal intercourse, or the insertion of other objects into the vagina, constitute the 'less serious' crime of sexual assault".&lt;ref name="Plummer"/&gt;

Over time, the meaning of rape broadened in some parts of the world to include many types of sexual penetration, including anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and penetration of the genitals or rectum by an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) still considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed the meaning from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The meaning does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level, but instead assures that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |title=An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012) |publisher= |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021145/http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=U.S. to Expand Rape Definition in Crime Statistics (New York Times, January 6, 2012)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, penetration is not required for the act to be categorized as rape.&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169‚Äì170 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most societies around the world, the concept of [[incest]] exists and is criminalized. James Roffee, a senior lecturer in criminology at [[Monash University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee(896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0).html|title=Dr James Roffee|publisher=Monash university|access-date=May 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204003059/http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee%28896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0%29.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed potential harm associated with familial sexual activity, such as resulting children born with deficiencies. However, the law is more concerned with protecting the rights of people who are potentially subjected to such abuse. This is why familial sexual relationships are criminalized, even if all parties are consensual. There are laws prohibiting all kinds of sexual activity between relatives, not necessarily penetrative sex. These laws refer to grandparents, parents, children, siblings, aunts and uncles. There are differences between states in terms of the severity of punishments and what they consider to be a relative, including biological parents, step-parents, adoptive parents and half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023]|title=Roffee, J.

====Marriage and relationships====
Sexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring [[consummation]] of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation).&lt;!-- NOTE: This is also sourced in the bullet-point examples list below.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;{{cite book| author =Margaret Monahan Hogan|title =Marriage as a Relationship: Real and Rational|publisher = [[Marquette University Press]] | year = 2002 | page = 88 | accessdate = September 1, 2015 |isbn = 0874626579| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HuztAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Marriage+as+a+Relationship:+Real+and+Rational}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for [[annulment]] (which does not require a divorce process). Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a "marital right" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;{{cite book| author =James G.

Dwyer stated that no-fault divorce laws "have made it much easier for a woman to exit a marital relationship, and wives have obtained greater control over their bodies while in a marriage" because of legislative and judicial changes regarding the concept of a marital exemption when a man rapes his wife.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"/&gt;

There are various legal positions regarding the meaning and legality of sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex or gender. For example, in the 2003 [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] case [[Blanchflower v. Blanchflower]], it was held that female same-sex sexual relations, and same-sex sexual practices in general, did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 entry in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' that categorizes sexual intercourse as coitus; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of [[adultery]].&lt;ref name="GLAD, B vs. B"&gt;{{cite web| title=Blanchflower v.

====Religious interpretations====

There are wide differences in religious views with regard to sexual intercourse in or outside of marriage:

*Most denominations of [[Christianity]], including [[Catholicism]], have strict views or rules on what sexual practices are and are not acceptable.&lt;ref name="Akin"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Daniel L.

* In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], or [[Mormonism]], sexual relations within the bonds of matrimony are seen as sacred. Mormons consider sexual relations to be ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife. Members are discouraged from having any sexual relations before marriage, and from being unfaithful to their spouses after marriage.&lt;ref name="Swatos"&gt;{{cite book| author =William H.

* In [[Judaism]], a married Jewish man is required to provide his wife with sexual pleasure called ''onah'' (literally, "her time"), which is one of the conditions he takes upon himself as part of the Jewish marriage contract, ''[[ketubah]]'', that he gives her during the Jewish wedding ceremony. In [[Jewish views on marriage]], sexual desire is not evil, but must be satisfied in the proper time, place and manner.&lt;ref name="Zilney"&gt;{{cite book| author =Laura J.

In Shi'ia Islam, men are allowed to enter into an unlimited number of temporary marriages, which are contracted to last for a period of minutes to multiple years and permit sexual intercourse. Sunni women are allowed to enter only one marriage permanently at a time whereas Shi'ia women both temporary or permanent. 
* [[Hinduism]] has varied views about sexuality, but Hindu society, in general, perceives [[extramarital sex]] to be immoral and shameful.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;Don S.

* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ethics, in its most general formulation, holds that one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure since it binds one to the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and prevents one attaining the goal of [[Nirvana]]. Since Buddhist monastics (i.e. [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s) are to be fully dedicated towards this goal, they undertake the training rule of total abstinence from sexual intercourse, i.e. of celibacy. Other monastic training rules from the Code of Discipline ([[Patimokkha]] or Pratimoksasutra) and canonical [[Vinaya]] scriptures are to prevent masturbation, lustfully touching and speaking to members of the other sex, and other forms of sexual behaviour. Buddhist lay people undertake the [[Five Precepts]], the third of which is avoiding sexual misconduct. Peter Harvey says that this precept "relates primarily to the avoidance of causing suffering by one's sexual behaviour. Adultery‚Äî'going with the wife of another'‚Äîis the most straightforward breach of this precept. The wrongness of this is seen as partly in terms of its being an expression of greed, and partly in terms of its harm to others. It is said that a man breaks the precept if he has intercourse with women who are engaged, or who are still protected by any relative, or young girls not protected by a relative, Clearly, rape and incest are breaches of the precept."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''. Cambridge, 2000: 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist Canonical scriptures contain no other regulations or recommendations for lay people‚Äîfor example, with regards homosexuality, masturbation, sexual practices and contraceptives. However, in keeping with the Buddhist ethical principles of not-harming and avoiding shame, guilt and remorse, socially taboo forms of sexuality as well as obsessive sexual activities can also be seen as being included in the third precept. Later Buddhist authors such as [[Nagarjuna]] give various clarifications and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''.

*[[Meher Baba]] maintained that "In the beginning of married life the partners are drawn to each other by lust as well as love; but with conscious and deliberate cooperation they can gradually lessen the element of lust and increase the element of love. Through this process of sublimation, lust ultimately gives place to deep love."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1995). ''Discourses''. Myrtle Beach: Sheriar Press. p. 109. {{ISBN|9781880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the sexual intercourse between two people is seen as counter to religious law or doctrine. In many religious communities, including the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Bhikkhu|Mahayana Buddhists]], religious leaders are expected to refrain from sexual intercourse in order to devote their full attention, energy, and loyalty to their religious duties.&lt;ref&gt;William Skudlarek.

In [[zoology]], ''copulation'' often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copulation1"/&gt; [[Spider]]s have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large [[pedipalp]]s, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can store sperm indefinitely.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Spiders"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E. | author2=Fox, R.S. | author3=Barnes, R.D. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571‚Äì584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals that live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate vaginally, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book| author =Cecie Starr| author2 =Christine Evers| author3 =Lisa Starr|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Biology: A Human Emphasis|publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2010 | pages = 630‚Äì631| accessdate = December 9, 2010 |isbn =1133170056| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denecke"&gt;{{cite book| author =Edward J.

For primitive [[insect]]s, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book| author =M.

Bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins are species known to engage in heterosexual behaviors even when the female is not in estrus, which is a point in her reproductive cycle suitable for successful impregnation. These species are also known to [[Homosexual behavior in animals|engage in same-sex sexual behaviors]].&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt; In these animals, the use of sexual intercourse has evolved beyond reproduction&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt; to apparently serve additional social functions (such as bonding).&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]

'''Sheela na gigs''' are figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated [[vulva]]. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found all over [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; on [[church (building)|churches]], [[castles]], and other buildings. The highest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; McMahon and Roberts cite 101 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts ‚Äì An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland.  There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, √âamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840‚Äì44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''S√≠le'' and ''S√≠la''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''S√≠le na gc√≠och'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 ‚Äì The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Se√°n-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

J√∏rgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gC√≠och'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''S√≠le ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''S√≠le,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''S√≠le na gC√≠oƒã'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Focl√≥ir Gae·∏ãlge agus B√©arla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|…° ≤iÀê|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types‚Äîmale, female, and bestial‚Äîare frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===
[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|text-top|thumb|right|La Fontaine plate, illustrated by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] (1762)]]
Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar Gonz√°lez-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar Gonz√°lez|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102‚Äì118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29‚Äì50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance‚Äîa gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167‚Äì194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

The following countries are known to have (or have had) churches with female exhibitionist figures on them:&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

A significant number of the figures are found in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] contexts,&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; especially in France, northern Spain, Britain, and Norway. In Ireland figures commonly are found in areas of Norman influence.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO‚Äôs contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] ‚Äì a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">The '''Tanner scale''' (also known as the '''Tanner stages''') is a scale of [[Child development|physical development in children]], [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, such as the size of the [[breast]]s, [[genitals]], testicular volume and development of [[Pubic hair|pubic]] hair. This scale was first identified by [[James Mourilyan Tanner|James Tanner]], a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3082|Tanner's stages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5440182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Due to [[Human variability|natural variation]], individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of [[puberty]]. In [[HIV]] treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent or pediatric).
==Definitions of stages==
Adapted from text by Lawrence Neinstein, M.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chla.org/profile/lawrence-neinstein-md Lawrence S. Neinstein, M.D.: Adolescent Medicine - Children's Hospital Los Angeles CA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307161350/http://www.chla.org/profile/lawrence-neinstein-md |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genitals (male)===
[[File:Tanner scale-male.svg|166px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for males.]]
; Tanner I
: [[Testicle|testicular]] volume less than 1.5 [[liter|ml]]; small penis (prepubertal; typically age nine and younger)
; Tanner II
: testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged (9‚Äì11)
; Tanner III
: testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen (11‚Äì12.5)
; Tanner IV
: testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length (12.5‚Äì14)
; Tanner V
: testicular volume greater than 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis (14+)

===Breasts (female)===
[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|240px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for females.]]
; Tanner  I
: no glandular tissue: [[areola]] follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: [[Thelarche|breast bud]] forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen (10‚Äì11.5)
; Tanner III
: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast (11.5‚Äì13)
; Tanner IV
: increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and [[nipple|papilla]] form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast (13‚Äì15)
; Tanner V
: breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. (15+)

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===

; Tanner I
: no pubic hair at all ([[Puberty|prepubertal]]) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]] (males) or on the [[labia majora]] (females) (10‚Äì11.5)
; Tanner III
: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5‚Äì13)
; Tanner IV
: adult‚Äìlike hair quality, extending across [[mons pubis|pubis]] but sparing medial thighs (13‚Äì15)
; Tanner V
: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs (15+)

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the [[pornography]] industry for its potential to lead to false [[child pornography]] convictions, such as in the case when United States federal authorities used it to assert that pornographic actress [[Lupe Fuentes]] was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Lupe-Fuentes-Saves-Man-From-Bogus-Child-Porn-Charge-394003.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‚ÄòChild Porn‚Äô Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.&lt;ref name="pmid9882230"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=AL|author2=Tanner, JM |title=Misuse of Tanner puberty stages to estimate chronologic age.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1998|volume=102|issue=6|page=1494|doi=10.1542/peds.102.6.1494|pmid=9882230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Congres Team 10 in Otterlo - Team 10 Meeting in Otterlo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Otterlo]] Meeting 1959 (also CIAM '59), organized by Team 10, 43 participants. Meeting place: [[Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]]. Dissolution of the organization CIAM.]]
'''Team 10''' ‚Äî just as often referred to as '''Team X''' or '''Team Ten''' ‚Äî was a group of architects and other invited participants who assembled starting in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of the [[Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM)]] and created a schism within CIAM by challenging its doctrinaire approach to [[urbanism]].

==Membership==
The group's first formal meeting under the name of Team 10 took place in [[Bagnols-sur-C√®ze]] in 1960. The last, with only four members present, was in Lisbon in 1981.

Team 10's core group consists of [[Pancho Guedes]], Rolf Gutmann, [[Geir Grung (architect)|Geir Grung]], Oskar Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, L. ed., Team 10 East. Revisionist Architecture in Real Existing Modernism (Warsaw: Museum of Modern Art/ Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reima Pietil√§]], Charles Polonyi, Brian Richards, [[Jerzy Soltan]], [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]], [[John Voelcker]], and Stefan Wewerka.

They referred to themselves as "a small family group of architects who have sought each other out because each has found the help of the others necessary to the development and understanding of their own individual work."&lt;ref name="alison"&gt;Smithson, Alison [ed] ''Team 10 Primer'', [[MIT Press|The MIT Press]], (1968), {{ISBN|0-289-79556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team 10's theoretical framework, disseminated primarily through teaching and publications, had a profound influence on the development of architectural thought in the second half of the 20th century, primarily in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Two different movements emerged from Team 10: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).

==History==
Team 10's core group started meeting within the context of CIAM, the international platform for modern architects founded in 1928.&lt;ref name="Team10online Intro"&gt;http://www.team10online.org [http://www.team10online.org/team10/introduction.html ''Introduction - The Team 10 story''] by Max Risselada &amp; Dirk van den Heuvel.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Progressivism}}
{{Transhumanism}}
'''Techno-progressivism''' or '''tech-progressivism'''{{cn|date=March 2016}} is a stance of active support for the [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of [[technological change]] and [[social change]]. Techno-progressives argue that technological developments can be profoundly [[empowerment|empowering]] and [[freedom (political)|emancipatory]] when they are regulated by legitimate [[democracy|democratic]] and [[accountable]] authorities to ensure that their [[social cost|cost]]s, [[risk]]s and [[cost-benefit analysis|benefits]] are all fairly shared by the actual [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] to those developments.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  The Trouble with "Transhumanism": Part Two|    date = 2004 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20041222/| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    date = 2005 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20060812/| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stance==
Techno-progressivism maintains that accounts of [[Progress (history)|progress]] should focus on [[Scientific consensus|scientific]] and [[Technological change|technical]] dimensions, as well as [[ethics of technology|ethical]] and [[technology and society|social]] ones.  For most techno-progressive perspectives, then, the growth of scientific knowledge or the accumulation of technological powers will not represent the achievement of proper progress unless and until it is accompanied by a [[distributive justice|just distribution]] of the [[externality|costs, risks, and benefits]] of these new knowledges and capacities.  At the same time, for most techno-progressive [[social criticism|critic]]s and [[advocacy|advocates]], the achievement of [[participatory democracy|better democracy]], greater [[social justice|fairness]], less violence, and a wider [[civil libertarianism|rights culture]] are all desirable, but inadequate in themselves to confront the quandaries of contemporary technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by [[scientific progress|progress in science]] and technology to support and implement these values.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Strong techno-progressive positions include support for the [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify]] his or her own [[cognitive liberty|mind]] and [[morphological freedom|body]], on his or her own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[biomedical technology]].&lt;ref name="Carrico 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  The Politics of Morphological Freedom|    date = 2006 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2006/08/politics-of-morphological-freedom.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}}

During the November 2014 [[Humanity+|Transvision Conference]], many of the leading [[transhumanist]] organizations signed the Technoprogressive Declaration. The Declaration stated the values of technoprogressivism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/tpdec2014 Technoprogressive Declaration - Transvision 2014, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting stance==
{{Cleanup|reason=This section should move to [[Transhumanist politics]]|date=February 2018}}
{{Main article|Bioconservatism}}
[[Bioconservatism]] (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "[[biology]]" and "[[conservatism]]") is a stance of hesitancy about technological development especially if it is perceived to threaten a given [[social order]]. Strong bioconservative positions include opposition to [[Genetic engineering|genetic modification]] of [[transgenic plants|food crops]], the [[cloning]] and genetic engineering of [[livestock]] and [[pets]], and, most prominently, rejection of the genetic, prosthetic, and cognitive modification of human beings to overcome what are broadly perceived as current human biological and cultural limitations.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Bioconservatives range in political perspective from [[right-wing politics|right-leaning]] religious and cultural [[conservatism|conservatives]] to [[left-wing politics|left-leaning]] [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] and [[appropriate technology|technology critics]]. What unifies bioconservatives is skepticism about [[medical]] and other [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] transformations of the [[biosphere|living world]].&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won‚Äôt Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mander, Jerry (1991). ‚Äò‚ÄôIn the Absence of the Sacred: The Failure of Technology and the Survival of the Indian Nations,‚Äô‚Äô, Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy (1998). ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Biotech Century: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World,‚Äô‚Äô Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vandana (2000). ‚Äò‚ÄôStolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply,‚Äô‚Äô South End Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically less sweeping as a critique of technological society than [[Neo-Luddism|bioluddism]], the bioconservative perspective is characterized by its defense of the [[natural]], deployed as a [[moral]] category.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Although techno-progressivism is the stance which contrasts with bioconservatism in the [[biopolitical]] spectrum, both techno-progressivism and bioconservatism, in their more moderate expressions, share an opposition to unsafe, unfair, undemocratic forms of technological development, and both recognize that such developmental modes can facilitate unacceptable [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]], exacerbate injustice and incubate dangerous social discontent.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

The '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:
* '''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) ‚Äì This was defined by Fred Davis as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]".
* '''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) ‚Äì Davis defined this as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}).
The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded‚Äîthe two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} &amp; {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).

==History==

TAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989)
is the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology
(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747‚Äì768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&amp;mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).

Bagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:

:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})

Earlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms "task fit" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.

==Usage==
Several researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.

Segars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.

Mark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2√ó2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).
The TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604‚Äì634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Venkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).

In an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal

==Alternative models==
# The '''MPT model''': Independent of TAM, Scherer ({{harvnb|Scherer|1986}}) developed the [[matching person and technology model]] in 1986 as part of her National Science Foundation-funded dissertation research. The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), "Living in the State of Stuck", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.
# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.
# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments
|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238‚Äì247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
TAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a "theory" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM "has diverted researchers' attention away from other 
important research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the 
independent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29‚Äì47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).

Legris et al.&lt;ref&gt;Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.

Perceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).

A study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. &amp; Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.

A '''tondo''' (plural "tondi" or "tondos") is a [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] term for a [[Circle|circular]] work of art, either a [[painting]] or a [[sculpture]]. The word derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rotondo,'' "round."  The term is usually not used in English for small round paintings, but only those over about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (two feet) in diameter, thus excluding many round [[portrait miniature]]s ‚Äì for sculpture the threshold is rather lower.

==History==
Artists have created tondi since [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The circular paintings in the centre of [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|painted vases]] of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. van der Grinten, ''On the Composition of the Medallions in the Interiors of Greek Black- and Red-Figured Kylixes''. Amsterdam 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The style was revived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy, where it may have developed from the smaller [[desco da parto]] or birthing tray.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been less common. In [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape.

The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. [[Andrea della Robbia]] and other members of his family created glazed terracotta ''tondi'' that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]], Florence, 1421‚Äì24,  Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the [[spandrel]]s of the arches.

In the sixteenth century the painterly style of ''istoriato'' decoration for [[maiolica]] wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also [[Charger (table setting)|charger]]).

The tondo has also been used as a design element in [[architecture]] since the [[Renaissance]]; it may serve centered in the gable-end of a [[pediment]] or under the round-headed [[arch]] that was revived in the fifteenth century.

Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from [[Champmol]]  (of a ''Piet√°'' by [[Jean Malouel]] of 1400-15, now in the [[Louvre]]), the tondo became fashionable in 15th century [[Florence]], with [[Botticelli]] painting many examples, both [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and narrative scenes.  [[Michelangelo]] employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including ''The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist'', the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/michelangelo/holy_family.jpg.html|title=Michelangelo, The Doni Tondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Raphael]].

The infrequently-encountered synonym ''[[rondo]]''&lt;ref name="Artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/  Artlex.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; much more usually refers to a musical form.

'''Trophic State Index (TSI)''' is a classification system designed to rate bodies of water based on the amount of biological activity they sustain.&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas"&gt;{{cite web |last1=University of Southern Florida Water Institute |title=Trophic State Index (TSI) |url=http://www.lake.wateratlas.usf.edu/shared/learnmore.asp?toolsection=lm_tsi |website=Learn More About Trophic State Index (TSI) - Lake.WaterAtlas.org |publisher=University of Southern Florida |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "trophic index" is commonly applied to lakes, any surface body of water may be indexed.

The TSI of a body of water is rated on a scale from zero to one hundred.&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas" /&gt; Under the TSI scale, bodies of water may be defined as:&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas" /&gt; 

* '''oligotrophic''' (TSI 0‚Äì40, having the least amount of biological productivity, "good" water quality);
* '''mesoeutrophic''' (TSI 40‚Äì60, having a moderate level of biological activity, "fair" water quality); or
* '''eutrophic''' to '''hypereutrophic''' (TSI 60‚Äì100, having the highest amount of biological activity, "poor" water quality).

The quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and other biologically useful nutrients are the primary determinants of a body of water's TSI. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be [[limiting resource]]s in standing water bodies, so increased concentrations tend to result in increased plant growth, followed by corollary increases in subsequent [[trophic level]]s.{{efn|Note that this use of trophic levels refers to feeding dynamics, and has a much different meaning than a body of water's ''trophic index''.}} Consequently, a body of water's trophic index may sometimes be used to make a rough estimate of its biological condition.&lt;ref name="USEPA"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (2007) Carlson's Trophic State Index. ''Aquatic Biodiversity''. http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/aquatic/carlson.html ''accessed 17 February 2008''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlson's Trophic State Index==
Carlson's index was proposed by Robert Carlson in his 1977 seminal paper, "A trophic state index for lakes".&lt;ref name="Carlson1977" /&gt; It is one of the more commonly used trophic indices and is the trophic index used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt; The ''trophic state'' is defined as the total weight of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in a given water body at the time of measurement. Because they are of public concern, the Carlson index uses the algal biomass as
an objective classifier of a lake or other water body's trophic status.&lt;ref name="Carlson1977"&gt;Carlson,  R.E. (1977) A trophic state index for lakes. ''Limnology and Oceanography''. 22:2 361‚Äì369.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US EPA, the Carlson Index should only be used with lakes that have relatively few rooted plants and non-algal turbidity sources.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Index variable===
Because they tend to correlate, three independent variables can be used to calculate the Carlson Index: ''[[chlorophyll|chlorophyll pigments]]'', ''total phosphorus'' and ''[[Secchi depth]]''. Of these three, chlorophyll will probably yield the most accurate measures, as it is the most accurate predictor of biomass. Phosphorus may be a more accurate estimation of a water body's summer trophic status than
chlorophyll if the measurements are made during the winter. Finally, the Secchi depth is probably the least accurate measure, but also the most affordable and expedient one. Consequently, citizen monitoring programs and other volunteer or large-scale surveys will often use the Secchi depth. By translating the Secchi transparency values to a log base 2 scale, each successive doubling of biomass is represented as a whole integer index number.&lt;ref name="Carlson1996"&gt;Carlson R.E. and J. Simpson (1996) A Coordinator's Guide to Volunteer Lake Monitoring Methods. ''North American Lake Management Society''. 96 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secchi depth, which measures water transparency, indicates the concentration of dissolved and particulate material in the water, which in turn can be used to derive the biomass. This relationship is expressed in the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac 1 z \right)\left(\ln \frac{I_0}{I_z}\right) = k_w + \alpha C&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''z'' = the depth at which the disk disappears,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity of light striking the water's surface,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is about 10% of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and is considered a constant,
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; is a coefficient for the attenuation of light by water and dissolved substances,
:''&amp;alpha;'' is treated as a constant with the units of square meters per milligram and
:''C'' is the concentration of particulate matter in units for milligrams per cubic meter.&lt;ref name="Carlson1977" /&gt;

==Trophic classifications==
A lake is usually classified as being in one of three possible classes: ''oligotrophic'', ''mesotrophic'' or ''eutrophic''. Lakes with extreme trophic indices may also be considered ''hyperoligotrophic'' or ''hypereutrophic''. The table below demonstrates how the index values translate into trophic classes.

Oligotrophic lakes generally host very little or no [[aquatic plant|aquatic vegetation]] and are relatively clear, while eutrophic lakes tend to host large quantities of organisms, including algal blooms. Each trophic class supports different types of fish and other organisms, as well. If the algal biomass in a lake or other water body reaches too high a concentration (say &gt;80 TSI), massive [[fish die-off]]s may occur as decomposing biomass deoxygenates the water.

===Oligotrophic===
[[File:20161001 Kurtkowiec i Czerwone Stawy GƒÖsienicowe 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Kurtkowiec Lake]], an oligotrophic lake in the [[Tatra Mountains]] of southern [[Poland]]]]

An oligotrophic lake is a lake with low [[primary productivity]], as a result of low [[nutrient]] content. These lakes have low [[algal]] production, and consequently, often have very clear waters, with high [[drinking water|drinking-water]] quality. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have ample [[oxygen]]; thus, such lakes often support many [[fish]] species such as [[lake trout]], which require cold, well-[[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenated]] waters. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, owing to their larger [[hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] volume.

Ecologists use the term [[oligotroph]]ic to distinguish unproductive lakes, characterised by nutrient deficiency, from productive, eutrophic lakes, with an ample or excessive nutrient supply. Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold regions underlain by resistant [[igneous]] rocks (especially [[granitic]] bedrock).

===Mesotrophic===
Mesotrophic lakes are lakes with an intermediate level of productivity. These lakes are commonly clear water lakes and ponds with beds of submerged aquatic plants and medium levels of nutrients.

The term mesotrophic is also applied to terrestrial habitats. Mesotrophic soils have moderate nutrient levels.

===Eutrophic===
{{Main|Eutrophication}}
[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|upright|Algal bloom in a village river in the mountains near [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], China]]

A eutrophic body of water, commonly a lake or pond, has high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. Usually, the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When aquatic plants dominate, the water tends to be clear. When algae dominate, the water tends to be darker. The algae engage in photosynthesis which supplies oxygen to the fish and biota which inhabit these waters. Occasionally, an excessive algal bloom will occur and can ultimately result in fish death, due to respiration by algae and bottom-living bacteria. The process of [[eutrophication]] can occur naturally and by [[human impact on the environment]].

Eutrophic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''eutrophos'' meaning "well-nourished", from ''eu'' meaning good and ''trephein'' meaning "to nourish"&lt;ref&gt;Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eutrophic eutrophic] at [[dictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypereutrophic===
Hypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes characterized by frequent and severe nuisance [[algal blooms]] and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than 3 feet, they have greater than 40 micrograms/litre total [[chlorophyll]] and greater than 100 micrograms/litre [[phosphorus]].

The excessive algal blooms can also significantly reduce oxygen levels and prevent life from functioning at lower depths creating dead zones beneath the surface.

Likewise, large algal blooms can cause [[biodilution]] to occur, which is a decrease in the concentration of a pollutant with an increase in [[trophic level]]. This is opposed to [[biomagnification]] and is due to a decreased concentration from increased algal uptake.

==Trophic index drivers==
Both natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors can influence a lake or other water body's trophic index. A water body situated in a nutrient-rich region with high [[net primary productivity]] may be naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies from [[non-point sources]] such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.

==Management targets==
Often, the desired trophic index differs between stakeholders. Water-fowl enthusiasts (e.g. duck hunters) may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support a large population of waterfowl. Residents, though, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural resource agencies are generally responsible for reconciling these conflicting uses and determining what a water body's trophic index should be.

== History ==
Plans for the creation of this public university were first developed at the 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], but when the State of [[California]] was established in 1850, it lacked the funds necessary to create such a school. Missionaries sent west by the [[American Home Missionary Society|Home Mission Society]] of New York, however, created the [[College of California]] and eventually transferred its ownership to the State in 1855.

By 1862, the State had secured the land necessary to establish a college as a result of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act.]] This college was known as the Agricultural Mining and Mechanical Arts College, and opened formally in 1866.

On March 23, 1868, [[Henry Huntly Haight|Governor H.H. Haight]] combined the resources of this college with the College of California to create the first [[University of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/daniel_gilman.html|title=Daniel Coit Gilman and the Early Years of UC - Special Topics - A History of UCSF|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Regents began admitting women to the University of California in 1871, and the first woman to graduate was Rosa L. Scrivner, with a [[Bachelor of Philosophy|PhB]] in Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/graduates00univ/graduates00univ_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Graduates, 1864-1905. November 1905"|website=www.archive.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Cnr campus.png|thumb|Wellman Hall, flanked by Giannini and Hilgard Halls.]]

== Campus ==
[[File:Cnr map.png|thumb|The original College of Agriculture consisted of the Hilgard, Wellman, and Giannini halls. Today, CNR has expanded to occupy the Koshland, Morgan, and Mulford buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/site/forms/pdf/CNR_Report.pdf|title=College of Natural Resources|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Forms &amp; Petitions|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The College of Natural Resources is located on the northwest end of the UC Berkeley campus, and comprises six main buildings.

These include the historic group of Wellman, Hilgard, and Giannini halls that composed the original college. This trio, known as the Agriculture Complex, is the most unified grouping of buildings on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=William|last2=Knapp|first2=Frederic|date=2012-01-01|title=Hilgard Hall (John Galen Howard) Historic Structures Report|url=https://works.bepress.com/williamriggs/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are visually unified by a Mediterranean landscape of olive and stone pine trees.

The first hall, Wellman, is a Classical Revival building designed in 1912 by [[John Galen Howard]] and named after [[Harry R. Wellman]], a professor of Agricultural Economics, and acting president of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb7t1nb4v2&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00071&amp;toc.id=|title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1997|website=texts.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilgard was constructed six years later by the same architect, and named after [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], professor of Agricultural Chemistry and father of modern soil science. Its neo-classical design is inscribed with the phrase "''To Rescue for Human Society the Native Values of Rural Life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noehill.com/alameda/nat1982004647.asp|title=National Register #82004647: Hilgard Hall on UC Berkeley Campus, California|website=noehill.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giannini Hall was designed by Howard's co-worker, William Charles Hays, through an endowment from the Bancitaly Corporation (now known as [[Bank of America]]) in memory of their founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]].

The '''USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies''' ('''WIES''') is an environmental research and education facility run by the [[University of Southern California]].  It is an organized research unit that encompasses a wide range of faculty and topics across the university as well as operating a marine laboratory at the edge of [[Two Harbors, California]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] approximately 22 miles (35 km) south-southwest of [[Los Angeles]].  

The USC Wrigley Institute has specialized programs in environmental microbiology, geobiology, ocean biogeochemistry, living marine resources (including fisheries and aquaculture), climate change, coastal environmental quality and the urban ocean.  The Institute is also home to the USC Sea Grant Program, part of the [[National Sea Grant Program]] through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

The mission of the Wrigley Institute is to encourage responsible and creative decisions in society by providing an objective source of [[environmental science]], and to foster an understanding of the natural world among people of all ages.  The faculty conduct academic research that is both good basic science and directly relevant to the needs of society.  The Institute operates a "K-gray" educational program with extensive outreach into the major student populations of greater Los Angeles.  It also creates real linkages between the academic scholarship and decision-making in society.

The Catalina Island facility centers around the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center (WMSC).  This {{convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus on Catalina Island includes, a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} laboratory building, a dormitory and cottage-style housing, a cafeteria, a [[Hyperbaric oxygen therapy|hyperbaric chamber]], and a large waterfront staging area complete with dock, pier, helipad, moorings, boats and diving lockers.  The Institute lies adjacent to Big Fisherman's Cove, a no-take protected refuge.&lt;ref name="Protect our Oceans"&gt;[http://dornsife.usc.edu/enst-320a/water-and-soil/?p=342 Protect Our Oceans], Description of Big Fisherman's Cove MPA status.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to facilities for researchers and graduate students, the campus is home of USC's Catalina Semester, a 15-week intensive program in marine and environmental studies, as well as educational programs for pre-college students, families, executives and senior citizens.  It is one of a handful of marine laboratories in the United States that is specifically open to students and faculty from other institutions.

USC opened its first facility on the island in 1965 after a grant of more than {{convert|14|acre|m2}} of land to USC by the [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley]] family.  The Science Center is named after [[Philip K. Wrigley]], the son of the founder of the famous gum company.  The Wrigley Institute was founded in 1995 after a donation by [[William Wrigley III|William and Julie Wrigley]].

In the summer 2007, USC began work on installing six pre-built 48-ton, {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|-1|sing=on}} Tuscan-style houses to the island to house prominent scientists and corporate executives so they would not be placed in the standard dormitories.&lt;ref name=LAT080307&gt;Louis Sahagun, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-catalina3aug03,1,5242952.story Homes readied to set sail], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The homes would add over 20 rooms, and transportation to the remote campus involved both barges to transport them across the {{convert|22|mi|km|0|sing=on}} ocean channel and heavy cranes to pull the houses up the hill to their final location.&lt;ref name=LAT080307&gt;Louis Sahagun, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-catalina3aug03,1,5242952.story Homes readied to set sail], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

USC provides regular semi-weekly boat transportation to the facility from the [[Southern California Marine Institute]] on [[Terminal Island]].&lt;ref name="Transportation Information"&gt;[http://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/transportation/ Transportation Information], WMSC Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VinylPlus''' was founded by the European Council of Vinyl Manufacturers (ECVM), the European Stabiliser Producers Association (ESPA), European Plasticisers and the European Plastics Converters (EuPC) in 2011 when the [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] industry renewed a previous initiative called Vinyl 2010. VinylPlus is a ten-year, industry-wide voluntary commitment to develop more ecologically responsible ways to produce, use and recycle PVC. The programme aligns with the principles and targets of the [[United Nations|UN]]‚Äôs [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and the [[circular economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=91|title=VinylPlus - United Nations Partnerships for SDGs platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VinylPlus includes all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters and recyclers. It covers the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland.

VinylPlus is included in the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] Registry of Commitments, and is a member of the Green Industry Platform, the global partnership led by the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)]] and the United Nations Environment Platform Programme (UNEP). VinylPlus is also registered as a partner on the UN Partnerships for SDGs platform where it is recognised as fulfilling the SMART criteria. 

== History ==
VinylPlus succeeded Vinyl 2010, which was the European PVC industry‚Äôs first voluntary commitment. Vinyl 2010 was set up in 2000 around the principles of [[Responsible Care]] adopted by the European chemicals industry in the 1980s . Its programme aimed to shift the PVC industry to a more sustainable model by improving recycling and substituting hazardous additives.

At the same time, the [[European Union]] also started addressing environmental concerns about plastics, notably developing the [[Waste framework directive|Waste Framework Directive]] (EU Directive 2008/98/EC), which laid down key EU recycling rules.

Vinyl 2010 also set up a monitoring committee, which was kept upon the creation of VinylPlus. The committee was designed as an independent verification of the programme‚Äôs activities, and includes representatives from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Parliament]], trade unions, consumer associations, academia and members of the European 

== Progress Report ==
VinylPlus publishes an annual Progress Report summarising progress and data. Progress is measured against each of the five sustainability challenges identified for PVC. All information included in the report is presented to the Monitoring Committee and independently audited by third parties.

== Product Label ==
The VinylPlus Product Label was launched in 2018 as an identification tool.

== Recycling ==
One aspect of the programme is to Improve recycling figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vinylplus.eu/recycling/circular-economy|title=VinylPlus - The Circular Economy|website=vinylplus.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum ==
VinylPlus organises an annual forum: The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum. The first one took place in Istanbul in 2013. The event aims to encourage dialogue on sustainability by assembling representatives from the PVC industry, policy makers, consumer groups, retailers, architects, designers, recyclers and NGOs.  The themes from past forums have been:

* 2013: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth for Europe and Beyond
* 2014: Enhancing the Value of Partnerships
* 2015: More Vinyl, Less Carbon
* 2016: Smart Vinyl For Our Cities
* 2017: Towards Circular Economy
* 2018: Meeting Societal Needs

== Governance ==
VinylPlus‚Äôs management Board represents all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters. The Monitoring Committee offers guidance and advice, while ensuring an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the Voluntary Commitment. The Monitoring Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry. The Monitoring Committee‚Äôs stated goal is to ensure VinylPlus‚Äôs transparency, participation and accountability.

==== Recovinyl ====
The Recovinyl  programme was set up in 2003 as part of Vinyl 2010‚Äôs commitment. Its original mission was to advance waste collection and recycling schemes. When the Vinyl 2010 programme ended, it was given a dual role under the new VinylPlus initiative. While Recovinyl still encourages PVC recycling, it also aims to optimise resource efficiency by acting as an intermediary between recyclers and converters.

==== Vinyl Foundation ==== 
The Vinyl Foundation is the non-profit organisation that manages the funds from the European PVC product manufacturers, compounders and raw material traders that support VinylPlus.

'''Women in musicology''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women professors, scholars and researchers]] in [[postsecondary education]] [[musicology]] departments at [[postsecondary education]] institutions, including [[university|universities]], [[college]]s and [[Music conservatory|music conservatories]]. Traditionally, the vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She  has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

==Ethnomusicologists==
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]]  known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology ‚Äì&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ·ºîŒ∏ŒΩŒøœÇ (''ethnos'', "nation") and ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;‚Äì is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
