      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44043">The '''ATP Rankings''' are the objective merit-based method used by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) for determining the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/files/rulebook/2017/2017-atp-rulebook_chapter-ix_31jan17.pdf |title=ATP World Tour - Rulebook, Chapter IX, ATP Rankings |date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the first time on 1 March 1976. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, with the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]]s awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception of the [[ATP Finals]], from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year.

==History==
The ATP began as the men's [[trade union]] in 1972, through the combined efforts of [[Jack Kramer]], [[Cliff Drysdale]], and [[Donald Dell]], and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the [[1973 Wimbledon Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1973: The men boycott Wimbledon and shift power to the players|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/1973-men-boycott-wimbledon-and-shift-power-players/54385/|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=tennis.com|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, which up to that point was controlled by national federations and tournament directors.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rankings That Changed Tennis (Part I)|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/heritage-1973-atp-rankings-celebration-part-i|last1=Buddell|first1=James|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rankings That Changed Tennis (Part II)|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/heritage-1973-atp-rankings-celebration-part-ii|last1=Buddell|first1=James|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=23 August 2013|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, the system's first No. 1, [[Ilie Năstase]], lamented that "everyone had a number hanging over them," fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tignor|first1=Steve|title=1973: The ATP institutes computer rankings|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/1973-atp-institutes-computer-rankings/54439/|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=tennis.com|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ATP ranking criteria, which persisted through the 1980s, was based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt; Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, the ranking criteria was replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt; This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.&lt;ref name="ATP hist pt2"/&gt;

==Overview==
A player's ATP Ranking is based on the total points he accrued in the following 19 tournaments (18 if he did not qualify for the ATP Finals):
*The four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments
*The eight mandatory [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] tournaments,{{efn|In weeks where there are not four Grand Slam tournaments and eight ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments in the ranking period, the number of a player's best results from all eligible tournaments in the ranking period will be adjusted accordingly.}}
*The previous ATP Finals count until the Monday following the final regular-season ATP event of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#yeartodate |title=Rankings FAQ |publisher=Atpworldtour.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The best six results from the non-mandatory ATP World Tour 1000, all [[ATP World Tour 500]], [[ATP World Tour 250]], [[ATP Challenger Tour]], [[Futures tournament|Futures Series]] and [[Davis Cup]] tournaments played in the calendar year{{efn|At least one of these tournaments must follow the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].}}
The requirement to play in four ATP World Tour 500 events does not apply to a player who was outside the top 30 in the previous year-end ranking; however, no more than four of his results from 500 level events may be counted.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt; For a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.

Ranking points gained in a tournament are dropped 52 weeks later, with the exception of the [[ATP Finals]], from which points are dropped on the Monday following the last ATP World Tour event of the following year.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

The [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] 1000 became optional in 2009, but if a player chooses to participate in it, its result is counted and his fourth-best result in an ATP 500 event is ignored (his three best ATP 500 results remain). From 2009 until 2015, if a player did not play enough ATP 500 events and did not have an ATP 250 or Challenger appearance with a better result, the Davis Cup was counted in the 500's table.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|work=atpworldtour.com|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx#daviscup|date=|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Team Cup]] was also included before its cancellation in 2012.

For the Davis Cup, from 2009 until 2015, points were distributed for the World Group countries. Instead of having an exact drop date they were gradually updated at each phase of the competition, comparing the player's results with his results from the previous year. E.g. if a player played two matches in a semifinal but plays one the next year only that one missing match will be extracted from his points).&lt;ref name=DC /&gt;

A player who is out of competition for 30 or more days, due to a verified injury, will not receive any penalty. The ATP Finals will count as an additional 19th tournament in the ranking of its eight qualifiers at season's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=ATP World Tour |title=Rankings-FAQ |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For every Grand Slam tournament or mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament for which a player is not in the main draw, and was not (and, in the case of a Grand Slam tournament, would not have been, had he and all other players entered) a main draw direct acceptance on the original acceptance list, and never became a main draw direct acceptance, the number of his results from all other eligible tournaments in the ranking period that count for his ranking is increased by one.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Once a player is accepted in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament or ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament,{{efn|"Accepted" means a direct acceptance, a qualifier, a special exempt, or a lucky loser, or having accepted a wild card.}} his result in this tournament counts for his ranking, regardless of whether he participates. A player's withdrawal from an ATP World Tour 500 event, regardless of whether the withdrawal was on time, results in a zero point included as one of his best of four results. Further non-consecutive withdrawals results in a zero point allocation replacing the next best positive result for each additional withdrawal.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Players with multiple consecutive withdrawals who are out of competition for 30 days or longer because of injury are not subject to a ranking penalty as long as verified and approved medical forms are provided; or, a player will not have the ranking penalty imposed if he completes the Promotional Activities requirement as specified under "Repeal of Withdrawal Fines and/or Penalties" or if the on-site withdrawal procedures apply.  Players may also appeal withdrawal penalties to a Tribunal who will determine whether the penalties are affirmed or set aside.&lt;ref name="ATP rulebook"/&gt;

Between 2000 and 2012, ranking points were awarded based on results in the Summer Olympics. This was changed before the 2016 Olympics where no ranking points were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/sports/tennis/points-and-prize-money-mean-more-to-olympic-tennis-holdouts.html|title=Points and Prize Money Mean More to Olympic Tennis Holdouts|last=Rothenberg|first=Ben|date=2016-05-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these rules, a player playing and winning the mandatory 4 Grand Slams and 8 ATP Masters 1000 events, a further 5 ATP 500 events and the [[Monte-Carlo Masters]] 1000 can amass a total of 19,500 points before the ATP Finals and end the calendar year with a maximum of 21,000 points. Novak Djokovic's haul of 16,585 points in the 2015 season is the best in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Novak_Djokovic_tennis_season|title=Novak Djokovic Season of 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

==Ranking method==

Since the introduction of the ATP rankings the method used to calculate a player's ranking points has changed several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Douglas Robson|title=Happy 40th birthday, ATP computer rankings|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2013/08/19/atp-computer-rankings-turn-40/2674637/|publisher=USA Today|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon Cambers |title=40 years on, how have the ATP World Rankings developed? |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-02-15/201302151360936685683.html |website=www.wimbledon.com |publisher=[[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|AELTC]] |date=15 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231175147/http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2013-02-15/201302151360936685683.html |archivedate=2014-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Points distribution (2009 – present)===

{{ATP Entry Ranking Points Distribution 2009}}

*(ATP 1000 series) Qualifying points changes to 16 points only if the main draw is larger than 56.
*(ATP 500 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32
*(ATP 250 series) Qualifying points changes to 10 points only if the main draw is larger than 32
*Players who draw a bye in the first round in the ATP 1000 series and lose their first match in the second round are considered to have lost their first round and receive the points equivalent to first round loss. Similarly, loss in the second round of the ATP 500 series and the ATP 250 series after drawing bye in first round will result in 0 points being awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/files/rulebook/2017/2017-atp-rulebook_chapter-ix.pdf |title=ATP World Tour 2017 Rulebook |publisher=ATP World Tour }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition qualifiers and main draw entry players will then also receive the points in brackets for the rounds they reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx?#points |title=Tennis - ATP World Tour - Rankings FAQ |publisher=ATP World Tour |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2016, points were no longer awarded for [[Davis Cup]] ties,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/rankings-faq|title=Rankings {{!}} FAQ {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|newspaper=ATP World Tour|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor for the tennis tournament at the Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/news/news/ATP_Tennis/27978/itf-confirms-no-atp-points-will-be-assigned-at-olympic-games-in-rio-2016/|title=ITF confirms no ATP points will be assigned at Olympic Games in Rio 2016|newspaper=Tennis World|language=en|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] has received widespread criticism due to his support of government surveillance. President Obama had released many statements on [[mass surveillance]] as a result.

==The Patriot Act==
As a [[United States Senate|senator]], Obama condemned the [[Patriot Act]] for violating the rights of American citizens. He argued that it allowed government agents to perform extensive and in-depth searches on American citizens without a search warrant. He also argued that it was possible to secure the United States against terrorist attacks while preserving individual liberty.&lt;ref name="Obama Speeches"&gt;{{cite speech | url=http://obamaspeeches.com/041-The-PATRIOT-Act-Obama-Speech.htm| title=Senate Floor Statement - The PATRIOT Act| date=December 15, 2005| accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act, specifically provisions allowing roaming wiretaps and government searches of business records. Obama argued that the renewal was needed to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. However, the renewal was criticized by several members of Congress who argued that the provisions did not do enough to curtail excessive searches.&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43180202/ns/us_news-security/t/obama-europe-signs-patriot-act-extension/#.Uw1-ojoo7IU |title=Obama, in Europe, signs Patriot Act extension | date=2011-05-27|accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama also received criticism for his reversal on privacy protection.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/02/sen-obama-warned-about-patriot-act-abuses-president-obama-proved-him-right/|title=Sen. Obama warned about Patriot Act abuses. President Obama proved him right.| date=August 2, 2013| accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reaction to NSA mass surveillance leaks==
In June 2013, reports from a cache of [[top secret]] documents [[Leak (news)|leaked]] by ex-NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its international partners had created a global system of surveillance that was responsible for the mass collection of information on American and foreign citizens.

Obama initially defended NSA mass surveillance programs when they were first leaked. He argued that NSA surveillance was transparent and claimed that the NSA is unable and had made no attempt to monitor the phone calls and e-mails of American citizens.&lt;ref name="HuffPo-Reilly-06172013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/obama-nsa-surveillance_n_3455771.html | title=Obama Defends NSA Surveillance Program, Says It's 'Transparent' | work=Huffington Post | date=June 17, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Reilly, Molly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Snowden's admittance to leaking classified documents regarding national surveillance, Obama attempted to ignore the issue of NSA surveillance. It was speculated that Obama did this to avoid complicating the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigation into Snowden.&lt;ref name="Politico-Epstein-06112013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/edward-snowden-obama-92580.html | title=As Edward Snowden Speaks out, President Obama goes quiet | work=Politico | date=June 11, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Epstein, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Obama argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the NSA surveillance programs when they were leaked by Snowden. Obama stated that it would have been best for the American people to have never learned about the programs. He also criticized Snowden for not using existing systems within the federal government for whistleblowers. The latter statement was criticized as Snowden would have been directed to one of the committees responsible for protecting the secrecy of NSA surveillance if he had used the existing whistle-blower system.&lt;ref name="CNN-Wolf-08132013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower | title=Fact-checking Obama's claims about Snowden | work=CNN Politics | date=August 13, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Wolf, Z. Byron}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also promised to make public information about government surveillance and work with Congress to increase public confidence in the government.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse-08092013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/09/background-president-s-statement-reforms-nsa-programs | title=Background on the President’s Statement on Reforms to NSA Programs | work=The White House Office of the Press Secretary | date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 17, 2014 speech==
On January 17, 2014,  President Obama gave a public address on mass surveillance.

}} During the speech, Obama promised increased restrictions on data collection of American citizens, which would include the requirement of court approval for searches of telephone records. In addition, Obama called for increased oversight and admitted the dangers NSA surveillance posed to civil liberties.&lt;ref name="NYT-Ed-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/opinion/the-president-on-mass-surveillance.html?_r=1 | title=The President on Mass Surveillance | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=The Editorial Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
Obama's speech was criticized for being deliberately vague and not going far enough to protect civil liberties.&lt;ref name="NYT-Ed-01172014"/&gt;

Representatives for [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[Yahoo]] stated that Obama's proposed reforms represented positive progress, but that they did not ultimately do enough to protect privacy rights. A representative for [[Mozilla]] noted that mass surveillance had damaged the open Internet and caused balkanization and distrust.&lt;ref name="LATimes-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/17/business/la-fi-tn-silicon-valleys-reaction-obama-nsa-reforms-20140117 | title=Silicon Valley's reaction to Obama's NSA reforms: Not Enough | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Guynn, Jessica | location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen. [[Rand Paul]] criticized the remarks, saying: {{quote|1=While I am encouraged the President is addressing the NSA spying program because of pressure from Congress and the American people, I am disappointed in the details. The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] requires an individualized warrant based on probable cause before the government can search phone records and e-mails. President Obama’s announced solution to the NSA spying controversy is the same unconstitutional program with a new configuration.  I intend to continue the fight to restore Americans' rights through my [[Fourth Amendment Restoration Act]] and my legal challenge against the NSA. The American people should not expect the fox to guard the hen house.&lt;ref name="GlobalDispatch-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/rand-paul-on-obama-nsa-reform-the-american-people-should-not-expect-the-fox-to-guard-the-hen-house-54111/ | title=Rand Paul On Obama NSA Reform: ‘The American People Should Not Expect The Fox To Guard The Hen House’ | work=The Global Dispatch | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Herriman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dianne Feinstein]], a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that all but two or three of the members of her committee support Obama. Likewise, she criticized "privacy people" for not understanding the threat terrorists pose to the United States.&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/19/22358363-congressional-intelligence-chairmen-applaud-obama-for-backing-surveillance | title=Congressional intelligence chairmen applaud Obama for backing surveillance | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Curry, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]], the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Obama's stance on NSA surveillance. [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], another member of the House Intelligence Committee, questioned the need for the proposed reform of NSA surveillance, but admitted that they were necessary to calm down the "[[ACLU]] types".&lt;ref name="HuffPo-01252014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/nsa-obama-reaction_n_4619683.html | title=The NSA's Biggest Fans Are Happy With Obama's Speech | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=January 25, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | last1=McAuliff | first1=Michael | last2=Sledge | first2=Matt | last3=Siddiqui | first3=Sabrina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions from global leaders were limited. Great Britain and Russia, both states with extensive surveillance programs, offered no comments. [[Dilma Rousseff]], the current president of Brazil and an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance, also refused to comment. In Germany, a government spokesperson demanded greater protection for non-Americans in reaction to the speech. [[Der Spiegel]] accused the NSA of turning the internet into a weapons system.&lt;ref name="WaPo-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tepid-global-reaction-to-obamas-nsa-vow/2014/01/17/a37a43ac-7fb5-11e3-97d3-b9925ce2c57b_story.html | title=Tepid global reaction to Obama's NSA Vow | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Witte, Griff | location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] stated that Obama's pledge to reform the phone data collection is a step in the right direction, but demanded that actual laws be passed regarding this reform.&lt;ref name="TheLocal-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.de/20140119/obama-merkel-doesnt-need-to-worry-about-spying | title=Obama to Merkel: Don't worry about spying | work=[[The Local]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full point was awarded in each category where Obama fully made the promised reform. However, partial points were awarded for reforms that had not been fully completed, but where the EFF and The Day We Fight Back felt that progress as being made.&lt;ref name="TheDayWeFightBack-ObamaScorecard"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thedaywefightback.org/obama-scorecard/ | title=A Scorecard for Obama's Surveillance Reform Announcement | work=[[The Day We Fight Back]] | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | last1=Cohn | first1=Cindy | last2=Reitman | first2=Rainey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama received praise for adding independent advocates to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) courts and opposing the [[FISA Improvements Act]]. However, it was also noted that Obama had not made any progress on giving metadata storage responsibility to a third party, ending the undermining of encryption standards, increasing transparency within the NSA and protecting whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="EFFCohn"/&gt;

==Statements to the German people==
On January 18, Obama spoke to [[ZDF]] in an attempt to improve the United States relations with Germany,&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01182014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/18/22353575-obama-promises-germans-that-us-wont-wiretap-them-merkel | title=Obama Promises Germans That US Won't Wiretap Them, Merkel | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 18, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-01182014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304603704579329084011340404 | title=Obama Promises Not to Spy on Merkel | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 18, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014 | author=Thomas, Andrea | location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; which a German foreign office official said were "worse than … the low-point in 2003 during the Iraq War" due to the surveillance leaks.&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/17/22338261-us-germany-relations-hit-new-low-amid-nsa-spying-scandal-official-says | title=U.S.-Germany relations hit new low amid NSA spying scandal, official says | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 17, 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=February 22, 2014 | author=Lamarque, Kevin | location=[[Mainz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama promised that he would not let revelations about mass surveillance damage [[Germany–United States relations|German-American relations]]  and admitted that it would take a long time for the United States to regain the trust of the German people. However, he maintained that the surveillance was necessary for international security.

German reactions to the speeches given by Obama on January 17 and 18 ranged from skeptical to outright hostile. Members of the German media argued that they were hopeful that Obama would bring about needed reform. However, they also noted that his statements were vague and argued that they did not represent legitimate reform. Many German political leaders responded with outright hostility. [[Thomas Oppermann]], the chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]], demanded a no-spy treaty and stated that American surveillance constituted a crime. The German attorney general argued that there were grounds for a criminal investigation into the NSA's tapping of [[Angela Merkel]]'s cell phone.&lt;ref name="TheLocal-01202014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.de/20140120/the-usa-knows-that-for-us-spying-is-a-crime-germany-nsa-obama-snowden | title='The USA knows that for us spying is a crime' | work=[[The Local]] | date=January 20, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed overhaul of NSA phone surveillance programs==
On March 25, 2014, Obama promised to end the NSA's collection and storage of bulk phone-call data.

==Abuses and 4th Amendment Violations by the NSA and FBI==

On May 24, 2017, a declassified FISA report&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/51117/2016_Cert_FISC_Memo_Opin_Order_Apr_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama intel agency secretly conducted illegal searches on Americans for years|url=http://circa.com/politics/barack-obamas-team-secretly-disclosed-years-of-illegal-nsa-searches-spying-on-americans|accessdate=28 May 2017|agency=Circa|date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked [[Classified information#Top Secret .28TS.29|"Top Secret"]] was published, noting that the NSA routinely violated the 4th Amendment of Americans and abused intelligence tools to do so. The Obama administration self-disclosed the problems at a closed-door hearing on Oct. 26 before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, two weeks before the 2016 election. The report labeled the matter a “very serious Fourth Amendment issue," citing an "institutional lack of candor" on the part of the administration. It also criticized the NSA as having “disregard” for rules and “deficient” oversight.

More than 5 percent, or one out of every 20 searches seeking upstream Internet data on Americans inside the NSA’s so-called Section 702 database, violated the safeguards the Obama administration vowed to follow in 2011. In addition, there was a three-fold increase in NSA data searches about Americans and a rise in the unmasking of U.S. person’s identities in intelligence reports after the administration loosened privacy rules in 2011. Many of the searches involved any and all mentions of foreign targets.

Officials like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice have argued their activities were legal under the so-called minimization rule changes the Obama administration made, and that the intelligence agencies were strictly monitored to avoid abuses. The FISA court and the NSA's own internal watchdog entity disputes this claim, stating that the administration conducting such queries were "in violation of that prohibition, with much greater frequency than had been previously disclosed to the Court.”

===Sharing of data by the FBI===

The FISA report also indicated hundreds of incidences in which the FBI illegally shared raw surveillance data illegally obtained by the NSA with private entities. Earlier in May, then-FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers his agency used sensitive espionage data gathered about Americans without a warrant only when it was “lawfully collected, carefully overseen and checked.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declassified memos show FBI illegally shared spy data on Americans with private parties|url=http://circa.com/politics/declassified-memos-show-fbi-illegally-shared-spy-data-on-americans-with-private-parties|accessdate=28 May 2017|agency=Circa|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the report declared that “The Court is nonetheless concerned about the FBI’s apparent disregard of minimization rules and whether the FBI is engaging in similar disclosures of raw Section 702 information that have not been reported.”

In a declassified report from 2015,&lt;ref&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2015/o1501.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the internal watchdog had concerns as early as 2012 that the FBI was submitting "deficient” reports indicating it had a clean record complying with spy data gathered on Americans without a warrant. While Section 702 of the Foreign Surveillance Act, last updated by Congress in 2008, allowed the NSA to share with the FBI spy data collected without a warrant, the FISA report indicates FBI compliance problems began months after the updated legislation was implemented. The FBI’s very first compliance report in 2009 declared it had not found any instances in which agents accessed NSA intercepts supposedly gathered overseas about an American who in fact was on U.S. soil. The Inspector General, however, said it reviewed the same data and easily found evidence that the FBI accessed NSA data gathered on a person who likely was in the United States, making it illegal to review without a warrant.

===Reaction===

On April 28, the NSA issued a rare press release indicating it will no longer monitor all internet communications that mention a foreign intelligence target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/statements/2017-04-28-702-statement.shtml|title=NSA Statement: NSA Stops Certain Section 702 "Upstream" Activities|website=www.nsa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neema Singh Guliani, the ACLU's legislative counsel in Washington, DC stated, “I think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://circa.com/politics/barack-obamas-team-secretly-disclosed-years-of-illegal-nsa-searches-spying-on-americans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Farrell, Director of Investigations for the watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted, "This is an abuse of power and authority like we have never seen in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Chris|title=Obama’s NSA conducted illegal searches on Americans for years: Report|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qk1GH68NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The British [[DXing|DX]] Club''''' (abbreviated form "BDXC") is an association of radio hobbyists, based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It caters mainly for, though not exclusively, [[DXing|DX]]ers and [[Short Wave]] listeners. It was founded in 1974 and was originally known as the "[[Twickenham]] DX Club" (after the [[Middlesex]], [[UK]], town where it was originally based), but re-launched in 1979 as the British DX Club. The name change was made to reflect its growing national and international membership which currently stands at around 500.  To distinguish it from similar organisations in other countries, the club's abbreviated name for international use is BDXC-UK.

BDXC publishes a monthly magazine "Communication", which is registered with the [[British Library]] (ISSN 0958-2142). The main contents of a typical magazine consist of a mixture of [[DXing|DX]] "loggings", details of radio station frequencies and programmes, letters and articles of general interest on [[broadcasting]] topics. These topics include:

UK News, [[The Web|Webwatch]], DX News, [[Radio propagation|Propagation]], [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] News, Mediumwave Report, Collectors Corner ([[vintage Radio]]'s etc.), The Audio Circle, Beyond The Horizon,  [[Mediumwave]] Logbook, [[Shortwave|Tropical]] Logbook, [[High frequency|HF]] Logbook, Alternative Airwaves ([[Pirate Radio]]), and members contributions.

In 1976, the club launched a monthly audio magazine on [[cassette tape]], BDXC Audio Circle (formerly known as BDXC Tape Circle). This is now also distributed on [[Compact Disc]] and as an [[MP3]] [[downloadable]] file for subscribing members only.

The BDXC also has an [[email]] news group for club members to distribute news and DX 'catches' to subscribed members.  The Audio Circle also has its own email group.

BDXC and its members are important contributors to each  edition of the World Radio Television Handbook ([[World Radio TV Handbook|WRTH]]) an annual publication listing broadcasting times and frequencies of most of the world's national and international broadcasters. Information on other UK DX clubs is also included in WRTH.

'''''Bryum argenteum''''', the '''silvergreen bryum moss''' or '''silvery thread moss''',&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{PLANTS|id=BRAR71|taxon=Bryum argenteum|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of [[moss]] in the family [[Bryaceae]]. It is one of the most common urban mosses of inner cities and can be easily recognized without a microscope.
[[file:A living car.jpg|thumb|''B. argenteum'' growing in the cracks of a car window]]

==Description==
The species is silvery-green or whitish-green colored when dry. This is because the broadly ovate shaped single leaflets in the tip do not form [[chlorophyll]]. The costa extends beyond the middle of the leaf. In damp, undisturbed locations, the branches may also form a more horizontal growth habit. The upper cells of the leaf surface are elongated rhomboid shaped. The capsule of the sporophyte is short cylindrical, appears broader at the base and is dark red to black colored.&lt;ref name=il&gt;http://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/mosses/plants/silver_moss.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a high ability to tolerate drought and pollution of urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://pza.sanbi.org/bryum-argenteum&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. argenteum'' is considered a desiccation tolerant species that can withstand total drying. While it is a common characteristic in mosses, ''B. argenteum'' was one of the first [[bryophytes]] experimentally determined to be desiccation tolerant.&lt;ref name=gao2017&gt;Gao B, Li X, Zhang D, et al. Desiccation tolerance in bryophytes: The dehydration and rehydration transcriptomes in the desiccation-tolerant bryophyte Bryum argenteum. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1):7571. Published 2017 Aug 8. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-07297-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
An adaptable plant, it has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] and is found in Europe, North America, the deserts of [[Australia]] and in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=AOLA&gt;{{cite web |title=Bryum argenteum|work=Atlas of Living Australia|url=https://bie.ala.org.au/species/http://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/ausmoss/10062136|accessdate= October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web|title=The cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum in Antarctica: recent colonisation or in situ survival?|author=S. Pisa, E. M. Biersma, P. Convey, J. Patiño, A. Vanderpoorten, O Werner, R. M. Ros|work=Springer Link - Polar Biology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-014-1537-3|accessdate=October 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612122250/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00300-014-1537-3|archive-date=2018-06-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It thrives in areas of high anthropogenic activity, growing on rocks, in gaps of paving stones, on asphalt, and on roadsides. It grows especially well in inner cities or in industrial areas. Being a nitrogen loving species, it is also found on nitrophilic soils in urban areas.  It is found growing among lawns as well as in other moss communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/bbs/activities/mosses/Bryum%20argenteum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The species is often spread by vegetative fragments clinging to the shoes of people and the feet or hooves of animals.&lt;ref name=il/&gt;
Another method of spread is in the production and sale of [[liners]]. Liners infested with ''B. argentem'', often in association with ''[[Marchantia polymorpha]]'', are commonly grown in one region of the country, transported to another region to continue growth, and are shipped to a retail location before being planted. Plants have the potential to pick up or disperse these species at each point of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/13/1/35.full.pdf|title=Controlling Liverwort and Moss Now and in the Future| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common heritage of mankind''' (also termed the '''common heritage of humanity''', '''common heritage of humankind''' or '''common heritage principle''') is a principle of [[international law]] which holds that defined territorial areas and elements of humanity's common heritage (cultural and natural) should be held in trust for future generations and be protected from exploitation by individual [[nation states]] or [[corporations]].

==Origins==
In his essay ''Toward Perpetual Peace'', [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy-Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p 329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Common Heritage of Mankind'', however, was first mentioned in the preamble to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Hague 14 May 1954 http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html accessed 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of 'Mankind' is also mentioned in outer space treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389, 961 U.N.T.S. 187 (entered into force Sept. 1, 1972) and the 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695, 1023 U.N.T.S. 15 (entered into force Sept. 15, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Mankind' as a subject in international law also appears in the Preamble of the [[United Nations Charter]], the Preamble of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] (1949) and the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (1968).&lt;ref name=Gyula04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gyula Gál |title=Some Remarks to General Clauses of Treaty Space Law |journal=Miskolc Journal of International Law (Miskolci Nemzetközi Jogi Közlemények) |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law of the Sea Treaty ==
[[File:Oceans.png|150px|left|thumb|Map of the world's oceans]]
In 1970, [[United Nations General Assembly]] Resolution 2749, the ''Declaration of Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor'', was adopted by 108 nation states and stated that the deep seabed should be preserved for peaceful purposes and is the "Common Heritage of Mankind."&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Res. 2749 (XXV), ¶ 1, U.N. Doc. A/RES/25/2749 (Dec. 12, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Common Heritage of Mankind concept was stated to relate to "the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction" under Article 136 of the [[United Nations]] [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (UNCLOS).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 1, para. 1, Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.N.T.S. 397 [UNCLOS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Payoyo argues that the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in Part XI of the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] should favour developing states (who were the voice of [[conscience]] in establishing it), and not merely in some transient 'affirmative action' manner.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p 326.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims, however, that the 1994 ''Implementation Agreement'' facilitated control by industrialised countries of the [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA), allowing access by the private sector to the deep [[sea bed]] and inhibiting constructive dialogue on sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p458.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core conceptual components==
Maltese Ambassador [[Arvid Pardo]], one of the founders of the ''common heritage of humanity'' concept under international law, has claimed that it challenges the "structural relationship between rich and poor countries" and amounts to a "revolution not merely in the law of the sea, but also in international relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pardo A |title=Ocean, Space and Mankind |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=6 |pages=559–69 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/01436598408419785 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main architects of the principle under international space law has claimed that it is "the most important legal principle achieved by man throughout thousands of years during which law has existed as the regulating element of social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Cocca A. Introduction to the Study of the Legal Framework for Economic Activity in Space. Cordoba, 1982. p159 cited in {{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 250 fn11 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This praise relates to the fact that [[international law]] in the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle is seeking to protect, respect and fulfill the interests of human beings independently of any politically motivated [[sovereign state]]; the concept covering all humans wherever they are living, as well as future generations.&lt;ref name=Gyula04/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Common Heritage of Mankind: A Bibliography of Legal Writing|date=2013|publisher=Fondation de Malte|location=Malta|isbn=978-1-291-57725-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Common-Heritage-Mankind-Bibliography-Writing/dp/1291577254/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392109201&amp;sr=1-4|author2=Stroud, Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frakes has identified five core components of the Common Heritage of Humanity concept.&lt;ref name=Frakes03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frakes, Jennifer |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? |journal=Wisconsin International Law Journal |volume=21 |pages=409 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there can be no private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate shared management. Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of [[global public good]]. Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a "[[tragedy of the commons]]" scenario.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; Academic claims have been made that where the principle requires the establishment of an international resource management regime, prior to establishment of such a regime a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on resource exploitation should be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Narayana RK |title=Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=21 |pages=275 |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sehgal N |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=26 |issue= |pages=112 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a position does not appear to have been supported by most states during the respective drafting negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 259 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Destroyed Statue, July 17, 2005 at 15-53.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bamian Valley]] - UNESCO World Heritage listed site in [[Afghanistan]], showing destroyed [[Buddha]] statue.]]
A similar principle of international law holds that the world's [[cultural heritage|cultural]] and natural heritage (as nominated for listing by nation states) must be protected by states parties to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. World Heritage Convention. http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/ (accessed 27 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study in the use of these provisions was provided by the [[Franklin Dam]] [[non-violent protest]] campaign against the construction of a dam of [[Australia]]'s last wild river; they being held by the [[Australian High Court]] to provide a valid basis for legislation protecting the [[Franklin River]]. Justice Lionel Murphy wrote in that case (''[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]'') about the Common Heritage of Humanity principle: "The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war&amp;nbsp;... [t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]] (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential applications==

It was argued at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] and has been advocated by academics that global communication between individuals over the [[internet]] should be regarded as part of the Common Heritage of Mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henrik Spang-hanssen |title=Public International Computer Network Law Issues |publisher=Djoef Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=87-574-1486-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, it has been argued that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, [[laws]] and [[government]] [[policies]] should create the social preconditions whereby [[conscience]], properly understood, can be delinked from (often destructive) [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, and associated with a [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the Common Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffiths, Bede |title=A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith |publisher=Harpercollins/STL |year=1992 |page=276 |isbn=0-00-627636-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such thinking with associated implications about how a [[sustainable]] world in the future should be [[regulated]] is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson. Passages About the Earth: An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture. Rider and Co. London. 1974. Ch 7. 'To Findhorn and Lindisfarne' pp 150–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial countries have proposed that the [[geostationary orbit]] over the [[high seas]] should be declared the ''common heritage of mankind''.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries''. Bagota 3 Dec 1976. ITU Doc. WARC-BS (17 Jan 1977) 81-E. Reproduced: Journal of Space Law 1978; 6:193.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that a [[World government]] would manage common heritage areas according to principles of ''planetary democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, Alexander. Why a World State is Inevitable. European Journal of International Relations. 2003; 9 (4): 491–542&lt;/ref&gt; The international law concept of common heritage of humanity has also been linked with [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, Luis. Political Theory of Global Justice: A Cosmopolitan Case for the World State. London, Routledge. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Common heritage of humanity as a concept of international law is supported by many of the principles in the [[Earth Charter]] civil society Initiative&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html accessed 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies about the principle==
[[File:NGC 6302 Hubble 2009.full.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[NGC 6302]] [[nebula]]. Militarization of [[Outer Space]] would be contrary to ''common heritage of humanity'' principles.]]Kemal Baslar has stated that the Common Heritage of Mankind principle "is a philosophical idea that questions the regimes of globally important resources regardless of their situation, and requires major changes in the world to apply its provisions. In other words, the application and enforcement of the common heritage of mankind require a critical reexamination of many well-established principles and doctrines of classical [[international law]], such as acquisition of territory, consent-based sources of international law, [[sovereignty]], [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[resource allocation]] and international personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kemal Baslar |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law |series=Developments in International Law |volume=30 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location=Dordrecht |year=1997 |isbn=90-411-0505-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to the [[tragedy of the commons]] dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf here] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott James Shackelford. 2008. "The Tragedy of the Common Heritage of Mankind"
Available at: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1407332 accessed 30 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of [[conscience]] in achieving justice and equality in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Axelrod, Robert M. |title=The evolution of cooperation |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-02121-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting [[economic rationalism]] on such social and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G. N. (1993). [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217063416/http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00002203/01/HARDIN.pdf Hardin's Myth of the Commons: The Tragedy of Conceptual Confusions]. Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many that point out that as what we are seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on [[Malthusian]] ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment.

The extent to which the Common Heritage of Mankind principle does or should control the activities of private [[multinational corporations]] as well as [[nation states]], particularly with regard to [[mining]] activities, remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholson G |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind and Mining: An Analysis of the Law as to the High Seas, Outer Space, the Antarctic, and World Heritage |journal=New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law |volume=6 |pages=177 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underdeveloped nations]] often see the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyner CC |title=Legal Implications of the Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind |journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly |volume=35 |pages=190 |year=1986 |doi=10.1093/iclqaj/35.1.190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vereshchetin VS, Kamenetskaya EP |title=On the Way to a World Space Organization |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law  |volume=12 |pages=337 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

[[File:Continental models-Australia.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Animated, colour-coded map showing the various continents and regions. [[Boundaries between the continents of Earth|Depending on the convention and model]], some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, [[Eurasia]] is most often subdivided into [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] (red shades), while [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] are sometimes recognised as [[Americas|one American continent]] (green shades).]]

A '''continent''' is one of several very large [[Land#Land mass|landmasses]] of the [[world]]. Generally identified by [[convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in area to smallest, they are: [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Antarctica]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/|title=Continents: What is a Continent?|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|archivedate=2009-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629180448/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/}} "Most people recognize seven continents—Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, from largest to smallest—although sometimes Asia and Europe are considered a single continent, Eurasia."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geology|Geologically]], the continents largely correspond to areas of [[continental crust]] that are found on the [[plate tectonics|continental plates]]. However, some areas of continental crust are [[submerged continent|regions covered with water]] not usually included in the list of continents.  [[Zealandia]] is one such area (see [[#Submerged continents|submerged continents]] below).

Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the [[Pacific Ocean]] are grouped together with the [[Australia (continent)|continent of Australia]] to form a geopolitical region called ''[[Oceania]]''.

== Definitions and application ==
[[File:Dymaxion map unfolded-no-ocean.png|thumb|right|A [[Dymaxion map]] shows land masses with minimal shape distortion.]]

By convention, "continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water."{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=21}}  Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion "large" leads to arbitrary classification: [[Greenland]], with a surface area of {{convert|2166086|sqkm}} is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at {{convert|7617930|sqkm}} is deemed the smallest continent.

[[Earth]]'s major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous [[World Ocean]], which is divided into a number of principal [[ocean]]ic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]".

In this sense the term ''[[continental Europe]]'' (sometimes referred to in Britain as "the Continent") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding [[island]]s such as [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Malta]] and [[Iceland]], and the term ''continent of Australia'' may refer to the [[Australia (continent)|mainland of Australia]], excluding [[Tasmania]] and [[New Guinea]]. Similarly, the ''[[contiguous United States|continental United States]]'' refers to the 48 contiguous states and the [[District of Columbia]] in central North America and may include [[Alaska]] in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by [[Canada]]), while excluding [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]] in the oceans.

From the perspective of [[geology]] or [[physical geography]], ''continent'' may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the [[continental shelf]])&lt;ref&gt;"continent [2, n] 6" (1996) ''[[Webster's Dictionary#Webster's Third New International|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]''. [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]]. "a large segment of the earth's outer shell including a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] continent and the adjacent continental shelf"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[island]]s on the shelf ([[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]), as they are structurally part of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monkhouse |first=F. J. |author2=John Small |title=A Dictionary of the Natural Environment |year=1978 |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |id= |pages= 67–68 |quote=structurally it includes shallowly submerged adjacent areas (continental shelf) and neighbouring islands }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this perspective, the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.&lt;ref name=Ollier&gt;[[Cliff Ollier|Ollier, Cliff D.]] (1996). Planet Earth. In Ian Douglas (Ed.), ''Companion Encyclopedia of Geography: The Environment and Humankind''. London: Routledge, p. 30. "Ocean waters extend onto continental [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] at continental shelves, and the true edges of the continents are the steeper continental slopes. The actual shorelines are rather accidental, depending on the height of sea-level on the sloping shelves."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.

[[File:Island nations.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of [[island country|island countries]]: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.]]

As a [[social constructionism|cultural construct]], the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]] and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and [[Madagascar]] part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the [[Australian Plate|Australian continental plate]] with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called [[Oceania]]. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |page=40 |ps=: "The joining of Australia with various Pacific islands to form the quasi continent of Oceania ... "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation ===
{{Main|Boundaries between the continents of Earth}}
{{See also|List of transcontinental countries}}

The ideal criterion that each continent is a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by the ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as "''more or less'' discrete masses of land".{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=35}} Asia and Africa are joined by the [[Isthmus of Suez]], and North and South America by the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Panama Canal]], which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these [[isthmus]]es are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.

North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the [[Americas]]. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |loc=Chapter 1 |ps=: "While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II. [...] By the 1950s, however, virtually all American geographers had come to insist that the visually distinct landmasses of North and South America deserved separate designations."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.

The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of {{convert|10180000|sqkm}}, while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of [[Eurocentrism]]: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, [[China]] and [[India]] are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...]."{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=? }} However, for historical and cultural reasons,{{which|date=May 2017}} the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as [[Afro-Eurasia]]. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.

When sea levels were lower during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming [[land bridge]]s. At those times [[Australia (continent)|Australia–New Guinea]] was a single, continuous continent. Likewise, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]]. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.

== Other divisions ==

=== Supercontinents ===
Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term ''continent'' varies. [[Supercontinent]]s, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one [[craton]] or continental core. These have included [[Laurasia]], [[Gondwana]], [[Vaalbara]], [[Kenorland]], [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]], [[Rodinia]], and [[Pangaea]].

=== Subcontinents ===
Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{citation |last=Baldwin |first=James A. |chapter=Continents |editor=R. W. McColl |title=Encyclopedia of World Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&amp;pg=PA215 |date=14 May 2014 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-7229-3 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Cone]] of South America and [[Alaska|Alaskan peninsula]] of North America are other examples.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"/&gt;

In many of these cases, the "subcontinents" concerned are on different [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.&lt;ref name="Molnar2015"&gt;{{citation|last=Molnar|first=Peter|title=Plate Tectonics: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbuUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|date=26 March 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-104396-3}}

=== Submerged continents ===
Some areas of [[continental crust]] are largely covered by the sea and may be considered [[submerged continent]]s. Notable examples are [[Zealandia]], emerging from the sea primarily in [[New Zealand]] and [[New Caledonia]], and the almost completely submerged [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

=== Microcontinents ===
Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered [[continental fragment|microcontinents]].

=== Botanical continents ===
[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|"Botanical continents" defined by the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]].]]

"Continents" may be defined differently for specific purposes. The [[Biodiversity Information Standards]] organization has developed the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]], used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine "botanical continents". Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brummitt |first=R.K. |year=2001 |title=World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions: Edition 2 |publisher=International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases For Plant Sciences (TDWG) |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/tdwg/TDWG_geo2.pdf |accessdate = 2006-11-27 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early concepts of the Old World continents ===
The term "continent" translates Greek {{lang|grc|ἤπειρος}}, properly   "landmass, terra firma", the proper name of [[Epirus]] and later especially used of Asia (i.e. [[Asia Minor]]),&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (1940), s.v. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=h)/peiros ἤπειρος]. The English noun was introduced in the mid-16th century, shortened from ''continent land'' (15th century), adapted from Latin ''terra continens'' "continuous landmass".&lt;/ref&gt;
The first distinction between continents was made by [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]] strait, the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]] strait and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=Toynbee&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee, Arnold J.]] (1954). ''A Study of History''. London: Oxford University Press, v. 8, pp. 711–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and "...&amp;nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ..."&lt;ref name=Toynbee/&gt;

Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called ''Libya'') should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |pp=21–22}} The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the [[Rioni River]] (known then as the ''Phasis'') in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and along the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] (known then as the ''Tanais'') in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the [[Nile]] River.

"I cannot conceive why three names ... should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality one,"&lt;/ref&gt; a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.

[[Eratosthenes]], in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them "islands". Others divided the continents by [[isthmus]]es, calling the continents "peninsulas". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the [[Caspian Sea]], and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the [[Red Sea]] and the mouth of [[Lake Bardawil]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]].

Through the Roman period and the [[Middle Ages]], a few writers took the [[Isthmus of Suez]] as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon){{citation needed|date=October 2014}}. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on [[T and O map]]s, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, "the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and [[Libya]]] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away".&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Farley Brewer (1884).

=== European arrival in the Americas ===
[[Christopher Columbus]] sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the [[Americas]]. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.

In 1501, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Gonçalo Coelho]] attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]], passing through [[Fernando de Noronha]]. After reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed a long way further south along the coast of [[South America]], confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.&lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year= 1961 | pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called ''Mundus Novus'' ("New World"), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,&lt;ref name=formisano1&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio, pp. xx–xxi. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel1&gt;Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). ''Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 77–79. {{ISBN|0-7658-0987-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who penned the words, ''Mundus Novus'' credited Vespucci with saying, "I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa",&lt;ref name=formisano2&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio, p. 45. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.

Within a few years, the name "New World" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed [[North America]] connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel1/&gt;

[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|''Universalis Cosmographia'', Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia]]

In 1507 [[Martin Waldseemüller]] published a world map, ''[[Waldseemüller map|Universalis Cosmographia]]'', which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named "America" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel2&gt;Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). ''Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 80–82. {{ISBN|0-7658-0987-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the map, the word "America" was placed on part of South America.

=== The word ''continent'' ===
From the 16th century the English noun ''continent'' was derived from the term ''continent land'', meaning continuous or connected land&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"continent n." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; and translated from the Latin ''terra continens''.&lt;ref&gt;"continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2006) ''The [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The noun was used to mean "a connected or continuous tract of land" or [[mainland]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the ''continents'' (or mainlands) of [[Isle of Man]], [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]] and in 1745 to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The word ''continent'' was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three "parts" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as ''continent'' was used.{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=29}}

While ''continent'' was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, [[Peter Heylin]] wrote in his ''Cosmographie'' that "A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa." In 1727, [[Ephraim Chambers]] wrote in his ''Cyclopædia,'' "The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the [[Old World|old]] and the [[New World|new]]." And in his 1752 atlas, [[Emanuel Bowen]] defined a continent as "a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another."&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Emanuel. (1752). ''A Complete Atlas, or Distinct View of the Known World''. London, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as "parts" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

=== Beyond four continents ===
From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lewis30&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans discovered [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).&lt;ref name=lewis30/&gt; In 1813, [[Samuel Butler (schoolmaster)|Samuel Butler]] wrote of Australia as "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent" and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was just as equivocal some decades later.&lt;ref&gt;"continent n. 5. a." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]]. "the great island of Australia is sometimes reckoned as another [continent]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antarctica]] was sighted in 1820 during the [[First Russian Antarctic Expedition]] and described as a continent by [[Charles Wilkes]] on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great "Antarctic" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-20743-2 |chapter= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.&lt;ref name=lewis32&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |id={{ISBN|0-520-20742-4}}, {{ISBN|0-520-20743-2}} |page=32 |chapter= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.&lt;ref name=lewis32/&gt; With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to [[Latin America]]ns, who saw their region spanning an {{lang|es|América}} as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed ''[[Eurasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Some geographers list only six continents, combining Europe and Asia into Eurasia. In parts of the world, students learn that there are just five continents: Eurasia, Australia, Africa, Antarctica, and the Americas.''{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/faq/geography.html#continents|title=How many continents are there?|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.

== Geology ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
{{further|Continental crust|Plate tectonics}}
Geologists use the term ''continent'' in a different manner from geographers. In geology a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous rock]], largely of [[granite|granitic]] composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable [[Precambrian]] "shield", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a [[craton]]. The craton itself is an [[accretion (geology)|accretionary]] complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of [[subduction]], [[continental collision]] and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger minimally deformed [[sedimentary rock]] covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or [[river delta|deltaic]] [[sediment]]s. Beyond the margin, there is either a [[continental shelf]] and drop off to the [[basalt]]ic [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]] or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are "high and dry"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|last = Kominz|first = Michelle A.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2001|isbn = |location = San Diego|pages = 2609|chapter = Sea level variations over geologic time|url = http://www.curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter10/Ency_Oceans/Sea_Level_Variations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans]]

Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal "rafts" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. [[East European craton]] and [[Indian craton]]). Younger mobile belts (such as the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Himalayas]]) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.

There are many [[Continental fragment|microcontinents, or continental fragments]], that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of [[Gondwana]] or other ancient cratonic continents: [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], which includes [[Geography of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]; [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]]; the northern [[Mascarene Plateau]], which includes the [[Seychelles]]. Other islands, such as several in the [[Caribbean Sea]], are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The [[Kerguelen Plateau]], for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |title=UT Austin scientist plays major rule in study of underwater "micro-continent" |publisher=Utexas.edu |accessdate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103165732/http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |archivedate= 3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/353277.stm |title=Sci/Tech &amp;#124; 'Lost continent' discovered |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-05-27 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas volcanic [[Geography of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]] are not. The [[British Isles]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Borneo]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] are margins of the [[Laurasia]]n continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.

[[Plate tectonics]] offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified [[Eurasian Plate]], which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent [[Himalaya]] mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting [[isthmus]] being largely the result of [[volcano|volcanism]] from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the [[Canadian Shield]]), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian landmass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions ("continental rocks," "plate boundaries") are used as appropriate.

The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years ago and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Guochun |last2=Cawood |first2=Peter A. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Sun |first4=M. |date=November 2002 |title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |pages=125–162 |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825202000739 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |author2=Sun, M. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Li, S.Z.  |date=November 2004 |title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |pages=91–123 |accessdate=2013-01-08 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825204000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supercontinent [[Rodinia]] is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago.

'''Continental crustal fragments''', partially synonymous with '''microcontinents''',&lt;ref&gt;"Microcontinent" was initially the broader term, because it was defined morphologically rather than genetically (in term or genesis or origin). Scrutton, Roger A. (1976) "Microcontinents and Their Significance" pp. 177–189 ''In'' Drake, Charles L. (1976) (editor) ''Geodynamics: Progress and Prospects'' American Geophysical Union, Washington, D.C., {{ISBN|978-0-87590-203-6}}.  But, using Scrutton's definition, "microcontinent" is a narrower term, excluding aseismic ridges of continental material, such as the [[Lomonosov Ridge]] and the [[Jan Mayen Microcontinent|Jan Mayen Ridge]], which could still be considered "continental fragments".&lt;/ref&gt; are fragments of [[continent]]s that have been broken off from main continental masses forming distinct islands, often several hundred kilometers from their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |pages=41–43|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; All continents are fragments; {{citation needed span|text=the terms "continental fragment" and "microcontinent" are usually restricted to those smaller than [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]|date=February 2017}}, due to Australia being the smallest continent. They are not known to contain a [[craton]] or fragment of a craton. Continental fragments include some [[seamount]]s and underwater plateaus.

Some microcontinents are fragments of [[Gondwana]] or other ancient cratonic continents: these include [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]]; the northern [[Mascarene Plateau]], which includes the [[Seychelles]]; the island of [[Timor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |pages=27–29|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Other islands, such as several in the [[Caribbean Sea]], are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear dividing line between islands and microcontinents under such a definition. The [[Kerguelen Plateau]] is a [[large igneous province]] formed by a volcanic [[hot spot (geology)|hot spot]]; however, it was associated with the breakup of Gondwana and was for a time above water, so it is considered a microcontinent, though not a continental fragment.&lt;ref name="UT"&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html UT Austin scientist plays major rule in study of underwater "micro-continent".] Retrieved on 2007-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/353277.stm Sci/Tech 'Lost continent' discovered] Retrieved on 2007-07-03&lt;/ref&gt; Other hotspot islands such as [[Geography of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]] are considered neither microcontinents nor continental fragments. Not all islands can be considered microcontinents: the [[British Isles]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Borneo]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for example, are each within the continental shelf of an adjacent continent, separated from the mainland by inland seas flooding its margins.

Several islands in the eastern [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] are considered continental fragments, although this designation is controversial. These include [[Sumba]], [[Timor]] ([[Nusa Tenggara]]), [[Banggai Regency|Banggai]]-[[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]] Islands ([[Sulawesi]]), [[Obi Islands|Obi]], southern [[Bacan]], and the [[Buru]]-[[Seram]]-[[Ambon Island|Ambon]] complex ([[Maluku islands|Maluku]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=41|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imf-advanced-un-least-developed-2008.svg|thumb|300px|Developed countries are shown in blue (according to the [[International Monetary Fund]], as of 2008)]]
In [[world systems theory]], the '''core countries''' are the [[industrialized]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries on which [[periphery countries]] and [[semi-periphery countries]] depend. Core countries control and benefit from the global market. They are usually recognized as wealthy nations with a wide variety of resources and are in a favorable location compared to other states. They have strong state institutions, a powerful military and powerful global political alliances.

Core countries do not always stay core permanently. Throughout history, core nations have been changing and new ones have been added to the core list. The most influential countries in the past have been what would be considered core. These were the [[Asia]]n, [[India]]n and [[Middle Eastern]] empires in the ages up to the 16th century, prominently India and [[China]] were the richest regions in the world until the 15th century, when the [[Europe]]an powers took the lead, although the major Asian powers such as China were still very influential in the region. Europe remained ahead of the pack until the 20th century, when the two [[World Wars]] turned disastrous for the European economies. It is then that the victorious [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]], up to late 1980s, became the two [[hegemons]], creating a bipolar [[New world order (politics)|world order]].
The heart of civilisation consists of [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]] and [[Japan]]. The population of the core is by far the wealthiest and best educated on the planet.

== Definition ==
Core countries control and profit the most from the world system, and thus they are the "core" of the world system. These countries possess the ability to exercise control over other countries or groups of countries with several kinds of power such as military, economic, and political power.

The [[United States]], [[Canada]], the countries of the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] are examples of present core countries that have the most power in the world economic system.&lt;ref name=essentials&gt;Margaret L.

Before the 13th century, many empires were considered to be "core" nations, such as the Persian, Indian, and Roman empires, the Muslim Caliphates, the Chinese and Egyptian dynasties, the various Mesopotamian kingdoms, and so on.

In Asia, the Chinese Empire was considered the middle kingdom and controlled the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sLxL3FkqCpIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=PbWzWwh343&amp;dq=chinese%20empire&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  Steele, P.

[[India]] until the 13th century, often referred to as [[Greater India]], extended its religious, cultural, and trading influence on vast Asian regions from [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] to [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTw-nwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=India and Malaysia: Intertwined Strands|first=Veena|last=Sikri|date=16 December 2017|publisher=Manohar Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Buddhism and Hinduism, two of the most followed religions in Asia and the World as a whole, having originated there, India's cultural impact spread throughout Asia. A notable example is China, where Buddhism became the prominent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hftlEEV1J1oC|title=Buddhism in Chinese History|first=Arthur F.|last=Wright|date=16 December 2017|publisher=Stanford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanskrit]] was a prominent scholarly language in all the southeastern kingdoms until the 10th century C.E.. [[Angkor Vat]] of [[Cambodia]], the largest temple complex in the world, was originally a Hindu temple and later transformed into a Buddhist monastery.

===13th–15th century===
[[File:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|left|alt=Expansion Of The Mongol Empire.|Expansion of the [[Mongol Empire]]]]

====Mongol Empire====
[[Pax Mongolica]] is a particularly important period which started in 1206 and ended, according to contradicting sources, between late 14th and early 15th centuries. The trade during this period took on a truly multi-continental dimension, efficient and safe trade routes were established, and many of the modern rules of trade were emerging. The [[Mongol Empire]] was the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world. It stretched from as far east as China all the way to Europe, taking up large parts of Central Asia, [[Middle East]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZy5tDjaUkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=mongolian+empire&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fKkJTKvxC8X_lgewqZ3cDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false O'Brien, P.K. ''Atlas of World History'' p.98]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|see list of territories]])]]
Many trade routes went through the Mongol Empire territory, even though they were not the easiest ones to travel, due to the rough Asian terrain. Yet, they attracted many merchants, because these routes were relatively cheap and safe to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Abu—Lughod, J.L. ''Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250—1350'' p.154 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rYlgGU2SLiQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=before%20european%20hegemony&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mongols]] controlled their territories through military force and taxation. In many regions of the Mongol territory, Mongol rule is remembered as brutal and destructive. Yet, some argue that many economic and cultural improvements were made during the Mongol Empire's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/paxmongolica.shtml|title=Pax Mongolica|first=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.|last=Lee|website=www.silk-road.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman Empire====
The [[Ottoman Empire]], which emerged in 1299, quickly became a power to be reckoned with. By 1450, the Ottoman Empire took up the connecting territory between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Mediterranean seas]]. Despite lasting three times longer than the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire never came to be anywhere near as expansive.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, C. ''Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300—1923'' p.3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=maT_XL3mgxwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ottoman%20empire&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th–18th century===
Prior to the 16th century, [[feudalism]] took over Western European society and pushed Western Europe on a road to capitalist development. Population and commerce grew rapidly within the feudal system during the years of 1150–1300. Through the years 1300–1450, an economic downfall came about.  The feudalism growth had come to an end.&lt;ref name=modernhistory&gt;Paul Halsall.
[http://teacher2.smithtown.k12.ny.us/jferrante/APWorld10/Handouts/wallerstein%20overview.pdf Modern History Sourcebook: Wallerstein on World Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308021951/http://teacher2.smithtown.k12.ny.us/jferrante/APWorld10/Handouts/wallerstein%20overview.pdf |date=2012-03-08 }}.Aug 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein|Wallerstein]], "the feudal crisis was most likely brought on by the involvement of the three following factors below:
# [[Agricultural production]] fell or remained stagnant. This meant that the burden of peasant producers increased as the ruling class expanded.
# The economic cycle of the feudal economy had reached its optimum level; afterward, the economy began to shrink. [[File:Western Europe 1700.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=A Map of Western Europe|A map of Western Europe]]
# A shift of [[Climatological|climatological conditions]] decreased agricultural productivity and contributed to an increase in epidemics within the population."&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

The feudal crisis lead to the development of the world economic system. The world economic system came about during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The most dominant of Northwestern Europe were [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] (see map of Western Europe on the right). These countries took on the definition of a core country. They developed a strong central government, bureaucracies, and grew their military power. These countries were then able to control the international commerce and create a profit for themselves. All of western Europe attempted bureaucratization, [[Homogeneity|homogenization]] of the local population, development of a stronger military, and involvement of the country in a vast number of different economic activities.  After these attempts to gain the "core" status, north-western European states locked in their positions as core states by 1640.  England dominated the pack, as [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] fell to semi-peripheral status.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

One factor that helped the core countries dominate over the other countries is long-distance trade with the Americas and the East.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} This trade produced profits of 200–300%. In order to enter this trade market, countries needed a great amount of capital and state help.  The smaller countries could not make this happen, and this widened the gap between the "core" and "semi-periphery" countries. These core positions held strong up and throughout the 18th century, even as the core regions started to produce a mixture of agricultural and industrial goods. At the beginning of 1700, manufacture of goods in industrial productions started to take off. Industrial production soon took over the agricultural production up to the year 1900.&lt;ref name=modernhistory/&gt;

===18th–early 19th century===
As nations continued to grow technologically, especially through printing journals and newspapers, communication was more widespread. Thus, the global society was united through this force.&lt;ref&gt;Rosow, Stephen J. "Nature, Need, and the Human World; "Commercial Society" and the Construction of the World Economy." ''The Global Economy as Political Space''. p. 17. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RZPJK58IQ7IC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=economy+in+18th+century&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=economy%20in%2018th%20century&amp;f=false Link to Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to assure a good life for their citizens, countries needed to rely on trade and on [[Technological progress|technological advancements]], which ultimately determined how well in the world a country stood.&lt;ref&gt;Rosow, Stephen J. "Nature, Need, and the Human World; "Commercial Society" and the Construction of the World Economy." ''The Global Economy as Political Space''. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping in mind the interactions of nations in this period, John W. Cell notes in his essay entitled "Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850", that war and trade were somewhat dependent on each other. Nations had to defend their ships while also establishing territories elsewhere to ensure successful trade for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 448 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false Link to Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 17th century, the "foundations of the modern world system had been laid."&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 445  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false Link to google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise and eventual European hegemony====
At the beginning of the 18th century, Europe had not yet dominated in the world economy on account of the fact that its military did not match that of Asia or of the Middle East. However, through organizing its economics and improving technology in industry, European countries took the lead as the most powerful nations in the late 18th century and remained in this position until late in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cell_p445"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cell |first=John W. |title=Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850. |work=Asia in World History: Essays |page='''445''' |publisher=Some text available on Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Asia was making and distributing goods that were valued by other areas, namely [[cotton]], [[silk]] and [[tea]]. Europe on the other hand, was not producing products of interest to the other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cell |first=John W. |title=Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850. |work=Asia in World History: Essays |page='''447''' |publisher=Some text available on Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ1UHX-L8jgC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=the+world+in+1700&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20world%20in%201700&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, although Europe was wealthy, this dynamic shows that there may be a reversal of power because it was consistently expanding money, yet hardly bringing in currency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} America's crops were not initially appealing to Europeans. Tobacco's demand had to be advertised, and eventually Europe became interested in this particular plant. In time, there was rather regular [[wikt:transatlantic|trans-Atlantic]] trade between the Americas and Europe for such crops as tobacco, cotton, and also goods available in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Cell_p445"/&gt;

====Slave trade====
The 18th century was profoundly marked by the [[slave trade]]. [[History of slavery|Slavery was present]] in [[civilization]]s on all continents throughout post-hunter-gatherer history.  The importation of slaves from the Old World started on continental [[North America]] in August 1619 as a form of [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]], and continued in the next centuries. Slavery also occurred in [[Africa]] previous to Europeans capitalizing on selling slaves. Africans were sometimes hired to collect others off the coast, and bring them back to European ships.&lt;ref&gt;Cell, John W. " Europe and the World in an Expanding World Economy, 1700—1850." ''Asia in World History: Essays''. p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this trade, the dependent nations remained dependent as their [[populations]] were suffering from the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Inikori"&gt;Inikori, J.E. "Africa in World History: the Export Slave Trade From Africa and the Emergence of the Altlantic Economic Order." ''General History of Africa V; Africa from the sixteenth to eighteenth century.'' p.92. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_dj9RRrvYjkC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=eighteenth+century+core+countries&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Link to Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

This trade of humans was incredibly profitable for the Europeans, perpetuating their success and "rule" of the seas. Immediately following the early 19th century, the southern U.S. population consisted of 37.5% slaves.&lt;ref name="Inikori"/&gt;

===Early 19th century–present===
[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|300px|Map showing the [[British Empire]] in 1921]]
At the beginning of the 19th century, Europe still dominated as the core region of the world. [[France]] attempted to obtain European hegemony under the rule of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;Abernethy, David (2000).

==Sociological theory==
The [[World Systems Theory]] argues that a nation's future is decided by their stance in the global economy. A global capitalistic market demands the needs for wealthy (core) states and poor (periphery) states. Core states benefit from the hierarchical structure of international trade and labor. World systems theory follows the logic that international wars or multinational financial disputes can be explained as attempts to change a location within the global market for a specific state or groups of states; these changes can have the objective to gain more control over the global market (to become a core country), while causing another nation to lose control over the world market. As the two groups grew apart in power, world systems theorists to established another group, the semi-periphery, to act as the middle group.&lt;ref name="theory"&gt;Ross, Robert J. S. and Kent C. Trachte. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrFzvcrvOxMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=global+capitalism+the+new+leviathan&amp;ei=UoMJTIakC5WWyQTbjfSyBw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world%20systems%20theory%22&amp;f=false Global Capitalism: the New Leviathan'']] (p.51-54). Albany: State University of New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-7914-0339-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref applies to the whole para--&gt;

[[Semi-periphery countries]] usually surround the core countries both in a physical and fundamental sense. The semi-periphery countries act as the middle men between the core and the periphery countries - by giving the wealthy countries what they receive from the poor countries. The [[periphery countries]] are the poorer countries usually specializing in farming and have access natural resources - which the core countries use to profit from.&lt;ref name="diversesociety"&gt;Anderson, Margaret L. and Howard F. Taylor. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA254 Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society]'' (p.254). Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 2007. {{ISBN|0-495-10236-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref applies to the whole para--&gt;

==Key qualifiers==
In order for a country to remain a core or to become a core, possible investors must be kept in mind when nation's policies are planned. Core countries change with time due to many different factors including changes in geographic favoritism and regional affluence. Alterations in financing plans by companies will also play a part as they change to react to the continuously evolving [[world economy|world market]].&lt;ref name=strategy&gt;Michalet, Charles Albert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ejPof5lBFnsC&amp;pg=PA22 Strategies of Multinationals and Competition for Foreign Direct Investment]'' (p.22-25). Washington D.C.: World Bank, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8213-4161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a country to be considered a core country nominee, the country must possess an independent, stable government and potential for growth in the global market and advances in technology. Although these three factors will not completely decide where a company chooses to invest – they do play extremely large roles in such decisions. A main key to becoming or remaining a core is determined by the country's government policies to encourage funding from outside.&lt;ref name=strategy/&gt;

==Main functions==
The main function of the core countries is to command and financially benefit from the world system better than the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=diversesociety/&gt;  Core countries could also be viewed as the capitalist class while the periphery countries could be viewed as a disordered working class.&lt;ref name=revolution&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btfwl-tX5r8C Revolution, a Sociological Interpretation]'' (p.100). Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1990.  {{ISBN|0-87722-736-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a capitalism-driven market, core countries exchange goods with the poor nations at an unequal rate greatly in favor of the core countries.&lt;ref name=enpolitical&gt;O’Hara, Phillip Anthony. ''[https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;id=ncgV5-fvEkoC Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2'']. London: T &amp; F Books, 2009. {{ISBN|0-203-44321-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The periphery countries’ purpose is to provide agricultural and natural resources along with the lower [[division of labor]] for larger corporations of semi-periphery and core countries. As a result of the lower priced division of labor and natural resources available, the core nations’ companies buy these products for a relatively low cost and then sell them for much higher. The periphery countries only receive low amounts of money for what they sell and must pay higher prices for anything they buy from outside their own region. Because of this continuous order, periphery countries can never earn enough to cover the costs of their imports while setting aside money to invest in better technologies. Core countries support this pattern by giving loans to the poor regions for specific investments in a raw material or type of agriculture, rather than help such regions establish themselves and balance out the world market.&lt;ref name=worldsystem&gt;Shannon, Thomas R. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U39evXuC41kC&amp;pg=PA16  An Introduction to the World-System Perspective]'' (p.16). Boulder: Westview Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8133-2452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A disadvantage to core nations is to remain a member of the core grouping, the government must retain or create new policies that encourage investments to keep in their country and not relocate.&lt;ref name=worldsystem/&gt; This can make it difficult for governments to change national standards that may sacrifice high profits.

An example of a change that capitalism does not favor is the abolition of slavery. During the early [[industrialization]] and growth of America, exports produced by slaves played a huge role in making [[businesses]] the most profit.&lt;ref name=slavery&gt;Leiman, Melvin M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-0SshE2MWREC&amp;pg=PA25 Political Economy of Racism''] (p.25-26). London: Pluto Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-7453-0487-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such movements to [[abolitionism in the United States|abolish slavery]] and spread equality caused an internal [[American Civil War|war]] within the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/support/index.php Overview support]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

{{See also|World population}}
'''[[Demographics]] of the [[world]]''' include [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health measures, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the human population of the planet [[Earth]]. 

The overall total population of the world is approximately 7.5 billion, as of March 2018. 

Its overall population density is 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile), excluding Antarctica. Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in [[Asia]] and is predominantly urban and suburban, with more than 2.5 billion in the countries of [[China]] and [[India]] combined.

== History ==
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' out of Africa across [[Eurasia]] about a million years ago. ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 50,000 - 60,000 years ago, and had spread across [[Prehistory of Australia|Australia]], [[History of Asia|Asia]] and [[Paleolithic Europe|Europe]] by 30,000 years BC. [[Models of migration to the New World|Migration to the Americas]] took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the [[Pacific Islands]] were colonized.

Until c.&amp;nbsp;10,000 years ago, humans lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as [[band societies]]. The advent of agriculture prompted the [[Neolithic Revolution]], when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent [[human settlement]]s. About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Valley]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]]. Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to [[water resources|water]] and, depending on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], other [[natural resources]] used for [[subsistence]]. But humans have a great capacity for altering their [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] by means of technology.

Since 1800, the [[human population]] has increased from one billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/411162.stm | accessdate = 5 February 2008 | work=BBC News | title=World's population reaches six billion | date=5 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over seven billion,&lt;ref name=7billpop&gt;{{cite web|title=UN population estimates.|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/p2k0data.asp|work=Population Division, United Nations|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in [[urban area]]s. In February 2008, the U.N. estimated that half the world's population would live in [[urban area]]s by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4561183.stm | work=BBC News | first=David | last=Whitehouse | title=Half of humanity set to go urban | date=19 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for humans living in [[city|cities]] include various forms of pollution and [[crime]],&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- {{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825142912/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/usrv98.htm |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df= }} --&gt;http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/usrv98.pdf Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993–98] U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,.

[[File:Population density countries 2018 world map, people per sq km.svg|300px|thumb|Population density (people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by country, 2018]]

The [[world's population]] is 7 billion&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html CIA - The World Factbook] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |date=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is 7 billion ÷ 510 million = 13.7 per km² (35.5 per sq. mile). If only the Earth's land area of 150 million km² (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 46.7 per km² (117.2 per sq. mile). This calculation includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm About.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, this number by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-states]], [[microstates]] or [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision  | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= 12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories share a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

{{Further information|List of religious populations}}

The table below lists religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, [[Cao Đài]] is listed because it claims to be a separate category from Buddhism, while [[Hòa Hảo]] is not, even though they are similar [[new religious movement]]s.

The population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.

Since the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some [[Western civilization|countries with a historically large Christian population]] have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see [[demographics of atheism]]. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the [[priest]]hood and [[monastery|monastic life]], as well as diminishing attendance at [[Church service|church]].  On the other hand, since the 19th century, large areas of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate.  In the realm of [[Western civilization]], there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as [[secular humanism|secular humanists]]. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former [[Soviet Union]], religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional [[Eastern Christianity]] and in the forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[Far Eastern religions]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0 million in 1989, to a low of 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6 million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41 million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2 billion.&lt;ref name="census1"/&gt; Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the [[Middle East]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and also in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php U.S. Census Bureau, June 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701122431/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/worldpop.php |date=1 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries experienced [[Population decline|negative population growth]], especially in [[Eastern Europe]] mainly due to low [[fertility rate]]s, high death rates and [[emigration]]. In [[Southern Africa]], growth is slowing due to the high number of [[HIV]]-related deaths.

According to the [[The World Factbook|CIA - The World Factbook]], the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm Uneca.org: Crude Birth Rates - The World and its Major Regions, 1950-2050] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816073652/http://www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/food_security_and_sustainability/programme_overview/population/fertility/crude_world.htm |date=16 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release - National Institutes of Health (NIH)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Birth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-has-one-of-highest-birth-and-lowest-death-rates-in-eu-189080-Jul2011/ |title=Ireland has one of highest birth and lowest death rates in EU |work=Thejournal.ie |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high |work=The Guardian |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/health/2011/0809/1224302081071.html |title=Germany faces up to its kinder surprise |work=The Irish Times |date=9 June 2018 |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/01/cdc.births.decline/index.html |title=CDC records rise in birth rate for women over 40 |work=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that it implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth rates ranging from 10-20 births per 1000 are considered low, while rates from 40-50 births per 1000 are considered high. There are problems associated with both an extremely high birth rate and an extremely low birth rate. High birth rates can cause stress on the government welfare and family programs to support a youthful population. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental effects that a large population can produce. Low birth rates can put stress on the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and also the stress on families to support the elders themselves. There will be less children or working age population to support the constantly growing aging population.

See [[list of countries by death rate]] for worldwide statistics.

According to the [[World Health Organization]], the 10 leading [[causes of death]] in 2002 were:
&lt;!-- ref: http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf --&gt;
# 12.6% [[Ischemic heart disease]]
#  9.7% [[Cerebrovascular disease]]
#  6.8% [[Lower respiratory infection]]s
#  4.9% [[HIV/AIDS]]
#  4.8% [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]
#  3.2% [[Diarrhoeal disease]]s
#  2.7% [[Tuberculosis]]
#  2.2% [[Trachea/bronchus/lung cancers]]
#  2.2% [[Malaria]]
#  2.1% [[Road traffic accidents]]

Causes of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] (the [[United Nations]] Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrients]]".&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''[[L'Empire de la honte]]'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}}, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who died each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—died of age-related causes in 2001, according to an article which counts all deaths "due to causes that kill hardly anyone under the age of 40" as age-related.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = 7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bettersource|| reference uses an extremely broad definition of "age-related" deaths, including even traffic accidents due to poor eyesight|date=June 2018}} In industrialized nations, the proportion was even higher according to that article, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

|}]]

The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. [[Qatar]] has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]).

The value for the entire [[world population]] is 1.02 males/female,&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA Fact Book |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |archivedate=1 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.

The "[[First World]]" [[G7]] members all have a sex ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.

Countries on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 ([[Saudi Arabia]] 1.13, [[United Arab Emirates]] 2.73, [[Qatar]] 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male [[foreign worker|guest workers]]. Conversely, countries of [[Eastern Europe]] (the [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]]) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, [[Armenia]] has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by [[human migration|emigration]] and higher male mortality as result of higher post-Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.

There is an inverse correlation between [[income and fertility]], wherein [[Developed country|developed countries]] usually have a much lower [[fertility rate]]. Various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] may be involved, such as education and urbanization. [[Mortality rate]]s are low, [[birth control]] is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable.  However, in countries like Iran where contraception was made artificially affordable before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined.  Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. However, this effect is neutralized among Nordic or liberalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage3.nifty.com/sociology/motion.html Graph Charts of TFR and FLR using Google Motion Chart using World Bank's World Development Index.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2012}}

In [[undeveloped countries]] on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to [[contraceptives]], generally lower levels of [[female education]], and lower rates of female employment in industry.

===Unemployment rate===
8.7% (2010 est.)
8.2% (2009 est.)
note: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%-12% unemployment (2007 est.)

===Demonym===
The [[demonym]] for Earth's inhabitants is [[wikt:Earthling|Earthling]] or, as either a noun or an adjective, [[wikt:Terran|Terran]].

Worldwide, [[English language|English]] is used widely as a [[lingua franca]] and can be seen to be the dominant language at this time. The world's largest language by native speakers is [[Mandarin Chinese]] which is a [[first language]] of around 960 million people, or 12.44% of the population, predominantly in [[Greater China]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is spoken by around 330 to 400 million people, predominantly in the [[Americas]] and [[Spain]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is spoken by around 280 million people. [[Hindi]] is spoken by about 200 million speakers, mostly in [[India]]. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is spoken by around 230 million people, predominantly in India and Bangladesh. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken by about 230 million speakers in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[East Timor]], and [[Southern Africa]].

There are numerous other languages, grouped into nine major families:

# [[Indo-European languages]] 46% ([[Europe]], [[Western Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Oceania]])
# [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] 21% ([[East Asia]])
# [[Niger–Congo languages]] 6.4% ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
# [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] 6.0% ([[North Africa]] to [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Western Asia]])
# [[Austronesian languages]] 5.9% ([[Oceania]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]])
# [[Dravidian languages]] 3.7% ([[South Asia]])
# [[Altaic languages]] (controversial combination of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic families) 2.3% ([[Central Asia]], [[North Asia]] ([[Siberia]]), and [[Anatolia]])&lt;ref&gt;Since the Mongolic and Tungusic language families have only a relatively small number of speakers, the majority of the Altaic percentage represents speakers of Turkic languages&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese dynasties ===
[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]
Around the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368—1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1296937594?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind China's lag in advancement has speculated by many scholars. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun. ''The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=308211#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Andrade, Tonio. ''The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History'', 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=4089513#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China during the Ming Dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''On their own terms: science in China, 1550-1900''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3300298#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995). Arbitrage, china and world trade in the early modern period. ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 38'', 429. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1304349602?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31038.0001.001&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty. ''The Wall Street Journal Asia''Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1508838378?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea's strong cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, Apr 15). Joseon: Korea's confucian kingdom (1). ''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

At the start of the modern era, the [[Spice Route]] between India and China crossed [[Majapahit]],&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_19"&gt;M.C. Ricklefs, ''A History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300'', 2nd ed.

It was the last of the major [[Hindu]] empires of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and is considered one of the greatest states in Indonesian history.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs_19" /&gt; Its influence extended to states in [[Sumatra]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Borneo]] and eastern Indonesia, but the effectiveness of the influence is the subject of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Prapantja, Rakawi, translated by Theodore Gauthier Pigeaud, ''Java in the 14th Century, A Study in Cultural History: The Negara-Kertagama by Pakawi Parakanca of Majapahit, 1365 AD'' (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1962), vol. 4, p. 29. 34; G.J.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[File:Hanging houses in Cuenca Spain.jpg|thumb|15th century Hanging Houses in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] from the [[Early Renaissance]], and the Early modern period.]]

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

==Atlantic World==
{{see also|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseemüller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]
A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

{{distinguish|End of the world (disambiguation)}}
The '''end of history''' is a political and philosophical concept that supposes that a particular political, economic, or social system may develop that would constitute the end-point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government. A variety of authors have argued that a particular system is the "end of history" including [[Thomas More]] in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=J. J.|title="The End of History": A Reappraisal of Marx's Views on Alienation and Human Emancipation|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique|date=1971|volume=4|issue=3|pages=367–380|jstor=3231359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Alexandre Kojève]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/kojeve-s.htm|title = History and Desire in Kojève|last = Boucher|first = Geoff|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Fukuyama]] in the 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="SpiegelFukuyamaInterview"&gt;Fukuyama himself began to revise his ideas and abandon some of the neoconservative components of his thesis since the [[Iraq War]]. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/interview-with-ex-neocon-francis-fukuyama-a-model-democracy-is-not-emerging-in-iraq-a-407315.html Interview with Ex-Neocon Francis Fukuyama: "A Model Democracy Is not Emerging in Iraq"] Spiegel Online, March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an end of history differs from ideas of an [[Eschatology|end of the world]] as expressed in various religions, which may forecast a complete destruction of the Earth or of life on Earth, and the end of the human race as we know it. The end of history instead proposes a state in which human life continues indefinitely into the future without any further major changes in society, system of governance, or economics.

==History==
The phrase, 'the end of history' was first used by French philosopher and mathematician [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1861 "to refer to the end of the historical dynamic with the perfection of civil society".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"&gt;[[Mike Featherstone]], "Global and Local Cultures", in John Bird, Barry Curtis, Tim Putnam, ''Mapping the Futures: Local Cultures, Global Change'' (1993), p. 184, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Arnold Gehlen]] adopted it in 1952 and it has been taken up more recently by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Gianni Vattimo|Vattimo]]".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"/&gt;

The formal development of an idea of an "end of history" is most closely associated with Hegel, although Hegel discussed the idea in ambiguous terms, making it unclear whether he thought such a thing was a certainty or a mere possibility.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond, "Hegel, Art, and History", in Robert L. Perkins, ed., ''History and System: Hegel's Philosophy of History'' (1984), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Postmodernism==
A postmodern understanding of the term differs in that "The idea of an 'end of history' does not imply that nothing more will ever happen. Rather, what the [[postmodern]] sense of an end of history tends to signify is, in the words of contemporary historian [[Keith Jenkins]], the idea that 'the peculiar ways in which the past was historicized (was conceptualized in modernist, linear and essentially metanarrative forms) has now come to an end of its productive life; the all-encompassing "experiment of modernity" ... is passing away into our postmodern condition'."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'' (2004), p. 89, quoting Keith Jenkins (2001), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English-language radio''' refers to radio stations that broadcast primarily in the English language and are located in countries where English is not an official language or majority language. Often referred to as "English-speaking radio" or "Expat radio" the broadcasts enables expats, vacationers and travelers to listen to radio in their native language while traveling abroad. The idea is that stations broadcast in English to popular holiday destinations such as [[Pattaya]] or the [[French Riviera]] or places with high [[Expatriate|expat]] communities. English language broadcasting also takes the form of military-backed radio such as the [[American Forces Network]]. However English-language radio based in foreign countries has to now compete with the introduction of [[internet radio]] and satellite technology that has increased listener's access to English-language radio based in "home" counties.

==History==

The first English-language radio in a foreign country transmission was thought to be in 1925 when Radio Paris broadcast from the [[Eiffel Tower]], a show about fashion design, sponsored by [[Selfridges]] of London.

With end of [[World War II]] [[American military|American]] and [[British military|British]] forces began occupation of bases within regions of conquered [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries such as [[Germany]] and [[Okinawa]] for the enjoyment and informative power radio bring to both the troops and their families. Today traditions remain as the [[American Forces Network]] and the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] continue to provide English-language entertainment and information to troops stationed abroad in their respective countries or areas.

Non-military English broadcasting gained momentum with the increase in [[globalization]] after World War II. As English-speaking business personnel and [[Expatriate|expat]] communities grew because of international trade and investment, so did the demand for English language entertainment. As the number of global English speakers has grown, demand from the local native market has grown as well. Stations that actively reach out to the local community such as [[International Community Radio Taipei]] have been on the rise.

==Location==

The location of most English-language radio stations can be determined by their proximity to large populations of English speakers. [[Geneva, Switzerland]], for example, has many English speakers and [[expatriate]]s, also the Spanish coastal areas, and thus English radio broadcasts. Radio stations in places such as [[Baja California]] and [[Costa Rica]] also serve the increasing number of English speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">The term '''G-Zero world''' refers to an emerging [[Power vacuum|vacuum of power]] in [[international politics]] created by a decline of [[Western world|Western]] influence and the domestic focus of the governments of developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks Eurasia Group Top 10 Risks of 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131233850/http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks |date=2011-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/g-zero/ G-Zero], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to explain a world in which there is no single country or group of countries that has ability and will, economically and politically, to drive a truly global agenda. 

The term G-Zero was first coined by political scientists [[Ian Bremmer]] and [[David F. Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Racanelli, Vito. [http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2011/01/26/davos-who-or-what-is-g-zero/ Davos: Who or What is G-Zero?], ''Barron’s'', January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/01/28/132742511/the-friday-podcast-g-zero The Friday Podcast: G-Zero]. NPR ''Planet Money'', January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; G-Zero became the main theme of [[Ian Bremmer|Ian Bremmer's]] book, ''[[Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World]]'' ([[Penguin Group|Portfolio]], May 2012).  

It is a reference to a perceived shift away from the preeminence of the [[G7|Group of Seven]] industrialized countries and the expanded [[G20|Group of Twenty]], which includes major emerging powers like [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Turkey]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Damian. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/damianreece/8284541/Davos-WEF-2011-East-and-West-must-cooperate-if-were-to-survive-this-economic-mess.html Davos WEF 2011: East and West must cooperate if we’re to survive this economic mess], ''The Telegraph'', January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Reece, Damian, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/8332545/G20-Paris-Sarkozy-dares-to-dream-in-a-G-Zero-world.html G20 Paris: Sarkozy Dares to Dream in a G-Zero World] ''The Telegraph'', February 18, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Parag and Leonard, Mark [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/08iht-edkhanna08.html Why China wants a G-3 World] ''The International Herald Tribune'', September 8, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; It is also a rejection of terms like [[Group of Two|G2]], often used to identify a possible strategic partnership between the U.S. and Chinese governments, or G3, which represents an attempt to align U.S., European and Japanese interests to defend [[free market democracy]] from the rise of [[State capitalism#People.27s_Republic_of_China|Chinese-inspired state-dominated capitalism]].

Those who argue that the G-Zero has become the current international order warn that the [[G7]] has become obsolete, that the [[G20]] offers too many competing visions of the proper role of government in an economy to produce well-coordinated policies, that China has no interest in the responsibilities that come with a [[Group of Two|G2]], and that America, Europe and Japan are too mired in internal problems to forge a common approach to economic and security policy. 

In an article called “From G8 to G20 to G-Zero: Why no one wants to take charge in the new global order," Ian Bremmer writes that making compromises are difficult since each country has their own values and developed countries have voters that want their leader's focus to be domestic community, not the international one. Some of these developed countries include: the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Japan. As developed countries start to focus on their domestic issues, the lack of global leadership increases which in turn increases the transnational problems. As global leadership decreases, clashes between countries are also increasing such as America and China having different views on “statedriven and free-market varieties of capitalism”. There are also issues arising in East Asia between nations such as China and Japan in the East China Sea. The U.S. has to also focus on changes in their energy sector and whether they should participate in Syria’s civil war.

Bremmer explains that governments can adapt to the G-Zero through focusing on regional solutions such as China’s deals with the [[Association of South-East Asian Nations]] (A.S.E.A.N.) and the United States’ progress on the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Governments can also form relationships with a diversity of partners. However some countries may still not be able to adapt to the G-0 because of three impacting events in the world: "China's rise, Middle East turmoil and the redesign of Europe". Countries affected by these events would be Japan, Israel and Britain. &lt;ref&gt; Ian Bremmer, [http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/06/g8-g20-g-zero-why-no-one-wants-take-charge-new-global-order "From G8 to G20 to G-Zero: Why no one wants to take charge in the new global order"], ''Newstatesman'', June 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the G-Zero has been criticized by some who argue that it overstates the decline in America’s [[political power|political]] and [[economic power]] and underestimates the willingness of [[developing countries]] to play a larger role on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/28/g-zero-gee-another-idea-with-zero-to-support-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal''' (official title: ''1. Untersuchungsausschuss „NSA“'') was started on March 20, 2014, by the [[German Parliament]] in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany in the light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]].
The Committee is also in search of strategies on how to protect telecommunication with technical means.&lt;ref&gt;http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/008/1800843.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutscher Bundestag]]: [http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss 1. Untersuchungsausschuss („NSA“)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The committee is formed by eight members of the German Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss/mitglieder/262992 Mitglieder des NSA-Untersuchungsausschusses], bundestag.de, accessed July 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentarian of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]] [[Clemens Binninger]] was head of the committee but stepped down after six days. In a statement, Binninger clarified that the other committee members had insisted on inviting Edward Snowden to testify; Binninger objected to this and resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2014/50515028_kw15_binninger/216908|title=Deutscher Bundestag - NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: Binninger tritt vom Ausschussvorsitz zurück|author=Karl Otto Sattler|date=9 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-04/nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-binninger-ruecktritt NSA-Ausschussvorsitzender geht im Streit], Zeit.de, April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Sensburg]] (CDU) succeeded him.

== Witnesses ==

=== Discussion about the witness Snowden ===
On May 8, 2014, the committee unanimously decided to let US whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] filed a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee because of the Christian Democrats' and the Social Democrats' refusal to let the witness Edward Snowden testify in Berlin. The accused proposed a video conference from Moscow which Snowden had refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014]. Website FAZ, accessed September 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel. According to them, she refuses to comply with her duty according to Chapter 44 of the German constitution to ensure a real investigation; especially by refusing to ensure the legal requirements to allow the witness Edward Snowden to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-spaehaffaere-opposition-verklagt-merkel-wegen-snowden-a-994029.html|title=NSA Sphaffre: Opposition verklagt Merkel wegen Snowden  - SPIEGEL ONLINE|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=28 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testimony of Binney and Drake ===
On July 3, 2014, the former Technical Director of the NSA,  [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], who had become a whistleblower after the [[9/11|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], testified to the committee. He said that the NSA has a totalitarian approach that has previously only been known from dictatorships and that there is no longer such a thing as privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-9-11-hat-alles-veraendert.aeedf44b-6825-4583-a740-0c20c0bd723a.html|title=NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: 9/11  hat alles verändert - Politik - Stuttgarter Zeitung|author=Stuttgarter Zeitung|location=Stuttgart, Germany|date=3 July 2014|work=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/william-binney-als-zeuge-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-a-979062.html Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag: US-Informant vergleicht NSA mit einer Diktatur], Der Spiegel, July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Former NSA employee [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German foreign intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thomas-drake-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-13027055.html Bundesnachrichtendienst „ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA“], FAZ July 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-nsa-mitarbeiter-drake-bnd-unterstuetzte-drohnenkrieg-der-usa-a-979130.html|title=Ex-NSA-Mitarbeiter Drake: BND untersttzte Drohnenkrieg der USA|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed testimony of Greenwald ===
The US journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] was asked to testify in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, he wrote in a letter that he was willing to support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their refusal to let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a "ritual" that "shall seem like an investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glenn-greenwald-sagt-zeugenvernehmung-vor-nsa-ausschuss-ab-a-984030.html|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Zeugenvernehmung vor NSA-Ausschuss ab|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=1 August 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2014/glenn-greenwald-sagt-untersuchungsausschuss-ab-ritual-das-die-illusion-einer-untersuchung-erwecken-soll|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Untersuchungsausschuss ab: "Ritual, das die Illusion einer Untersuchung erwecken soll"|work=netzpolitik.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Eikonal selectors==
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" from the NSA − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative Parliamentary Committee was set up in spring 2014 and reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstaffäre: Sonderermittler spricht von klarem Vertragsbruch der NSA|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-selektorenliste-kurt-graulich-spricht-von-klarem-vertragsbruch-a-1060280.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstkontrolleure: BND hat gegen Recht und Auftrag verstoßen|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Geheimdienstkontrolleure-BND-hat-gegen-Recht-und-Auftrag-verstossen-3045627.html|publisher=Heise Online|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BND hat jahrelang unter Freunden spioniert|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bnd-hat-jahrelang-unter-freunden-spioniert/a-19393446|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Markus|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: BND spitzelte mit eigenen Selektoren|url=http://www.fr-online.de/datenschutz/geheimdienst-affaere-bnd-spitzelte-mit-eigenen-selektoren,1472644,32163156.html|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus Landefeld]], member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somaskanda|first1=Sumi|title=Is Big Brother coming to Germany?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/big-brother-coming-germany-161213062129779.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spying on the committee ==
On July 4, 2014, it was revealed to the public that BND agent Markus R. had been arrested on July 2, 2014, for apparently having spied. The 31-year-old German is accused of having worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neue-medienberichte-festgenommener-bnd-mann-spionierte-auch-fuer-die-cia-1.2032849 Medien: Festgenommener BND-Mann spionierte für CIA], Süddeutsche.de, July 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, the US ambassador [[John B.

It was revealed that the BND-agent had saved 218 secret BND documents on USB sticks since 2012 and sold them to US agents for a sum of 25,000 Euro in Salzburg, Austria. At least three of the documents were about the NSA Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Festnahme-BND-Mitarbeiter-soll-NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss-ausspioniert-haben-2249652.html|title=Festnahme: BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss ausspioniert haben|date=4 July 2014|work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] had mistaken him for a Russian spy and asked US colleagues to help uncover him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-verfassungsschutz-wollte-agenten-mit-us-hilfe-enttarnen-a-979416.html|title=BND: Verfassungsschutz wollte Agenten mit US-Hilfe enttarnen|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=5 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a Parliament technician found out that the mobile phone of [[Roderich Kiesewetter]], representative of the Christian Democratic Union in the committee, was spied on. Kiesewetter said there is evidence that all four Party representatives in the committee have been spied on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/ulm/kiesewetter-offenbar-abgehoert/-/id=1612/did=13735756/nid=1612/1hqz7ou/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document leaks ==
In the months following May 2015, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the Austrian parliament for the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], disclosed several documents and transcripts related to [[operation Eikonal]], in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of [[Deutsche Telekom]] in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2015/11/unnoticed-leak-answers-and-raises.html Unnoticed leak answers and raises questions about operation Eikonal], November 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.format.at/articles/1430/930/376970/spionage-peter-pilz-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss|title=Spionage: Peter Pilz fordert einen NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss|author=news networld Internetservice GmbH|work=format.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2016, [[WikiLeaks]] released over 2,400 documents which it claims are from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Uchill |first=Joe |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/308407-wikileaks-drops-docs-on-inquiry-into-nsa-german-cooperation |title=WikiLeaks publishes docs on inquiry into German cooperation with NSA |work=The Hill |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Handwashing Day''' ('''GHD''') is a campaign to motivate and mobilize people around the [[world]] to improve their [[Hand washing|handwashing]] habits.  Washing hands at critical points during the day and washing with [[soap]] are both important. 

Global Handwashing Day occurs on 15 October of each year. The global campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of handwashing with soap as a key factor in [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20091015004104007&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Lae Marks Global Handwashing Day|last = Rai|first = Frank|date = 12 August 2009|work = Post-Courier (Papua New Guinea)|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-50%.

==Implementation and management==
The Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) (formerly called "[[Public-private partnership|Public Private Partnership]]&amp;nbsp;for Handwashing" (PPPHW)) established Global Handwashing Day in 2008 as a way to promote a global and local vision of handwashing with soap.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=12 October 2012|title=Global Handwashing Day|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=82513752&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=61|issue=40|page=821|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering Committee members of the GHP include Colgate-Palmolive; FHI 360; The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Procter &amp; Gamble; UNICEF; Unilever; University at Buffalo; USAID; the Water and Sanitation Programme at the World Bank; and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=The Global Handwashing Partnership|website=globalhandwashing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued research on handwashing habits and practices is commissioned in conjunction with GHD. In 2011, [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA), sponsored a study to assess the handwashing habits of American and Canadian adults, finding that many were not using soap when washing their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=bizwire.c37268574&amp;site=ehost-live|title = New Research Reveals Poor Handwashing Practices|last = |first = |date = 14 October 2011|work = Business Wire|access-date = 10 August 2015|via = Regional Business News – EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
The aims of Global Handwashing Day are to:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Foster and support a general culture of handwashing with soap in all societies
* Shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing in each country
* Raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing with soap.

==Activities==
Each year, over 200 million people celebrate Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208100034/http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sometimes, groups choose to celebrate GHD on other dates than 15 October. In [[Ethiopia]], 300 people celebrated Global Handwashing Day in [[Addis Ababa]] on 1 November in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://unicefethiopia.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/ethiopia-celebrates-global-handwashing-day/|title = Ethiopia Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last = Bizuwork|first = Demissew|date = 4 November 2013|work = UNICEF Ethiopia|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 October 2015, Lupok Central Elementary School, Guiuan Eastern Samar, Philippines celebrated the Global Handwashing Day by doing the proper handwashing before starting classes.

==History==
Global Handwashing Day was initiated by the Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) in August 2008 at the annual [[World Water Week]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/our-history/|title = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing – Our History|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the first Global Handwashing Day took place on 15 October 2008. The date was appointed by the UN General Assembly. The year 2008 was also the [[International Year of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/gpsc/events/2008/15_10_08/en/index.html|title = Global Handwashing Day|date = 15 October 2008|accessdate = 24 July 2015|website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding bodies in 2008 included: FHI360 (a nonprofit human development organization based in the US),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhi360.org/about-us|title=fhi360 About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=fhi360|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[UNICEF]], [[Unilever]], [[Water and sanitation program|World Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Program]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

===Themes===
*The focus for Global Handwashing Day's inaugural year in 2008 was school children. In that year, the members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than 70 countries. In [[India]] in 2008, [[cricket]] legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and his teammates joined an estimated 100 million schoolchildren around the country in lathering up for better health and hygiene as part of the first Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_45974.html|title = Star Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar Promotes Handwashing in India|last = Walker|first = Angela|date = 16 October 2008|work = UNICEF|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was initiated to reduce childhood mortality rates and related [[respiratory]] and [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with [[soap]]. This simple action can reduce the [[mortality rate]] of respiratory disease by 25%. Death from diarrheal diseases can be reduced by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|date=May 2003|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, more than 60 percent of health workers do not adhere to proper hand hygiene. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US health care providers, on average, wash their hands less than half of the time they should. On any given day, one in 25 US hospital patients has at least one health care-associated infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of handwashing ===
{{Main article|Handwashing}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}
Handwashing with soap is very effective and the least expensive way to prevent [[diarrhea]] and [[acute respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=6FI3204107250&amp;site=ehost-live|title=MOH Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last=|first=|date=15 October 2009|work=Arabia 2000|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonia]], a major ARI (acute respiratory infection), is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, killing an estimated 1.8&amp;nbsp;million children per year. [[Diarrhea]] and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5&amp;nbsp;million child deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf|title=The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwashing with soap is estimated to reduce cases of diarrhea by 30% and respiratory infections by 21% in children under the age of five.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to make handwashing into a [[habit]]. Good handwashing with soap before [[eating]] and after using the toilet into a regular habit can save more lives than any single [[vaccine]] or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute [[respiratory infection]]s by one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2013/today-is-global-handwashing-day/|title=Today is Global Handwashing Day|last=Larsen|first=Linda|date=15 October 2013|work=Food Poisoning Bulletin|access-date=24 July 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwashing is usually done together with other [[sanitation]] interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene [[WASH]] programmes.

The Global Handwashing Day helps raise awareness of the importance of washing with soap, but it also makes it fun for children to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=wapo.ea30fbe0-e86a-11e0-8a05-c10ec107dc66&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Getting All Lathered Up|last=Sawyer|first=Kem Knapp|date=10 October 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Regional Business News – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper hygiene requires that individuals know the importance of good hygiene and develop the habits to carry it out.  There are people with plenty of money but nonetheless, they lack the important habits of timely handwashing with soap, and thereby unknowingly endanger themselves and others around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/global-handwashing-day-in_b_5989280.html|title=Global Handwashing Day in the Time of Ebola|author=Jeffrey Sachs|author2=Myriam Sidibe|date=15 October 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peer pressure|Peer influence]] is significant to seeing increased handwashing among students. In a study conducted in [[Kenya]], researchers found that students were much more likely to wash their hands when another student is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Amy J.|last2=Blum|first2=Annalise G.|last3=Breiman|first3=Robert F.|last4=Ram|first4=Pavani K.|last5=Davis|first5=Jennifer|date=27 March 2014|title=Video Surveillance Captures Student Hand Hygiene Behavior, Reactivity to Observation, and Peer Influence in Kenyan Primary Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92571|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|pmc=3968003|pmid=24676389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer influence is only successful, however, when students know that handwashing is a desirable action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6401">The '''Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health''' was a program of the [[United Nations]] (UN) directed at improving women's and children's health in the developing world.

The program was announced by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] in September 2010. At the time of the announcement, the program was valued at $US40 billion over a five-year period, funded by state and private donors,&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEjj_XD4L21sQLY3DEogHXxLXQHAD9ICPTGG0|title=UN promotes health campaign for women, children|last=Snow|first=Anita|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN hoping for more pledges to follow.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; The objective of the program was to save the lives of 16 million people during the period of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11392954|title=UN launches $40bn woman and child health plan|date=22 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Millennium Development Goals]] 4, 5 and 6 were showing the slowest rate of progression, this program was also instituted to gain momentum in achieving them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/node/8936/pdf/ewec_progress_report_final_3.pdf|title=Saving Lives Protecting Futures: Progress Report on the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health 2010-2015|work=Resource Centre|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the program was led by the [[World Health Organization]], reporting to the UN.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

The aid-based program was accompanied by pledges from some developing nations (including [[Tanzania]] and [[Rwanda]]) to increase their own domestic spending on health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2010/sep/22/millennium-development-goals-governments-pledge|title=Millennium development goals: governments pledge £25.5bn to eradicate world poverty|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|author2=Curtis, Polly|date=22 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN, around $8.6 million of the program's funding came from what it described as "low-income countries".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68L1K820100922|title=U.N. chief to launch women, children health drive|last=Worsnip|first=Patrick|date=22 September 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International aid group [[Oxfam]] expressed doubts about the program, including the extent to which its funding was genuinely new.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

== Progress: 2010-2015 ==
The Global Strategy managed to improve the coordination of global efforts towards the improvement of women’s and children’s health as well as enhancing strategies to tackle this. It gave rise to the “Every Woman Every Child” movement, which assisted in the mobilisation of stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite not reaching targets, reductions in both child and [[Maternal Mortality|maternal mortality]] were noted; of 49% and 45% respectively from 1990 to 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Temmerman|first=Marleen|last2=Khosla|first2=Rajat|last3=Bhutta|first3=Zulfiqar A.|last4=Bustreo|first4=Flavia|date=2015-09-14|title=Towards a new Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4414|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=351|pages=h4414|doi=10.1136/bmj.h4414|issn=1756-1833|pmid=26371228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.4 million maternal and child deaths were prevented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, [[oral rehydration therapy]] and exclusive breastfeeding coverage showed the most significant improvement, however, progress in [[vaccination]] and [[pneumonia]] was still lagging.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] also reported increased collaboration with the private sector, with an increase in donor funding of US$19.8 billion noted from September 2010 to May 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-2015 ==
The Global Health Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents 2016-2030 was launched in September 2015, building on experience gained from 2010-2015, with the inclusion of adolescents as an additional target group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is aligned with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) and has 3 main objectives; namely for women, adolescents and children to "survive", "thrive" and "transform".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuruvilla|first=Shyama|last2=Bustreo|first2=Flavia|last3=Kuo|first3=Taona|last4=Mishra|first4=CK|last5=Taylor|first5=Katie|last6=Fogstad|first6=Helga|last7=Gupta|first7=Geeta Rao|last8=Gilmore|first8=Kate|last9=Temmerman|first9=Marleen|date=2016-05-01|title=TheGlobal strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016–2030): a roadmap based on evidence and country experience|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=94|issue=5|pages=398–400|doi=10.2471/blt.16.170431|issn=0042-9686|pmc=4850541|pmid=27147772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an evidence-based, multi-sectoral approach and emphasises the need to address equity, with interventions applied across the life-course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/life-course/partners/global-strategy/ewec-globalstrategyreport-200915.pdf|title=The Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health (2016-2030)|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global citizenship education ====
{{Main|Global Citizenship Education}}

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

New York: Economic Policy Institute and Teachers College. {{ISBN|978-0807748817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audrey Osler, director of the ''Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights Education'', the [[University of Leeds]], affirms that "Education for living together in an interdependent world is not an optional extra, but an essential foundation".&lt;ref&gt;Osler, Audrey and Hugh Starkey  (2010). ''Teachers and Human Rights Education.''  London:Trentham Books. {{ISBN|978-1858563848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

====UN General Assembly====
On 10 December 1948, the UN General Assembly Adopted Resolution 217A (III), also known as "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml "History of the Document." U.N.: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1 states that "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 2 states that "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====US Declaration of Independence====
The opening of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776, states as follows:

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]];&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Social movements==

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global silver trade''' between the Americas and [[Europe]] from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries was a spillover of the [[Columbian Exchange]] which had a profound effect on the world economy. In fact, many scholars consider the [[silver]] trade to mark the beginning of a genuinely [[global economy]], with one historian noting that silver "went round the world and made the world go round."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age|last=Frank|first=Andre G.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although global, much of that silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese, as they accepted it as a form of currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China’s Seventeenth Century Monetary Crisis|url=|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=2|pages=132|quote=... silver wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the global economic changes the silver trade engendered, it also put into motion a wide array of political transformations in the early modern era. "New World mines," concluded several prominent historians "supported the Spanish empire," acting as a linchpin of the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a 'Silver Spoon'|url=|journal=Journal of World History|volume=2|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards at the time of the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] discovered vast amounts of silver, much of which was from the [[Potosí]] silver mines, to fuel their trade economy. Potosí's deposits were rich and Spanish American silver mines were the world's cheapest sources of it. The Spanish acquired the silver, minting it into the peso de ocho (a currency) to then use it as a means of purchase; that currency was so widespread that even the United States accepted it as valid until the [[Coinage Act of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=011/llsl011.db&amp;recNum=184|title=A Century of Lawmaking|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Spanish need for silver increased, new innovations for more efficient extraction of silver were developed, such as the amalgamation method of using [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to extract silver from ore.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the two centuries that followed the discovery of Potosí, the Spanish silver mines in the Americas produced 40,000 tons of silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silver, Trade, and War: Spain and America in the Making of Early Modern Europe|last=Stein|first=Stanley J.|last2=Stein|first2=Barbara H.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, more than 150,000 tons of silver were shipped from Potosí by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/potosi-silver-mines|title=Potosí Silver Mines|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1500 to 1800, Mexico and Peru produced about 80%&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh062p201.pdf|journal=Journal of World History|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the world's silver with 30% of it eventually ending up in China (largely because of British merchants who used it to purchase exotic Chinese commodities).  In the late 16th and early 17th century, Japan was also exporting heavily into China and the foreign trade at large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As has been demonstrated, China dominated silver imports. The market value of silver in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] territory was double its value elsewhere, which provided great arbitrage profit for the Europeans and Japanese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The abundance of silver in China made it easy for the country to mint it into coinage. That process was so widespread that local Chinese government officials would demand taxes to be paid in silver to the point that silver eventually backed all of [[China's economy]].

==First paper money==
The world's first [[paper money]] ("[[flying money]]") was invented by the Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Weksel: Bill of Exchange and Promissory Note|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|publisher=Xlibris|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they needed some commodity to back it. Traditional coins were useful, but the amount of coins needed for large purchases could be bulky and dangerous to transport. That problem was solved when the Chinese created small pieces of paper with pictures of the coin printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Money|last=Weatherford|first=Jack|publisher=Crown Business|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nature of their geography, China had no real amount of precious metals of their own to back the paper money they invented. Because the Spaniards didn't find gold but did find copious amounts of silver, the Spaniards and the rest of Europe used this silver to purchase the commodities of choice from China, solving both of their problems.&lt;ref name="columbia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s5/s5_4.html |title=China and Europe, 1500–2000 and Beyond: What is Modern? |publisher=Afe.easia.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silver in the Americas ==
[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|Silver Peso of Philip V]]
A result of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] was the discovery, production, and trade of precious metals. The Spanish, along with other European nations, had a great desire for Chinese goods such as [[silk industry in China|silk]] and [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995|title=Born with a "Silver Spoon": The Origin of World Trade in 1571|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078638|journal=Journal of World History|volume=6|issue=2|pages=201–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans did not have any goods or commodities which China desired, so they traded silver to make up for their trade deficit.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reorient|last=Frank|first=Andre|publisher=|year=July 1998|isbn=9780520214743|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important mining colonies of the [[Spanish Empire]] were Peru and Mexico, who were estimated to have provided one-hundred thousand tons of silver from the mid 16th Century to the end of the colonial period.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Richard L.|date=1988|title=Long-Term Silver Mining Trends in Spanish America: A Comparative Analysis of Peru and Mexico|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1863529|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=93|issue=4|pages=898–935|doi=10.2307/1863529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The richest, and most productive mine in the Americas was that of [[Potosí]] in what is modern day Bolivia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The richest camp in Mexico was in the city of Zacatecas, however the production of this mine was far less than that of Potosi.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Mining Processes in the Americas ===
More simplistic native mining techniques dominated American mining for the early part of the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brading|first=D. A.|last2=Cross|first2=Harry E.|date=1972|title=Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2512781|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=545–579|doi=10.2307/2512781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining in the Americas became formally industrialized when the process of mercury amalgamation became popularized. Mercury amalgamation was invented by a Spaniard in central Mexico in the 1550s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Historians dispute what individual was the first to invent the process, however most agree that it was a Spaniard. Mercury was the one of the highest costs of production for the Americas, since much of it had to be shipped.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ratio of Mercury to silver produced was about two to one.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, German miners introduced the [[stamp mill]] and [[lead smelting]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gunpowder was often used to blast of large holes to create the mine shafts, although there were not many deep shafts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Potosí had the most amount of ore, however it was lower quality than that of Mexico.

Mining production in the Americas largely depended on native labor in both Mexico and Peru.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Mexico, many of the natives worked as wage laborers by the middle of the 17th Century.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48249030|title=Mexico : from the beginning to the Spanish Conquest|last=1946-|first=Knight, Alan,|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052181474X|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=48249030}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the labor system known as the [[repartimiento]] still existed in some places.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Silver production in Mexico was relatively cheap when compared to that of Peru, and the general trend of Mexican labor systems was that towards waged labor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Peru mines, the [[Mit'a|mit'a system]] was a dominant form of native labor subjection, although waged laborers worked on the mines as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Natives under the mit'a system were paid much less, and this was necessary for the production of silver to continue in Peru where costs were relatively high.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Global Flow of Silver ==
The ultimate destination for the mass amounts of silver produced in the Americas and Japan was China.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giráldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078977|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver from the Americas flowed mostly across the Atlantic and made its way to the far east.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A popular route was around the Cape of Good Hope into the east, and sometimes it came over land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Major outposts for the silver trade were located in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis O.|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1996|title=Silk for Silver: Manila-Macao Trade in the 17th Century|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42634185|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=44|issue=1|pages=52–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Manilla served as a primary outpost of the exchange of goods between the Americas, Japan, and China.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, there is a large amount of silver that crossed across the Pacific Ocean directly from the Americas as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are not many records of the amount of silver which crossed the Pacific due to it being discouraged by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], so estimates highly vary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Silver also found its way across other parts of the world as well. India and Europe both received a fair amount of silver.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This silver was often locally traded for other commodities, such as gold or crops. In India, silver flowed from the south to the north, and gold flowed the opposite way.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Often silver and gold were manufactured into jewelry or hoarded as treasure.

=== China and the Demand for Silver ===
China was the ultimate destination in which silver would flow towards. In exchange, the Chinese traded their popular goods such as [[silk]] and [[porcelain]]. China had a high demand for silver due to its shift from paper money to coins in the early period of the Ming Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Glahn|first=Richard|date=1996|title=Myth and Reality of China's Seventeenth-Century Monetary Crisis|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123972|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=56|issue=2|pages=429–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming paper currency eventually failed due to self-imposed inflation along with an inability to stop the production of counterfeit bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Shikuan|date=|title=The Sung and Ming Paper Monies: Currency Competition and Currency Bubbles|url=|journal=National Taiwan University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ming attempted to produce copper coins as a new form of currency, but production was inconsistent.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Hence silver became of high value because it was a valid currency that could be processed abroad. The bimetallic ratio of silver to gold was about two to one, which meant that European and Japanese merchants made a large amount of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell|first=William S.|date=2005|title=Another Look at Silver Imports into China, ca. 1635-1644|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20079347|journal=Journal of World History|volume=16|issue=4|pages=467–489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1640s, the bimetallic ratios in China converged with the rest of the world, before experiencing another population boom.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The new population boom was a product of the introduction of New World crops into China, mainly sweet potatoes, which could be more easily grown.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; By this time, the silver mines in Japan were largely depleted and the New World became China's primary source for silver.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Initially, Japan served as China's primary source for silver in the 16th Century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In exchange for silver, China would provide Japan with silk and gold.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Japan and China did not directly trade with each other, due to political tensions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This meant that European entities and countries, such as the Dutch and Portuguese served as a middle man between the two countries.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== China's Silver Dominance ===
In the famed ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' [[Adam Smith]] noted the sheer force and great reach of the global silver trade. He was impressed by its market value but more intrigued with the way this single item of commerce brought together new and old worlds i.e. the Americas and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53006965|title=The wealth of nations|last=1723-1790.|first=Smith, Adam,|date=2003|publisher=Bantam Classic|others=Cannan, Edwin, 1861-1935.|isbn=0553585975|edition=Bantam classic|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=53006965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although China acted as the cog running the wheel of global trade, Japan's huge contribution of silver exports to China were critical to the world economy and China's liquidity and success with the commodity. Historians posit Europeans would have been left out of world trade, and China may have fallen prey to conquest by settlers of the Americas if not for Japanese silver mining. Silver was paramount to East Asia's introduction into the global trade market.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis Owen|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=2002|title=Cycles of Silver: Global Economic Unity through the Mid-Eighteenth Century|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|journal=Journal of World History|volume=13|issue=2|pages=391–427|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0035|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] empires, China hoarded silver to boost its economy and increase its trading power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Early Modern Era Trade, Power, and Belief.|last=Reid|first=Anthony J.S.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historians argue that silver was responsible for the birth of global economics and trade. According to this view, global trade commenced in 1571 when [[Manila]] was founded and became the first trading post linking America and Asia due to the expansive and profitable silver trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Dennis|last2=Giraldez|first2=Arturo|date=1995-01-01|title=Arbitrage, China, and World Trade in the Early Modern Period|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568520952600308|journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient|volume=38|issue=4|pages=429–448|doi=10.1163/1568520952600308|issn=0022-4995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, research shows the amount of silver traveling from Manila to China was approximately three million [[peso]]s or 94,000 kilograms in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atwell, wen-t'i|first=William S., Ch'ing-shih|date=December 1977|title=Notes on Silver, Foreign Trade, and the Late Ming Economy|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/398568|journal=3|volume=|pages=1–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarity of silver production was seen as an opportunity for China to control the currency's value and support its own national currency. Silver was one of the only accepted trade items from Europeans and its value in China was astronomical compared to rest of the world. In fact, its value was twice that of [[Spain]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Flynn 2002 391–427"/&gt; Between 1600 and 1800 China received 100 tons of silver on average per year. A large populace near the [[Yangtze River Delta|Lower Yangzte]] averaged a hundreds of [[tael]]s of silver per household in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=Financial management|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511735400.011|work=Taxation and Governmental Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China|pages=266–305|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511735400|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silver even played a large role when defending [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attemptive take over of Ming ruled [[Joseon|Joseon Korea]]. The Ming Ministiry of War sent approximately 140,000 liang of silver to its soldiers and required provinces to provide silver as tax for the war effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843883049|title=A dragon's head and a serpent's tail : Ming China and the first great East Asian war, 1592-1598|last=Kenneth.|first=Swope,|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806185026|location=Norman|oclc=843883049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixteenth century, the [[Daimyō|daimyos]] of Southwest Japan hoped for unhinged global trade but were stopped due to Ming China trade policies. Still, Japan became a player in the global economy via frequent Ming merchant ships arriving to extract Japan's abundance of silver and exchange goods. Japan increased its wealth through successful trilateral trade with [[Portugal]] and China as Japan now had Chinese goods to offer the Portuguese who had silver mines of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobata|first=A.|date=1965|title=The Production and Uses of Gold and Silver in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Japan|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2592093|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=245|doi=10.2307/2592093|issn=0013-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founder of the Ming China dynasty, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu,]] actually sought to eliminate silver from the market due to his fear of inflation which he previously experienced in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasty. His attempt involved imposing harsh limits on silver mining to stop its flow into the market and subsequently replaced it with baochao or paper money. However, the currency never popularized and silver proved its mainstay as a global currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Joseph P.|last2=Brook|first2=Timothy|date=1999|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2672136|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=72|issue=2|pages=267|doi=10.2307/2672136|issn=0030-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opium Wars==
{{Main|Opium Wars}}
Despite some restrictions, silver continued to drive trade through its popularity in Europe. This, combined with a high British demand for [[Chinese tea]], created chronic trade deficits for European governments, which were forced to risk silver deficits to supply merchants in Asia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Immobile Empire—The first great collision of East and West—the astonishing history of Britain's grand, ill-fated expedition to open China to Western Trade, 1792–94|last=Peyrefitte|first=Alain|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As supplies of silver decreased in Europe, Europeans had less ability to purchase highly coveted Chinese goods. Merchants were no longer able to sustain the China trade through profits made by selling Chinese goods in the West and were forced to take bullion out of circulation in Europe to buy goods in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000|last=Gray|first=Jack|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, American merchants began to introduce opium to Chinese markets. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable that Chinese opium dealers began to seek out more suppliers of the drug, thus inaugurating the opium trade; one merchant declared that Opium "is like gold. It can sell any time."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing Dynasty needed to finance the suppression of the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Voyage of the 'Frolic': New England Merchants and the Opium Trade|last=Layton|first=Thomas N.|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing imperial court debated whether and how to end the opium trade, eventually settling on regulations on consumption. That measure, however, resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by Europeans and Chinese traders. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the matter, declaring, "Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Documentary Chronicle of Sino-Western relations|last=Fu|first=Lo-shu|publisher=|year=1966|isbn=|volume=1|location=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a debate at court in 1836 on whether to legalize the drug or crack down on its use, the emperor decided on the latter. An upright official, Commissioner Lin Zexu led the campaign against opium as a kind of "drug czar." The British, offended by the seizure of their property in opium, sent a large naval expedition to China to end the restrictive conditions under which they had long traded with that country. Thus began the first Opium War, in which Britain's industrialized military might was proven in China's rout. The [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ended the war in 1842 largely on British terms, imposed numerous restrictions on Chinese sovereignty and opened five ports to European traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Taking of Hong Kong: Charles and Clara Elliot in China Waters|last=Hoe|first=Susanna|last2=Roebuck|first2=Derek|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International health''', also called '''''geographic medicine''''', '''''[[international medicine]]''''', or '''''[[global health]]''''', is a field of [[health]] care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. One subset of international medicine, [[travel medicine]], prepares travelers with immunizations, prophylactic medications, preventive techniques such as bednets and residual pesticides, in-transit care, and post-travel care for exotic illnesses. International health, however, more often refers to health personnel or organizations from one area or nation providing direct health care, or health sector development, in another area or nation. It is this sense of the term that is explained here. More recently, [[public health]] experts have become interested in global processes that impact on human health. [[Globalization and health]], for example, illustrates the complex and changing sociological environment within which the determinants of [[health]] and [[disease]] express themselves.

==International health governance==
The World Health Organization (WHO) is the international body primarily responsible for regulating and governing health-related policies and practices across nations. While the WHO uses various policies and treaties to address international health issues, many of their policies have no binding power and thus state compliance is often limited. As a result, a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) has recently been proposed as a global health treaty that would use stronger domestic accountability mechanisms (including incentives &amp; sanctions) in order to close national and global health inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhealthtreaty.org|title=FCGH - Framework  Convention for Global Health|website=www.globalhealthtreaty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars have addressed concerns regarding the FCGH, arguing that it would duplicate other global health governance efforts, lack feasibility, and have limited impact in regulating global health.&lt;ref&gt; S.J. Hoffman, J-A. Røttingen. 2013. "Dark Sides of the Proposed Framework Convention on Global Health's Many Virtues: A Systematic Review and Critical Analysis," Health &amp; Human Rights Journal 15(1): 117-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of NGOs==

Much work in international health is performed by [[non-governmental organizations]], or NGOs. Services provided by international health NGOs include direct health care, community potable water, vitamin supplementation, and mitigation of endemic and epidemic infectious diseases and malnutrition. Examples of NGOs dedicated to international health include:
* [[Pakistan Heart Foundation]]
* [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]]
* [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (''Doctors Without Borders'')
* The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]
* [[International Medical Corps]]
* [[Oxfam]]
* [[Partners in Health]]
* [[Project HOPE (USA)|Project HOPE]]
* [[Save the Children]]

==In harm's way==

These organizations often go in harm's way to provide services to people affected by natural disaster or conflict. For example, Médecins Sans Frontières has lost members in the [[Darfur]] area, and Care International's Iraq Director, [[Margaret Hassan]] (a long-time Iraq resident with dual Iraqi-British citizenship) was brutally murdered on the Internet by [[Al Qaeda]]-affiliated terrorists for the "crime" of providing services equitably among Iraqis. International Medical Corps was begun in response to the suffering of the Afghan people after the Soviet invasion of 1979, and is adept at providing services in dangerous places (see [[Attacks on humanitarian workers]]).

==The role of international health NGOs in international development==

Health-related NGOs also provide capacity development in areas of need; that is, helping nations develop sustainable domestic health solutions through training programs. An example of this type of aid is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080215182327/http://www.cirnetwork.org/content.cfm?id=5B&amp;newCommunity&amp;CFID=2167600&amp;CFTOKEN=29744944 Center for International Rehabilitation], which has provided rehabilitation training for Iraqi physical therapists, physicians, and rehabilitation clinic managers in Tuzla, Bosnia and Amman, Jordan. These trainees then care for amputees, spinal and head injury patients in their home country.

==NGOs vs. missionaries==

One important characteristic of NGO work is that, in the "pure" sense, they provide services based solely upon need, without political, ethnic, religious or other considerations. Thus, strictly speaking, religious [[missionary]] organizations that perform services as part of a proselytizing or evangelical campaign should be separated from the NGO category and simply be referred to as religious missionary organizations. Some religious relief organizations do provide services more as a duty or "charity", however, without requirements for the recipients to attend any preaching, prayer or other religious preconditions.ngo

==Harnessing the power of technology==

As NGO practice evolves parallel with technology, NGOs have developed more scientific and precise methods of assessment, planning and operations in humanitarian assistance and complex emergencies. One example is the [[Sphere Project]]'s  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response]. They have taken other new tools into the planning offices and field: in addition to the obligatory laptop computer, they typically rely heavily upon cellular and satellite communications, the Internet, and geographic information services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/IMToolbox/web/03_Map.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208124849/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/IMToolBox/web/03_Map.html |archivedate=2008-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or GIS. These technological improvements allow them to better focus efforts in areas of need, respond to evolving crises, and predict future needs. Indeed, in a related effort, the [[United States Holocaust Museum]] teamed with [[Google Earth]] to establish baseline GIS photos of crisis-torn Darfur, updating them at intervals, and uploading them to the Internet for public access. Since Internet "surfers" can browse these images and see where once-present villages are later obliterated, this teamwork gave lie to the Sudanese claim that it was engaging in neither ethnic cleansing nor genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/projects/darfur/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224130801/http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/projects/darfur/ |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The U.S. Department of Defense==

In another teamwork effort, the [[S. Ward Casscells|Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)]] of the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], as the DoD's senior medical officer, established the International Health Division[https://web.archive.org/web/20081224235922/http://fhp.osd.mil/intlhealth/] in late 2007 to help coordinate military health doctrine and practices in international development. The International Health Division places great emphasis upon working with NGOs to provide sustainable, culturally-appropriate development activities around the world. While critics maintain that DoD does not provide aid equitably and without regard to political influence, the Asian tsunami of December, 2004 (due to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]) demonstrated that DoD was capable of working in a supporting role without regard to geopolitical gain. Indeed, the DoD was surprised at the unexpected degree of improvement in American prestige as a result of its role in Southeast Asia and months later, in the Pakistan earthquake. A similar event resulted in rapid mobilization of DoD resources in response to the [[2007 Peru earthquake]], Bangladeshi [[Typhoon]] Sidr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/28/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Cyclone.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=|date=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tropical Storm]] Nero in the [[Dominican Republic]], all in the last half of 2007, with no reasonable expectation of material gain for America.

In 2005, then-Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] signed DoD Directive 3000.05, "Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction Operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300005p.pdf|title=Directives Division|website=www.dtic.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document requires the DoD to assign Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction (SSTR) the same importance in planning and preparation as it gives to warfighting.

The rationale for SSTR is intuitive: stability promotes rule of law and economic development. These provide the base for essential services such as education, [[public health]] and [[sanitation]], law enforcement and fire suppression. Essential services, in turn, lead to increased stability and economic opportunity. Health in the general population, and in particular the labor force, is essential to productivity and consequent stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr11/en/|title=WHO - World Health Day 2007: International Health Security|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these relationships are not necessarily linear, and there is no inherent guarantee of equitable distribution of wealth in a developing society, full employment and hope for the future may be powerful disincentives to conflict. In this way, the DoD, through SSTR operations, expects to prevent some potential conflicts and criminal activities.

The International Health Division, charged with policy implications of DoDD 3000.05, is located within the Office of the ASD(HA), reporting through Force Health Protection &amp; Readiness. International Health develops DoD's policy on [[medical ethics]] and the practice of medicine in international health and development settings. International Health also identifies needs in developing nations and looks for [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), intergovernmental organizations, and private voluntary organizations (PVOs) such as professional societies, that have the ability and expertise to address these problems. In this way, the NGOs develop helping relationships with the nations or regions they work in, fostering stability and sustainability.

Other DoD international health activities occurring on a regular basis include [[Civic action program|medical civic action projects]] (MEDCAPs), in which Army, Navy or Air Force medical assets provide direct care, sanitation, and other public health services to host nation (HN) locals. Such MEDCAPs are generally traced to the [[Vietnam war]], when medical units and medical personnel assigned to combat units would organize field medical care to Vietnamese, [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and others. There is a growing realization among the military that MEDCAP care may not be the best model, if the result is merely handing out antibiotics for upper respiratory infections and anti-inflammatories for aches and pains. However, projects such as de-worming, dentistry, prenatal education and care, and veterinary care, when performed in conjunction with HN health authorities and the local health infrastructure, have indisputable and long-lasting benefits to the recipients.

Similar to MEDCAPs, the military performs [[Civic action program|Medical Readiness Training Exercises]] (MEDRETEs), [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] (JCET), and Humanitarian-Civic Action (HCA) exercises, all of which may have direct and indirect services as a feature of the training.

Finally, the military has unparalleled logistical and lift capabilities to respond to humanitarian assistance/disaster response(HADR) needs.

In conjunction with the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] (USUHS), the  [http://www.cdham.org/ Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Medicine (CDHAM)] develops curriculum, teaches disaster and humanitarian assistance principles to graduate, medical, and post-doctoral students and publishes courses on incident command and other related topics. The handbook on military-NGO relations, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101110012445/http://fhp.osd.mil/intlhealth/pdfs/ngo_guidebook_S1.pdf "A Guide to Non-Governmental Organizations for the Military"] is available free on-line.

==The American College of Academic International Medicine==

Among more recent developments in the area, the formation of the [[American College of Academic International Medicine]] (ACAIM) provided a renewed impetus toward the consolidation and formalization of U.S. based coordination of [[Academic International Medicine]] (AIM) efforts across the multiple currently existing platforms [http://acaim.org//]. Since its inception, ACAIM galvanized the U.S. AIM community to action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijam-web.org/article.asp?issn=2455-5568;year=2016;volume=2;issue=2;spage=121;epage=126;aulast=Anderson|title=Mission statement for the American College of Academic International Medicine: Empowering individuals, nurturing wellness, promoting excellence, stimulating minds, striving for sustainability, and celebrating inclusion|publisher=MedKnow|date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the need for the formation of cross-disciplinary, bi-directional [[International Medical Programs]] (IMPs) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386255_A_Comprehensive_Framework_for_International_Medical_Programs_A_2017_consensus_statement_from_the_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine|title=A Comprehensive Framework for International Medical Programs: A 2017 consensus statement from the American College of Academic International Medicine|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that foster the sustainable development of AIM efforts while minimizing the deleterious effects of brain drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijam-web.org/article.asp?issn=2455-5568;year=2016;volume=2;issue=1;spage=68;epage=77;aulast=Wernick|title=Brain drain in academic medicine: Dealing with personnel departures and loss of talent|publisher=MedKnow|date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another novel and unique aspect of [[ACAIM]]'s overall mission and postulate is the need for healthcare institutions, both academic and non-academic, to recognize faculty efforts dedicated to [[International Medical Program]] development as valid expressions of academic contribution that should be granted credit equivalence with U.S. based medical outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386174_The_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine_2017_Consensus_Statement_on_International_Medical_Programs_Establishing_a_system_of_objective_valuation_and_quantitative_metrics_to_facilitate_t|title=The American College of Academic International Medicine 2017 Consensus Statement on International Medical Programs: Establishing a system of objective valuation and quantitative metrics to facilitate the recognition and incorporation of academic international medical efforts into existing promotion and tenure paradigms|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within such proposed framework, faculty members would receive [[academic RVU]] based credit for international work, with academic tracks formally recognizing [[International Medical Program]] contributions as equivalent to any other academic or educational work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386174_The_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine_2017_Consensus_Statement_on_International_Medical_Programs_Establishing_a_system_of_objective_valuation_and_quantitative_metrics_to_facilitate_t|title=The American College of Academic International Medicine 2017 Consensus Statement on International Medical Programs: Establishing a system of objective valuation and quantitative metrics to facilitate the recognition and incorporation of academic international medical efforts into existing promotion and tenure paradigms|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the "'''largest [[naval battle]] in history'''" is disputed between adherents of different criteria which include the numbers of personnel and/or vessels involved in the battle, and the total tonnage of the vessels involved. While battles fought in modern times are comparatively well-documented, the figures from those in pre-Renaissance times are generally believed to be exaggerated by contemporary chroniclers.

==The candidates==
* '''[[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]]''', September (28?) 480 BC. 371 [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ships defeated 300–600 [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] ships in this decisive battle. Greek [[trireme]]s had a crew of about 200 while their small [[Penteconter (ship)|penteconters]] had 50 oarsmen.
* '''[[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Cape Ecnomus]]''', 256 BC. One of [[Roman Republic|Rome's]] first major naval victories over its rival, the city of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], in the [[First Punic War]]. The battle itself involved around 680 ships and 300,000 personnel from both sides. Total casualties were about 40,000–50,000, of which roughly 10,000 were on the Roman side and the rest from the Carthaginian side.
*'''[[Battle of Red Cliffs|Red Cliffs]]''', winter of 208 AD. A decisive naval engagement between the forces of [[Cao Cao]] and the allied forces of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], this battle resulted in the defeat of Cao Cao and confirmed the separation of China into northern and southern halves, the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze River Valley]] as a border. Between 270,000 and 850,000 personnel participated in this battle.
*'''[[Battle of the Masts]]''', 654 AD. The Battle of the Masts, or the Battle of [[Finike]] (Phoenix), was an engagement involving the [[Byzantine Empire]], with 500 ships and led personally by Emperor [[Constans II]], and the newly formed navy of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], commanded by Admiral [[Abu'l-Awar]], with 200 ships. The Byzantines hastily attacked, resulting in a decisive victory for the Arabs. Emperor Constans II barely escaped with his life, and this battle marked the emergence of Arabs on the Mediterranean. 
* '''[[Battle of Yamen|Yamen]]''', March 19, 1279. The battle which ended the Mongol-led [[Yuan Dynasty]]'s conquest of [[Southern Song Dynasty]]. It is claimed that more than 1,000 [[Song Dynasty]] warships were destroyed by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] near Yamen, [[Guangdong]], China.
*  '''[[Battle of Lake Poyang|Lake Poyang]]''', August 30&amp;ndash;October 4, 1363. Claimed to be the largest naval battle in terms of personnel, with a reported 850,000 sailors and soldiers involved. A [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] rebel force, said to be 200,000 strong, commanded by [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], met a [[Han (people)|Han]] rebel force, claimed to be 650,000-strong, commanded by [[Chen Youliang]], on [[Lake Poyang]], China's largest freshwater lake.
* '''[[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]''', May 31&amp;ndash;June 1, 1916. The Imperial German Navy's [[High Seas Fleet]] commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and the British [[Grand Fleet]] under [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Sir John Jellicoe]] engaged in battle near Jutland, Denmark during World War I. The German fleet consisted of 16 [[dreadnought]] and 6 [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships, 5 [[Battlecruiser|battle cruisers]], 11 [[light cruiser]]s, and 61 fleet torpedo boats, while the numerically superior British fleet was composed of 28 battleships, 9 battle cruisers, 8 [[Armored cruiser|armoured cruisers]], 26 light cruisers, 78 destroyers, 1 [[minelayer]], and 1 [[Seaplane tender|seaplane carrier]]. Britain lost more ships and twice as many men as Germany, although ultimately the outcome was beneficial for the British as the battle resulted in the successful containment of the German fleet. In terms of total tonnage of ships involved, this was the largest surface battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Largest Naval Sea Battles in Military History|url=http://militaryhistory.norwich.edu/largest-naval-sea-battles-in-military-history/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]]''', June 19–20, 1944. The largest aircraft carrier battle in history, involving fifteen U.S. [[Fleet carrier|fleet]] and [[Light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine Japanese carriers, 170 other warships and some 1,700 aircraft.  In terms of tonnage, the U.S. Fifth Fleet's [[Task Force 58]] is the largest single naval formation ever to give battle.
* '''[[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]]''', October 23&amp;ndash;26, 1944. The largest in terms of [[tonnage]] of ships in the combined orders of battle, if not necessarily in terms of tonnage of the ships engaged; it is also the largest in terms of the tonnage of ships sunk, and in terms of the size of the area within which the component battles took place. The [[United States]] [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third]] and [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh]] Fleets, including some [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] warships, comprised 8 large [[aircraft carrier]]s, 8 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], 18 [[escort carrier]]s, 12 [[Battleship#World War II|battleship]]s, 24 [[cruiser]]s, 141 [[destroyer]]s and [[destroyer escort]]s, many other ships, and around 1,500 aircraft. They won a decisive victory over [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces, which consisted of 1 large [[aircraft carrier]], 3 [[light aircraft carrier|light carriers]], nine battleships, 19 cruisers, 34 destroyers and several hundred aircraft. The opposing fleets carried a total of about 200,000 personnel. Leyte Gulf consisted of four major subsidiary battles: [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]], [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]], [[Battle of Samar]] and [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Cape Engaño (25–26 October)|Battle of Cape Engano]], along with other actions. These are counted together by virtue of their all being caused by the Japanese operation ''Sho-Go'', which was aimed at destroying the Allied amphibious forces involved in the [[Battle of Leyte|invasion of Leyte]]. However, the individual battles were separated by distances as great as two hundred miles, as well as several days time, from the first submarine action to the Japanese withdrawal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">There have been several claims for the '''longest sentence in the [[English language]]''', usually with claims that revolve around the longest ''printed'' sentence, because there is no limit on the possible length of a written English sentence. 

At least one [[linguistics]] textbook concludes that, in theory, "there is no longest English sentence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-262-73125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sentence can be made arbitrarily long by successive iterations, such as 
''Someone thinks that someone thinks that someone thinks that...,''&lt;ref name="Crain"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-631-19536-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by combining shorter [[clause]]s in various ways. 

For example, sentences can be extended by recursively embedding clauses one into another, such as &lt;ref&gt;Morten H Christiansen, Nick Chater, ''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog2302_2/epdf Toward a Connectionist Model of Recursion in Human Linguistic Performance]'', ''Cognitive Science'', vol. 23, issue 2, 1999, {{doi|10.1207/s15516709cog2302_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite book

:''The mouse ran away''
:''The mouse that the cat bit ran away''
:...
:''The mouse that the cat that the dog that the man frightened chased bit ran away''

The ability to embed structures within larger ones is called [[recursion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carnie |first=Andrew |page=33 |title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction |edition=third |year=2013 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Singapore&lt;!-- among others--&gt; |isbn=978-0-470-65531-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=or-Y3c9dY4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also highlights the difference between [[linguistic performance]] and [[linguistic competence]], because the language can support more variation than can reasonably be created or recorded.&lt;ref name="Crain"/&gt;

==Exceptionally long sentences in print==

One of the longest sentences in literature is contained in [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). The sentence is composed of 1,288 words (In the 1951 Random House version).&lt;ref name=rebecca/&gt;

Another sentence that is often claimed to be the longest sentence ever written is Molly Bloom's soliloquy in the [[James Joyce]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922),  which contains a sentence of 3,687 words.&lt;ref name=rebecca/&gt; However, this sentence is simply many sentences without punctuation.

[[Jonathan Coe]]'s ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'' appears to hold the record at 13,955 words.&lt;ref name=rebecca&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Rebecca |date=3 October 2014 |title=Longest Sentence |work=Today |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/arts/sentence.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by [[Bohumil Hrabal]]'s ''[[Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age]]'': a [[Czech language]] novel written in one long sentence.

[[File:Flag of the Nordic Council.svg|thumb|Flag before 2016]]
The '''Nordic Council''' is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary co-operation among the [[Nordic countries]]. Formed in 1952, it has 87 representatives from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]] as well as from the autonomous areas of the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Åland Islands]]. The representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year with a specific theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an [[intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental]] forum, was established to complement the Council. The official and working languages of both the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, which comprise the first language of around 80% of the region's population and learned as a foreign language by the remaining 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/language|title=Language|date=2008-08-06|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas, amongst them being the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague|title=Ratas meets with Benelux, Nordic, Baltic leaders in the Hague|last=ERR|date=2017-06-22|work=ERR|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During World War II, [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] were occupied by [[Germany]]; [[Finland]] was [[Winter War|under assault]] by the [[Soviet Union]]; while [[Sweden]], though neutral, still felt the war's effects. Following the war, the [[Nordic countries]] pursued the idea of a [[Scandinavian defence union]] to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland, due to its [[Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine|Paasikivi-Kekkonen policy of neutrality]] and [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|FCMA treaty]] with the USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with [[NATO]], which some were planning at the time. The [[United States]], keen on getting access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and Iceland joining NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.lu/plan_scandinavian_defence_union-2-6834 The plan for a Scandinavian Defence Union], [[European Navigator]].

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed. This led [[Danish Prime Minister]] [[Hans Hedtoft]] to propose, in 1951, a consultative inter-parliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 1952.&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/before-1952 Before 1952], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13 February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-Soviet relations thawed following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Finland joined the council in 1955.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/the-history-of-the-nordic-council/1953-1971 1953–1971 Finland joins in and the first Nordic rights are formulated.], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the [[Nordic Passport Union]] was created. These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There were also plans for a [[single market]] but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway applied to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The Treaty of Helsinki outlined the workings of the Council and came into force on 24 March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and Nordic House in [[Reykjavík]] were created. Danish Prime Minister [[Hilmar Baunsgaard]] proposed full economic cooperation ("[[Nordek]]") in 1968. Nordek was agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway).&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic cooperation.&lt;ref name="HM1"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 The period up to 1971] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111240/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/the-period-up-to-1971 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 representatives of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Åland Islands|Åland]] were allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish delegations.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt; Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics.&lt;ref name="HM2"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 1972–1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120111152/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/197220131989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, although it did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on, although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more active role in [[Arctic cooperation and politics|circumpolar]] affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the [[Nordic Industrial Fund]], Nordtest and the [[Nordic Investment Bank]]. The Council's remit was also expanded to include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], a joint energy network was established. The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983&lt;ref name="HM2"/&gt; and, in 1984, representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.&lt;ref name="H2"/&gt;

Following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Nordic Council began to cooperate more with the [[Baltic states]] and new Baltic Sea organisations. Sweden and Finland joined the [[European Union]] (EU), the EEC's successor, in 1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.&lt;ref name="HM3"&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 After 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120103903/http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers/history-of-the-nordic-council-of-ministers/after-1989 |date=20 November 2011 }}, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt; However, Norway and Iceland did join the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) which integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also subsumed into the EU's [[Schengen Area]] in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the [[Arctic]], Baltic, Europe, and [[Canada]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce barriers.&lt;ref name="HM3"/&gt; However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began [[Accession of Iceland to the European Union|EU membership talks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/11/03/further-icelandic-support-for-eu-membership/#more-4118 |title=Further Icelandic support for EU membership &amp;#124; IceNews – Daily News |publisher=Icenews.is |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but decided to annul these in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/iceland-drops-european-union-membership-bid |title=Iceland drops EU membership bid: 'interests better served outside' union |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
===Language understanding===

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus on strengthening the [[North Germanic languages|Nordic language]] community; the main focus of their work to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.comingsoon.no/en/theme/education-and-research-in-the-nordic-region/language Language co-operation], Nordic Council&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of the Council have the ability to issue proposals in their own languages, and official documents are translated to cater to all five of the major Nordic languages. Discussions for bringing Finnish and Icelandic into equal footing with the three other languages has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.norden.org/fi/ajankohtaista/uutiset/suomen-ja-islannin-kielen-asemaa-parannetaan-pohjoismaisessa-yhteistyoessae|title=Suomen ja islannin kielen asemaa parannetaan pohjoismaisessa yhteistyössä|date=2017-11-02|access-date=2018-06-01|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Council ===
The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members' parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a so-called "theme session" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous territories{{spaced ndash}}Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Åland{{spaced ndash}}also have Nordic secretariats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/the-nordic-council/about-the-nordic-council About the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council uses the three Continental [[Scandinavian languages]] ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) as its official working languages, but also publishes material in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[English language|English]] for information purposes. The council refers to Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be different forms of the same language forming a common language community.&lt;ref name="Norden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/ |title=Norden |date=11 September 2009 |work=Norden |publisher=Norden.org |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1987, under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to hospitals, job centres, the police and social security offices. The languages included are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428022430/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6795&amp;lang=6|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With Denmark, Norway, and Iceland being members of NATO and Finland and Sweden being [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]], the Nordic Council has not been involved in any military cooperation.

===Council of Ministers===
The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation. [http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers The ''Nordic Council of Ministers''], founded in 1971, is responsible for inter-governmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which co-ordinates the day-to-day work. The autonomous territories have the same representation as states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/the-nordic-council-of-ministers The Nordic Council of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secretary General ===
*[[Secretary-General of the Nordic Council]]

== Location ==
[[File:Norden Copenhagen.JPG|thumb|Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18]]
The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in [[Copenhagen]] and various installations in each separate country, as well as many offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at [[Ved Stranden]] No. 18, close to [[Slotsholmen]].

== Members ==
&lt;!-- Do NOT add alleged "observers" to this section. First of all, this is a section on MEMBERS, not observers, which are two different things. Cooperation with the Baltic states belongs in the next section on such cooperation. Secondly, it has been established that the Nordic Council has no official observer status (Talk:Nordic countries). As sessions are open to the public, anyone may be present and "observe" the proceedings, but that doesn't make them "observer members" in a formal sense, like at the UN, where observer status gives many formal rights. As this article already discusses, observer status for the Baltic states was explicitly rejected, and there is no evidence presented that the council has made any other decision in this matter since (more on this on Talk:Nordic countries, where the matter was debated to death) --&gt;

The Nordic Council has 8 members, 5 sovereign states and 3 self-governing regions.

==Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and regions==

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the [[Sámi Parliamentary Council]] is the only institution with observer status with the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the status of "guest" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium "may invite representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and grant them speaking rights" as guests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/bag-om-nordisk-raad/the-nordic-council/rules-of-procedure-for-the-nordic-council Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the council, "within the last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are invited to the Theme Session."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council/sessions-and-meetings/nordic-council-sessions/about-the-sessions-of-the-nordic-council About the Sessions of the Nordic Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four ''Offices outside the Nordic Region'', namely in all the [[Baltic states]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]&amp;nbsp;– and the German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/om-samarbejdet-1/organisations-and-institutions/offices-outside-the-nordic-region Offices outside the Nordic Region]. Nordic Council of Ministers.&lt;/ref&gt; The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies within the Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;''Planer och budget 2016'', p. 71, Nordic Council of Ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers define [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]] as "Adjacent Areas" and has formal cooperation with them under the Adjacent Areas policies framework; in recent years the cooperation has focused increasingly on Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Etzold, "Nordic Institutionalized Cooperation in a Larger Regional Setting," in Johan Strang (ed.), ''Nordic Cooperation: A European Region in Transition'', pp. 148ff, Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317626954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was heavily opposed by the [[Soviet Union]], accusing the Nordic Council of getting involved in its internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsuxRJH&amp;sig=CzVoYbflgNMAIdhyDNtWfiDdtk0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=sMUW5PR1FI8C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=estonia+nordic+council+observer+1991&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wySUsvpPKI&amp;sig=vVIg3P4gkhs6kJnW-goho8laWeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi53MbMjK3WAhVHQJoKHW_QDmkQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20nordic%20council%20observer%201991&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Nordic Council refused to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=OMFdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=estonia+%22nordic+council%22+%22observer+status%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6PVUeUqmHs&amp;sig=cRt4I8tK-gjmM2hSIgRRlK2FyTc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK4KXtha3WAhUECZoKHTlSBmwQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=estonia%20%22nordic%20council%22%20%22observer%20status%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border cooperation with Denmark and has a [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html Schleswig-Holstein for the first time uses its observer status in the Nordic Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117110624/http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/aktuell/panorama_berichte/16_11_01_nordischer_rat.html |date=17 November 2016 }} (in German), Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the [[South Schleswig Voter Federation]] and a member of the [[Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands|Social Democrats]] with ties to the Danish minority were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.ltsh.de/infothek/wahl18/drucks/4800/drucksache-18-4839.pdf Election of observational members to the Nordic Council], Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein, 3 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sami people|Sámi]] political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In addition, the [[Faroe Islands]] have expressed their wishes for full membership in the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norden.org/en/news-and-events/news/the-faroe-islands-apply-for-membership-in-the-nordic-council-and-nordic-council-of-ministers-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently{{When|date=March 2018}}, three of the members of the Nordic Council ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]], all [[Member state of the European Union|EU-member states]]), the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Benelux]] sought intensifying cooperation in the [[Digital Single Market]], as well as discussing social matters, the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]], the [[European migrant crisis]] and defense cooperation. Relations with [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|Turkey]] and the [[Brexit|United Kingdom]] was also on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.err.ee/603573/ratas-meets-with-benelux-nordic-baltic-leaders-in-the-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nordic unification ==
{{further|Scandinavism}}
 
Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico or South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Wetterberg, Gunnar (3 November 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/31188 Comment The United Nordic Federation], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our World In Data''' (OWID) is an [[Electronic publishing|online publication]] that presents empirical research and data that show how [[living conditions]] around the world are changing.  The web publication on [[International development|global development]] uses interactive [[Data visualization|data visualisations]] (charts and maps) to present the research findings on development that explain the causes and consequences of the observed changes.  The aim is to show how the world is changing and why.

The publication is developed at the [[University of Oxford]] and authored by social [[historian]] and development economist [[Max Roser]]. It covers a wide range of topics across many academic disciplines: Trends in [[health]], [[Hunger|food provision]], the [[Economic growth|growth]] and [[Economic inequality|distribution of incomes]], [[violence]], [[Human rights|rights]], [[war]]s, [[culture]], [[energy use]], [[education]], and [[environmental change]]s are empirically analysed and visualised in this web publication.

Covering all of these aspects in one resource makes it possible to understand how the observed long-run trends are interlinked. The research on global development is presented to the audience of interested readers, journalists, academics, and policy people. The articles cross-reference each other to make it possible for the reader to learn about the drivers of the observed long-run trends. For each topic the quality of the data is discussed and, by pointing the visitor to the sources, this website works as a database of databases – a meta-database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ourworldindata.org/about/|title=About — Our World in Data|website=ourworldindata.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oxalis corniculata''''', the '''creeping woodsorrel''', also called '''procumbent yellow sorrel'''&lt;ref name=BSBI07&gt;{{cite web |title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archive-date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''sleeping beauty''', resembles the common yellow woodsorrel, ''[[Oxalis stricta]]''. It is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing, [[herb]]aceous [[plant]] in the family [[Oxalidaceae]]. It has a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the [[node (botany)|node]]s. The trifoliate [[Leaf|leaves]] are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a [[clover]] in shape. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, like ''Oxalis corniculata'' var. ''atropurpurea'', have purple. The leaves have inconspicuous [[stipule]]s at the base of each [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]].

The [[fruit]] is a narrow, cylindrical [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]], {{cvt|1|-|2|cm|1}} long, and noteworthy for its [[Seed dispersal#Explosive action|explosive discharge]] of the contained seeds, {{cvt|1|mm|2}} long.

==Distribution==
This species is [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] in its distribution, and its place of origin is unknown, but it is considered an [[Old World]] plant. It is regarded as a [[weed]] in [[garden]]s,&lt;ref name=Hackney92&gt;Hackney, P. 1992. ''Stewart &amp; Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland.'' Institute of Irish Studies, Queen's University of Belfast.&lt;/ref&gt; agricultural fields, and [[lawn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7444.html UC Davis IPM]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The leaves of woodsorrel are quite edible, with a tangy taste of [[lemons]]. A drink can be made by [[infusion|infusing]] the leaves in hot water for about 10 minutes, sweetening and then chilling.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Lee Allen Peterson, ''Edible Wild Plants'', Houghton Mifflin Company, New York City (1977), p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire plant is rich in [[vitamin C]]. Any woodsorrel is safe in low dosages, but if eaten in large quantities over a length of time can inhibit [[calcium]] absorption by the body.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;

[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|[[1918 flu pandemic|The 1918–1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic]] resulted in dramatic mortality worldwide.]]

A '''pandemic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' "all" and δῆμος ''demos'' "people") is an [[epidemic]] of [[infectious disease]] that has spread across a large region; for instance multiple [[continents]], or even worldwide.

A widespread [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease that is stable in terms of how many people are getting sick from it is not a pandemic. Further, [[Influenza pandemic|flu pandemics]] generally exclude recurrences of [[seasonal flu]]. Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as [[smallpox]] and [[tuberculosis]]. One of the most devastating pandemics was the [[Black Death]], which killed over 75 million people in 1350. The most recent pandemics include the [[HIV]] pandemic as well as the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]]  and [[2009 flu pandemic|2009]] [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] pandemics.

== Definition and stages ==

[[File:Pandemie.jpg|thumb|left|Advice (in French and English) for travellers on risks of epidemics abroad. Posters from the Charles De Gaulle airport, Paris, 2016.]]
A pandemic is an [[epidemic]] occurring on a scale which crosses international boundaries, usually affecting a large number of people.&lt;ref name=Porta2008&gt;{{cite book|author=Miquel Porta|editor=Miquel Porta|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=3 July 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531449-6|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemics can also occur in important agricultural organisms (livestock, crop plants, fish, tree species) or in other organisms.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has a six-stage classification that describes the process by which a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control until we stop it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ "Current WHO phase of pandemic alert"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928032422/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, World Health Organization 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For instance, [[cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=A. M.|first1=Dumar|title=Swine Flu: What You Need to Know|date=2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781434458322|page=7|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a virtual press conference in May 2009 on the influenza pandemic, Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General ''ad interim'' for Health Security and Environment, WHO said "An easy way to think about pandemic … is to say: a pandemic is a global outbreak. Then you might ask yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/influenzaAH1N1_presstranscript_20090526.pdf |title=WHO press conference on 2009 pandemic influenza |format=PDF |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled ''WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase''. The 2009 revision, including definitions of a pandemic and the phases leading to its declaration, were finalized in February 2009. The pandemic H1N1 2009 virus was neither on the horizon at that time nor mentioned in the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|title=Pandemic influenza preparedness and response|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194204/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/PIPGuidance09.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions of this document refer to influenza.

== Pandemics and notable epidemics through history ==
{{See also|List of epidemics|Columbian Exchange|Globalization and disease}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[zoonosis|zoonoses]] which came about with [[domestication]] of animals, such as [[influenza]] and tuberculosis. There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the "mere" destruction of cities:
* [[Plague of Athens]], 430 BC. Possibly [[typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003 "Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid"].

* [[Antonine Plague]], 165–180 AD.

* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, was the first recorded outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. It started in [[Egypt]], and reached [[Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height, and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[human population]] that it struck throughout the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=fro |title=Cambridge Catalogue page "Plague and the End of Antiquity" |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book "Plague and the End of Antiquity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114235/http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Lester K.

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed part of the native population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century ([[Guanches]]). Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by smallpox.

=== Typhus ===
[[Typhus]] is sometimes called "camp fever" because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as "gaol fever" and "ship fever", for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489, in Spain. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 soldiers died of typhus while fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), about 8 million Germans were killed by bubonic plague and typhus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME.'' April 29, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; The disease also played a major role in the destruction of [[Napoleon]]'s ''[[La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' in Russia in 1812. During the retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of [[typhus]] than were killed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611213940/http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}.

=== Measles ===
Historically, [[measles]] was prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the U.S. [[National Immunization Program]], 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were an estimated 3–4 million
cases in the U.S. each year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Center for Disease Control &amp; National Immunization Program. Measles History, article online 2001.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people develop resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to a new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Microbes: Disease and Plagues in History and Modern Times''; by [[Arno Karlen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The disease had ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART "Measles and Small Pox as an Allied Army of the Conquistadors of America"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502200745/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/RUVALCA1.ART |date=2009-05-02 }} by Carlos Ruvalcaba, translated by Theresa M.

Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as "[[Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s", may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm Researchers sound the alarm: the multidrug resistance of the plague bacillus could spread] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014012153/http://www.pasteur.fr/actu/presse/press/07pesteTIGR_E.htm |date=2007-10-14 }}. Pasteur.fr&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cases of tuberculosis that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]. ''World Health Organization.''&lt;/ref&gt; China and India have the highest rate of multidrug-resistant TB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/01/bill-gates-tb-timebomb-china Bill Gates joins Chinese government in tackling TB 'timebomb']. ''Guardian.co.uk''. April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with MDR TB, with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States. There are about 40,000 new cases of XDR-TB per year, the WHO estimates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/tb.pandemic/index.html Tuberculosis: A new pandemic?]. CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[antibiotics]] such as [[vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[aminoglycosides]] and [[cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as "strongest"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed "broad spectrum". Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

=== SARS ===
In 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956–2003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated. It could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=== Influenza ===
{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally, viruses are transmitted from these species to other species, and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or, rarely, in humans.&lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir |author=Klenk|year=2008 |chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range |title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-22-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book |author=Kawaoka Y (editor). |title=Influenza Virology: Current Topics |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2006 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu |isbn=978-1-904455-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== H5N1 (Avian Flu) ====
{{Main|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1}}

In February 2004, [[avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=MacKenzie D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: "We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China." Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC NEWS |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC NEWS | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a "pandemic", because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006, there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2005). Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Infection in Humans http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra052211&lt;/ref&gt; Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients, and thus limiting person-to-person transmission.

=== Zika virus ===
{{Main|Zika virus outbreak in the Americas (2015–present)|Zika virus|Zika fever}}
An outbreak of [[Zika virus]] began in 2015 and strongly intensified throughout the start of 2016, with over 1.5 million cases across more than a dozen countries in [[the Americas]]. The World Health Organisation warned that Zika had the potential to become an explosive global pandemic if the outbreak was not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35425731|title=Zika virus could become 'explosive pandemic'|date=28 January 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic consequences of pandemic events ===
In 2016, the Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future estimated that pandemic disease events would cost the global economy over $6 trillion in the 21st century - over $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nam.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Neglected-Dimension-of-Global-Security.pdf|title=Global Health Risk Framework - The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises|last=|first=|date=2016-01-16|website=|publisher=National Academy of Medicine|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report also recommended spending $4.5 billion annually on global prevention and response capabilities to reduce the threat posed by pandemic events.

== Biological warfare ==
{{Further|Biological warfare}}
In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged [[Crimea]]n city of [[Caffa|Kaffa]] (now [[Feodosiya|Theodosia]]). After a protracted siege, during which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls to infect the inhabitants. It has been speculated that this operation may have been responsible for the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wheelis M |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–5 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12194776 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article |pmc=2732530 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population was devastated after contact with the [[Old World]] by introduction of many fatal diseases. In a well documented case of germ warfare involving British commander [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] and Swiss-British officer Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]], their correspondence included a proposal and agreement to give smallpox-infected blankets to Indians in order to "Extirpate this Execrable Race". During the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] late in the [[French and Indian War]], as recorded in his journal by sundries trader and militia Captain, [[William Trent]], on June 24, 1763, dignitaries from the Delaware tribe met with Fort Pitt officials, warned them of "great numbers of Indians" coming to attack the fort, and pleaded with them to leave the fort while there was still time. The commander of the fort refused to abandon the fort. Instead, the British gave as gifts two blankets, one silk handkerchief and one linen from the smallpox hospital to two Delaware Indian dignitaries.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A. [http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html Biological Warfare in Eighteenth-Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403033815/http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Biosecurity_course_folder/readings/fenn.html |date=2015-04-03 }}; The Journal of American History, Vol. 86, No. 4, March, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  A devastating smallpox epidemic plagued Native American tribes in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes area through 1763 and 1764, but the effectiveness of individual instances of biological warfare remains unknown. After extensive review of surviving documentary evidence, historian [[Francis Jennings]] concluded the attempt at biological warfare was "unquestionably effective at Fort Pitt";&lt;ref&gt;''Empire of Fortune''; Francis Jennings; W. W. Norton &amp; Company; 1988; Pgs. 447-8&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox after [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] killed 400,000–500,000 (possibly even up to 1.5 million) Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Native Americans of the Pontiac's War'', 245–250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Indian Chronology: Chronologies of the American Mosaic |date=June 2, 2011 |author=Phillip M.

During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), [[Unit 731]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted [[Japanese war crimes#Human experimentation and biological warfare|human experimentation]] on thousands, mostly Chinese. In military campaigns, the Japanese army used biological weapons on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Plague fleas, infected clothing, and infected supplies encased in bombs were dropped on various targets. The resulting [[cholera]], [[anthrax]], and plague were estimated to have killed around 400,000 Chinese civilians.

Diseases considered for or known to be used as a weapon include [[anthrax]], [[ebola]], [[Marburg virus]], plague, [[cholera]], [[typhus]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], [[tularemia]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[machupo]], [[Coccidioides mycosis]], [[Glanders]], [[Melioidosis]], [[Shigella]], [[Psittacosis]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese B encephalitis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and smallpox.&lt;ref name="Alibek"/&gt;

Spores of weaponized anthrax were accidentally released from a military facility near the Soviet [[closed city]] of [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1979. The [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] is sometimes called "biological [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]".&lt;ref name="Alibek"&gt;[[Ken Alibek]] and S. Handelman.

'''''Pathogens and Global Health''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] published by [[Maney Publishing]]. It covers [[tropical disease]]s, including their [[microbiology]], [[epidemiology]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as [[medical entomology]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Andrea Crisanti (scientist)|Andrea Crisanti]] ([[Imperial College London]]).

==History==
The journal was established by Sir [[Ronald Ross]] in 1906 as ''Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology'' to share the results of the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]]'s research and field expeditions. In May 2011, the journal was purchased by Maney Publishing, obtaining its current title in 2012, reflecting a broader focus including the [[biology]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], treatment, and control of [[pathogens]] of medical relevance beyond a regional definition.

Rise Against Hunger, [http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article129005999.html formerly Stop Hunger Now], is an international hunger relief non-profit organization that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food and other life-changing aid to people in developing nations. Founded in 1998, Rise Against Hunger mobilizes more than 350,000 volunteers each year to package meals for people in need around the globe. Since 2005, Rise Against Hunger has  distributed more than 315,000,000 meals to recipients in 74 countries with a mission to end hunger in our lifetime.
==History==

Rise Against Hunger is an international hunger relief agency that seeks to end global hunger by engaging local volunteers. The organization was formed in 1998 by Ray Buchanan, a United Methodist Minister, and began its meal packaging program in 2005. The organizational mission is stated as "Rise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Its mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources."

==Areas of Focus==
Rise Against Hunger aims to end hunger through four pathways: Nourishing Lives, Responding to Emergencies, Empowering Communities and Growing the Movement. From the implementation of sustainable development community projects to the meal packaging program that utilizes local volunteers, Rise Against Hunger strives to make a global impact on hunger by building resilience, self-sufficiency and empowerment among the world’s most vulnerable populations.   

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/nourishing-lives/ Nourishing Lives]===
Rise Against Hunger supports safety net programs that support nourishment and skills trainings that help the world’s most vulnerable navigate the difficult journey out of poverty. Rise Against Hunger partners with schools in order to promote and incentivize increased attendance. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger works to partner with skills trainings and clinics in order to support adults learning new trades and encourage healthy lifestyles. Rise Against Hunger works to nourish lives through a holistic approach in the development of the most vulnerable populations.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/responding-to-crisis/ Responding to Emergencies]===
Rise Against Hunger responds to emergencies. In times of floods, droughts or political unrest, to name a few, Rise Against Hunger aims to provide the immediate critical need, food. Access to food, wages and market systems are often destroyed in times of emergency. Rise Against Hunger works with its in-country partner organizations in order to address the immediate needs in the wake of crisis. Each year Rise Against Hunger reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond to crisis situations. Official Rise Against Hunger responses include the 2016 [[Hurricane Matthew]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syrian conflict]], [[South Sudanese Civil War|South Sudanese conflict]] and [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/our-impact/empowering-communities/ Empowering Communities]===
In order to create long-term solutions to hunger and poverty, Rise Against Hunger works to empower communities through agricultural and income-generating initiatives. Rise Against Hunger works to increase agriculture production and incomes through programs that promote improved agricultural methods, business skills and market access. Farmers, one of the most food insecure populations in the world, are given access to quality seeds and fertilizers to increase agricultural production and diversify their crops. Rise Against Hunger supports vocational training to help at-risk individuals increase their earning potentials and gain consistent access to food.

===[http://www.riseagainsthunger.org/get-involved/ Growing the Movement]===
Part of Rise Against Hunger’s mission is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. Rise Against Hunger works with volunteer groups from [http://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/local/hearing-the-call-ridgeview-baptist-fights-hunger/article_44250e2a-1cbd-11e7-b13c-db649d8b7886.html communities of faith], [http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Markets/Kraft-Heinz-expands-CSR-to-hunger-sustainability-environment corporations], [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/milestones-virginia-beach--year-old-organizes-fun-run-food/article_17c83b47-0fd8-5c61-b326-1d82310b7202.html schools] and [http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/news/20170320/local-rotary-clubs-pack-meals-for-rise-against-hunger civic clubs] to package meals while developing a greater awareness of hunger-related issues. Additionally, Rise Against Hunger engages its supporters to participate in advocacy activities to work toward changing laws, policies, systems and attitudes to end hunger by 2030.

==Meal packaging program==

The assembly process combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a micronutrient flavoring mix formulated by [http://www.heinz.com/sustainability/communities/heinz-micronutrient-campaign.aspx Kraft Heinz Company Foundation] that includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. The cost of each meal varies between 29 and 34 cents. The food has a shelf-life of two years.
Rise Against Hunger provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school lunch programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics. Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education, skills development, and healthcare while also receiving much needed nutrition.

==Grant program==

Rise Against Hunger supports partner organizations in developing countries by providing direct financial assistance to support ongoing programs that provide food, medicines or other basic necessities to impoverished populations. This program enables Rise Against Hunger to respond to crises immediately by working with organizations already on the ground. It also supports local economies in developing areas and promotes self-reliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Schøyen Collection''' is the largest private [[manuscript]] collection in the world, mostly located in [[Oslo]] and London. Formed in the 20th century by [[Martin Schøyen]], it comprises manuscripts of global [[provenance]], spanning 5,000 years of history.

There are manuscripts from 134 different countries and territories, representing 120 distinct languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/aboutus.html ''The Schøyen Collection'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of manuscripts—geographic, linguistic, textual and material—even more than its size makes the Schøyen Collection unique. The collection has a website with many items illustrated and described. The provenance of the various cuneiform materials held by the Schøyen Collection remains subject to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-04-21.html|title=Review of: The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, Critical Edition and Cuneiform Texts, 2 vols|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=BMCR|via=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13115">[[File:Bautzen-nach1620-Merian.jpg|thumb|The [[Thirty Years' War]] devastated much of Europe 1618–48 and was one of the many political upheavals during the General Crisis.]]
The '''General Crisis''' is the term used by some historians to describe the period of widespread conflict and instability that occurred from the early 17th century to the early 18th century in [[History of Europe|Europe]] and in more recent historiography in the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://sgtbkhalsadu.ac.in/colleges/tutorial/112718122009232906.113.5.pdf | title = Tutorial | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | publisher = Sgt Bkhalsadu | place = [[India|IN]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is much debated by historians and there is no consensus.

==What was the "General Crisis"?==
The term was coined by [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in his pair of 1954 articles entitled "The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century" published in ''Past and Present''. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

As a historiographic concept, the place of the general crisis was cemented by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], in a 1959 article entitled "The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century" published in the same journal. Hobsbawm discussed an economic crisis in Europe; Trevor-Roper saw a wider crisis, "a crisis in the relations between society and the State".{{Sfn | Aston | 1965 | p = 67}}  Trevor-Roper argued that the middle years of the 17th century in Western Europe saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by a complex series of demographic, religious, economic and political problems. In this "general crisis", various events such as the [[English Civil War]], the [[Fronde]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]], the climax of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and revolts against the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish Crown]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Naples]] and [[Catalonia]] were all manifestations of the same problem. The most important cause of the "general crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Kristen | contribution = Trevor-Roper, Hugh | title = The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing | pages = 1204–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in Trevor-Roper’s opinion, was the conflict between "Court" and "Country"; that is between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states represented by the court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry representing the country. In addition, the intellectual and religious changes introduced by the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]] were important secondary causes of the "general crisis".

There were various controversies regarding the "general crisis" thesis between historians.  Some simply denied the existence of any such crisis. For instance, Hobsbawm saw the problems of 17th-century Europe as being  social and economic in origin – an emphasis than Trevor-Roper would not concede.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

Subsequent historians interested in the General Crisis include [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], who has authored a book on the subject.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{Explain|date=July 2018}}

== Global patterns ==
Many historians have argued the 17th century was an era of crisis.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 1997}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}{{Sfn | Aston | 1965}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  Many other historians have rejected the idea.{{who |date=June 2015}} Today there are historians who promote the crisis model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JB | last = Shank | title = Crisis: A Useful Category of Post-Social Scientific Historical Analysis? | journal = American Historical Review | year = 2008 | volume = 113 | number = 4 | pages = 1090–99 | doi=10.1086/ahr.113.4.1090}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing it provides an invaluable insight into the warfare, politics, economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jan | last = de Vries | title = The Economic Crisis of the Seventeenth Century after Fifty Years | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | number = 2 | pages = 151–94 | jstor = 40263652 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2009.40.2.151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and even art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Burke | title = The Crisis in the Arts of the Seventeenth Century: A Crisis of Representation? | journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary History | year = 2009 | volume = 40 | number = 2 | pages = 239–61 | jstor = 40263655 | doi=10.1162/jinh.2009.40.2.239}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–48) focused attention on the massive horrors that wars could bring to entire populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter H | last = Wilson | title = The Thirty Years War: Europe’s Tragedy | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  The 1640s in particular saw more state breakdowns around the world than any previous or subsequent period.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 1997}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}{{Sfn | Aston | 1965}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the [[Spanish Empire]], the world’s first global empire.  In Britain the entire [[House of Stuart|Stuart monarchy]] ([[Kingdom of England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland]], [[Kingdom of Ireland]], and [[British America]]) rebelled.  Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equaled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia.  More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history.  The crises spread far beyond Europe—for example [[Ming China]], the most populous state in the world, collapsed.{{Sfn | Parker | 2008 | pp = 1053–79}}

China’s Ming dynasty and Japan’s [[Tokugawa shogunate]] had radically different economic, social, and political systems. However, they experienced a series of crises during the mid-17th century that were at once interrelated and strikingly similar to those occurring in other parts of the world at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William S | last = Atwell | title = Some Observations on the ‘Seventeenth-Century Crisis’ in China and Japan | journal = Journal of Asian Studies | year = 1986 | volume = 45 | number = 2 | pages = 223–44 | doi=10.2307/2055842}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frederic Wakeman]] argues that the crisis which destroyed the Ming dynasty was partly a result of the climatic change as well as China’s already significant involvement in the developing world economy.  Bureaucratic dishonesty worsened the problem.  Moreover, the [[Qing dynasty]]’s success in dealing with the crisis made it more difficult for it to consider alternative responses when confronted with severe challenges from the West in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frederic E | last = Wakeman | title = China and the Seventeenth-Century Crisis | journal = Late Imperial China | year = 1986 | volume = 7 | number = 1 | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1353/late.1986.0006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts and Wars ==
Examples which have been given for general crisis and state breakdown during this period include:
* The [[Thirty Years War]] in Germany (1618–48)
* The Economic Crisis in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1619–23)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/2123055 | title = JStor}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–51), [[The Protectorate]] (1653–59), and the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) in Britain and Ireland
* The collapse of the [[Ming Dynasty]] and rise of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China (1644–62)
* The [[Fronde]] in France (1643–68)
* Revolts against the [[Spain|Spanish crown]] in [[Naples]], [[Portugal]], and [[Catalonia]]
* The climax of the [[Dutch Revolt]] and related conflicts (ends in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]])
* Numerous internal revolts in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (especially 1622)
* The disintegration of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]
* The beginning of [[Sakoku]] in Japan and the [[Shimabara Uprising]] (1638)
* The [[Char Bouba War]] in [[Mauritania]] (1644–74)
* The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14)
* Several wars of succession in the [[Mughal Empire]] (1600-1605 between [[Akbar]] and [[Salim Nuruddin Jahangir|Salim]]; 1605; [[Shahjahan]]'s revolt)

==Inflation==
Precious metals from newly discovered deposits in [[United States|America]], especially silver from [[Potosí]] in modern [[Bolivia]] and from [[Mexico]], were shipped by [[Spain]] to [[China]] as well as to Europe.  Silver was less prevalent in China than in Europe and consequently more valuable.  The continuous flow of silver from the New World caused a continuous flow of wealth from China to Spain.  The silver imports also caused general price inflation throughout Europe.  Rapid population growth until the mid-decades of the seventeenth century also initially contributed to inflation in some areas.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}

== Demographic decline ==
For those who extend the General Crisis outside Europe, one symptom is dramatic population decline. For example, with the collapse of the [[Ming Dynasty]] the population of China fell by approximately 50 million between 1600 and 1644, a decrease of over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Germany's population was reduced by approximately 15% to 30% in the [[Thirty Years War]].&lt;ref name="TYW-1618-48-TWC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW |title=The Thirty Years War (1618–48) | work =Twentieth Century Atlas|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] also lost about a third of its population. Many theories have been proposed as to why population dropped so rapidly during this period.  Renowned economist Robert Malthus proposed the theory of population limitation as a result of carrying capacity. In his theory, food supplies simply did not grow as fast as population. As such, the subsistence gap between food and population created a check on the population.  In applying this theory to the demographic crisis of this period, much focus has been placed on the growth and expansion of the "new" monarchies of late medieval Europe.  These newly centralized and bureaucratized monarchies with their greater demands for war placed greater demands on the populaces of their realms. The previously mentioned climatic change also helped to exacerbate these new problems of war.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}

== Climate change ==
The General Crisis overlaps fairly neatly with the [[Little Ice Age]] which some authorities locate in the 17th century. Of particular interest is the overlap with the [[Maunder Minimum]].  Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker has suggested that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially the global cooling trend of this period.{{Sfn | Parker | Smith | 2008}}

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

'''Tropical diseases''' are [[Infectious disease|disease]]s that are prevalent in or unique to [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrar|first1=Jeremy|last2=Hotez|first2=Peter J|last3=Junghanss|first3=Thomas|last4=Kang|first4=Gagandeep|last5=Lalloo|first5=David|last6=White|first6=Nicholas|title=Manson's tropical diseases.|date=2013|publisher=Saunders [Imprint]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780702051012|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diseases are less prevalent in [[temperate climate]]s, due in part to the occurrence of a cold [[season]], which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th centuries before modern understanding of disease causation. The initial impetus for [[tropical medicine]] was to protect the health of colonialists, notably in India under the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farley|first1=John|title=Bilharzia : a history of imperial tropical medicine.|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0521530601|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals. Most often disease is transmitted by an insect "bite", which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.

Human exploration of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[deforestation]], rising [[immigration]] and increased international air travel and other [[tourism]] to tropical regions has led to an increased incidence of such diseases.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|title=Deforestation Boosts Malaria Rates, Study Finds|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103133648/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127962|archivedate=3 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm UK 'faces tropical disease threat'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615012659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1751188.stm |date=2006-06-15 }}, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health programmes ==
In 1975 the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) was established to focus on [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected infectious diseases]] which disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations in developing regions of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. It was established at the [[World Health Organization]], which is the executing agency, and is co-sponsored by the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Health Organization]].

TDR's vision is to foster an effective global research effort on infectious [[diseases of poverty]] in which disease endemic countries play a pivotal role. It has a dual mission of developing new tools and strategies against these diseases, and to develop the research and leadership capacity in the countries where the diseases occur. The TDR secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, but the work is conducted throughout the world through many partners and funded grants.

Some examples of work include helping to develop new treatments for diseases, such as ivermectin for onchocerciasis (river blindness); showing how packaging can improve use of artemesinin-combination treatment (ACT) for malaria; demonstrating the effectiveness of bednets to prevent mosquito bites and malaria; and documenting how community-based and community-led programmes increases distribution of multiple treatments.

* [[Chagas disease]]
*: (also called ''American trypanosomiasis'') is a [[parasitic disease]] which occurs in the [[Americas]], particularly in [[South America]]. Its [[pathogen]]ic agent is a [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]]n named ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', which is [[Vector (epidemiology)|transmitted]] mostly by [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] '''[[assassin bug]]s''', however other methods of transmission are possible, such as ingestion of food contaminated with [[parasite]]s, [[blood transfusion]] and [[fetus|fetal]] transmission. Between 16 and 18 million people are currently infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|title=Chagas Disease After Organ Transplantation --- United States, 2001|author=|date=|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013805/https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dengue]]
* [[Helminths]]
* [[African trypanosomiasis]]
*: or '''sleeping sickness''', is a [[parasitic]] [[disease]], caused by protozoa called trypansomes. The two responsible for African trypanosomiasis are Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.These parasites are transmitted by the '''[[tsetse fly]]'''
* [[Leishmaniasis]]
*: caused by [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s of the genus Leishmania, and transmitted by the bite of certain species of '''[[sand fly]]'''.
* [[Leprosy]]&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
*: (or '''Hansen's disease''') is a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[infectious disease]] caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae]]. Leprosy is primarily a [[granuloma]]tous disease of the [[peripheral nerves]] and [[mucosa]] of the [[upper respiratory tract]]; skin lesions are the primary external symptom.&lt;ref name= Sherris&gt;Kenneth J. Ryan and C. George Ray, Sherris Medical Microbiology Fourth Edition McGraw Hill 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes. Contrary to popular conception, leprosy does not cause body parts to simply fall off, and it differs from [[tzaraath]], the malady described in the Hebrew scriptures and previously translated into English as ''leprosy''.&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 13:59, Artscroll Tanakh and Metsudah Chumash translations, 1996 and 1994, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Filariasis|Lymphatic filariasis]]
*: is a [[parasite|parasitic]] disease caused by thread-like parasitic filarial worms called [[nematode]]s, all transmitted by '''[[mosquito]]es'''. [[Loa loa]] is another filarial parasite transmitted by the [[deer fly]]. 120 million people are infected worldwide. It is carried by over half the population in the most severe endemic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Supali, T. |author2=Ismid, I.S. |author3=Wibowo, H. |author4=Djuardi, Y. |author5=Majawati, E. |author6=Ginanjar, P. |author7=Fischer, P.  | title=Estimation of the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis by a pool screen PCR assay using blood spots collected on filter paper | journal=Tran R Soc Trop Med Hyg |date=Aug 2006 | volume=100 | issue=8 | pages=753&amp;ndash;9 | doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2005.10.005 | pmid=16442578  |issn=0035-9203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noticeable symptom is [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]]: a thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Elephantiasis is caused by chronic infection by filarial worms in the lymph nodes. This clogs the lymph nodes and slows the draining of lymph fluid from a portion of the body.
* [[Malaria]]
*: Caused by a [[Protozoan]] [[parasite]]s transmitted by female ''[[Anopheles]]'' [[mosquito]]es, as they are the blood-feeders. The disease is caused by species of the genus Plasmodium. Malaria infected an estimated 190-311 million people in 2008 and 708,000-1,003,000 died mostly in Sub-Sahara Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908032452/https://www.cdc.gov/Malaria/ |archivedate=2017-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tropical diseases are very rare, but may occur in sudden [[epidemic]]s, such as the [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever, [[Lassa fever]] and the [[Marburg virus]]. There are hundreds of different tropical diseases which are less known or rarer, but that, nonetheless, have importance for [[public health]].

==Relation of climate to tropical diseases==
The so-called "exotic" diseases in the tropics have long been noted both by travelers, explorers, etc., as well as by physicians. One obvious reason is that the hot climate present during all the year and the larger volume of [[rain]]s directly affect the formation of breeding grounds, the larger number and variety of [[natural reservoir]]s and animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans ([[zoonosis]]), the largest number of possible [[insect]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of diseases. It is possible also that higher temperatures may favor the replication of pathogenic agents both inside and outside biological organisms. Socio-economic factors may be also in operation, since most of the poorest nations of the world are in the tropics. Tropical countries like [[Brazil]], which have improved their socio-economic situation and invested in [[hygiene]], [[public health]] and the combat of transmissible diseases have achieved dramatic results in relation to the elimination or decrease of many [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] tropical diseases in their territory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[Climate change]], [[global warming]] caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], and the resulting increase in global [[temperature]]s, are possibly causing tropical diseases and vectors to spread to higher altitudes in mountainous regions, and to higher latitudes that were previously spared, such as the [[Southern United States]], the Mediterranean area, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange Climate change brings malaria back to Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305222344/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/06/italy.climatechange |date=2016-03-05 }} ''The Guardian'' 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm Climate link to African malaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173736/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4827362.stm |date=2006-06-16 }} 20 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica, global warming enabled Chytridiomycosis, a tropical disease, to flourish and thus force into decline amphibian populations of the Monteverde Harlequin frog.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, J. Alan et al. "Widespread Amphibian Extinctions from Epidemic Deisease Driven by Global Warming." Nature 439.12 (2006) 161-67&lt;/ref&gt; Here, global warming raised the heights of orographic cloud formation, and thus produced cloud cover that would facilitate optimum growth conditions for the implicated pathogen, B. dendrobatidis.

Some of the strategies for controlling tropical diseases include: 
* Draining wetlands to reduce populations of [[insect]]s and other [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s, or introducing natural predators of the vectors.
* The application of [[insecticide]]s and/or [[insect repellent]]s) to strategic surfaces such as clothing, skin, buildings, insect habitats, and [[bed net]]s.
* The use of a [[mosquito net]] over a bed (also known as a "bed net") to reduce nighttime transmission, since certain species of tropical [[mosquito]]es feed mainly at night.
* Use of water [[Water well|well]]s, and/or [[water filtration]], [[water filter]]s, or [[water treatment]] with water tablets to produce drinking water free of parasites.
* [[Sanitation]] to prevent transmission through human waste.
* In situations where vectors (such as mosquitoes) have become more numerous as a result of human activity, a careful investigation can provide clues: for example, open dumps can contain stagnant water that encourage disease vectors to breed. Eliminating these dumps can address the problem.  An education campaign can yield significant benefits at low cost.
* Development and use of [[vaccine]]s to promote disease [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].
* Pharmacologic pre-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease before exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic post-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent disease after exposure to the environment and/or vector).
* Pharmacologic treatment (to treat disease after infection or infestation).
* Assisting with economic development in endemic regions. For example, by providing [[microloan]]s to enable investments in more efficient and productive agriculture. This in turn can help [[subsistence farming]] to become more profitable, and these profits can be used by local populations for disease prevention and treatment, with the added benefit of reducing the poverty rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

'''World War I''' (often abbreviated as '''WWI''' or '''WW1'''), also known as the '''First World War''' or the '''Great War''', was a [[global war]] originating in [[Europe]] that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. Contemporaneously described as the "[[war to end all wars]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 November 1998 |title=The war to end all wars |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/world_war_i/198172.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; it led to the mobilisation of more than 70&amp;nbsp;million [[military personnel]], including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=8}}{{sfn |Bade |Brown |2003 |pp=167–168}} An estimated nine million [[combatants]] and seven million [[civilian]]s [[World War I casualties|died as a direct result of the war]], and it also contributed to [[Genocides in history#World War I through World War II|later genocides]] and the [[Spanish flu|1918 influenza pandemic]], which caused between 50 and 100 million deaths worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Rachel |title=Dual Threat: The Spanish Influenza and World War I |date=2014 |publisher=Trace: Tennessee Research and Creative Exchange |location=University of Tennessee Thesis |pages=4–10 |url=https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2761&amp;context=utk_chanhonoproj |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military losses were exacerbated by new technological and industrial developments and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling [[trench warfare]]. It was [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|one of the deadliest conflicts in history]] and precipitated major political changes, including the [[Revolutions of 1917–1923]], in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict [[Causes of World War II|contributed to the start of World War II]] about twenty years later.{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=307}}

On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serb]] [[Yugoslav nationalist]], [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], leading to the [[July Crisis]].&lt;ref name="AJPT2"&gt;{{harvnb |Taylor |1998 |pp=80–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Djokić |2003 |p=24}} In response, on 23 July Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. Serbia's reply failed to satisfy the Austrians, and the two moved to a war footing.

A network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the Balkans to one involving most of Europe. By 1914, the [[great powers]] of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the [[Triple Entente]]—consisting of [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[British Empire|Britain]]—and the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] (the Triple Alliance was primarily defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war in 1914).&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Diplomatic Background of the War |author=Charles Seymour |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=1916 |pages=35, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia felt it necessary to back Serbia, on 25 July issuing orders for the 'period preparatory to war', and after Austria-Hungary shelled the Serbian capital of [[Belgrade]] on the 28th, partial mobilisation was approved of the military districts nearest to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lieven |first1=Dominic |title=Towards the Flame: Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141399744 |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 July; on the 31st, Austria-Hungary and Germany did the same, while Germany demanded Russia demobilise within 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martel |first1=Gordon |title=The Month that Changed the World: July 1914 and WWI |date=2014 |publisher=OUP |location=6286 |edition=Kindle |ref=B00K79UOPK}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia failed to comply, Germany declared war on 1 August in support of Austria-Hungary, with Austria-Hungary following suit on 6th; France ordered full mobilisation in support of Russia on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Le Président de la République, R.

German strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within four weeks, then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilise; this was later known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zuber |first1=Terence |title=Inventing the Schlieffen Plan: German War Planning 1871–1914 |date=2011 |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0198718055 |pages=46–49 |edition=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August, Germany demanded [[German invasion of Belgium|free passage through Belgium]], an essential element in achieving a quick victory over France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Note Given 2 August 1914, at 19 hours, by M. de Below Saleske [Klaus von Below-Saleske], Minister of Germany, to M.

The war was fought in and drew upon each powers' colonial empires as well, spreading the conflict across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], while the grouping of Austria-Hungary and Germany would become known as the [[Central Powers]].

The German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] was marked by much greater exchanges of territory, but though [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbia was defeated in 1915]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the Allied Powers in 1916 [[Romania during World War I|only to be defeated in 1917]], none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers. After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by German submarines, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that the Germans were trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|US declared war on Germany]] on 6 April 1917.

The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent at the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]]. The offensive was initially successful, but the Allied Powers rallied and drove the Germans back in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice—the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918. On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the [[Armistice of Mudros]].&lt;ref name="indiana.edu-1918" /&gt; On 4 November, the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]]. With its allies defeated, [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolution]] at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] abdicated on 9 November and Germany also signed an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice on 11 November 1918]].

World War I was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. As a result of the war, the Russian Empire, the German Empire, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist. Revolutions and uprisings in the aftermath of the war became widespread, being mainly socialist or anti-colonial in nature. The [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] (Britain, France, the United States and Italy) imposed their terms in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The formation of the [[League of Nations]] was intended to prevent another [[world war]], but for various reasons failed to do so. The rise of the [[Nazi Party]] and their central role in [[World War II]] led to a focus on how the [[Treaty of Versailles]] affected Germany, but the peace treaties in addition to various secret agreements during the war also transformed borders throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with repercussions that still echo to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerwath |first1=Robert |title=The Vanquished: Why the First World War Failed to End, 1917–1923 |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |location=3323–3342 |isbn=978-0141976372 |edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "First World War" was first used in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]], who claimed that "there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'&amp;nbsp;... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,"{{sfn |Shapiro |Epstein |2006 |p=329}} citing a wire service report in ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'' on 20 September 1914.

Prior to [[World War II]], the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the '''Great War''' or simply the '''World War'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Were they always called World War I and World War II? |url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/were-they-always-called-world-war-i-and-world-war-ii |website=Ask History |accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Braybon |2004 |p=8}} Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as "[[the war to end war]]" or "the war to end all wars" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale and devastation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/world_war_i/198172.stm |title=The war to end all wars |publisher=BBC News |date=10 November 1998 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with British Empire historians, including Canadians, favouring "The First World War" and Americans "World War I".&lt;ref&gt;Margery Fee and Janice McAlpine. ''Guide to Canadian English Usage''. (Oxford UP, 1997), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1914, the Canadian magazine ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/81104 |title=great, adj., adv., and n |website=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while certainly accurate in Canada, this was not so even in Britain; historian [[John Holland Rose]]'s 1911 account of the 1793–1815 wars against France was titled ''William Pitt and the Great War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holland Rose |first1=John |title=William Pitt and the Great War |date=1911 |publisher=Amazon Media EU S.à r.l. |asin=B0082P4MSQ |edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was validated by Gareth Glover's 2015 book, ''Waterloo in 100 Objects'', in which he states: "This opening statement will cause some bewilderment to many who have grown up with the appellation of the Great War firmly applied to the 1914–18 First World War. But to anyone living before 1918, the title of the Great War was applied to the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] wars in which Britain fought France almost continuously for twenty-two years from 1793 to 1815."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glover |first1=Gareth |title=Waterloo in 100 Objects |date=2015 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7509-6289-6 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, "The Great War" was historically used for the 1618–1648 [[Thirty Years' War]], also known as the "Great German War" or "Great Schism". One of the longest and most destructive conflicts in human history, it resulted in eight million fatalities from military action, violence, famine and plague, the vast majority of them in the German states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Peter |title=Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War |date=2009 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-100614-7 |page=787 |edition=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction, it was only surpassed by the period from January to May 1945; its enduring visibility is partly the result of 19th-century [[Pan-Germanism]], as an example of the dangers of a divided Germany and a driver in the 1871 creation of the {{lang|de|Deutsches Kaiserreich}} or [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cramer |first1=Kevin |title=The Thirty Years' War and German Memory in the Nineteenth Century (Studies in War, Society, and the Military) |date=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-1562-7 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of terminology, the Thirty Years' War remains the single greatest war trauma in German memory, as demonstrated in debates over naming conventions during the centenary of 1914–1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 October 2014 |title=Der Dreißigjährige Krieg – die Urkatastrophe der deutschen Geschichte? |language=German |periodical=Der Teckbote |url=https://www.teckbote.de/datenschutz_artikel,-neidlingen-im-grossen-friedenswerk-von-1648-_arid,84911.html |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}

===Political and military alliances===
[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Map of Europe focusing on Austria-Hungary and marking central location of ethnic groups in it including Slovaks, Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ukrainians, Poles.|Rival military coalitions in 1914: [[Triple Entente]] in green; [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in brown. Only the Triple Alliance was a formal "alliance"; the others listed were informal patterns of support.]]

For much of the 19th century, the major European powers had tried to maintain a tenuous [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] among themselves, resulting in a complex network of political and military alliances.{{sfn |Clark |2014 |pp=121–152}} The biggest challenges to this were Britain's withdrawal into so-called [[splendid isolation]], the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] and the post-1848 rise of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] under [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Victory in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] established Prussian hegemony in Germany, while victory over France in the 1870–1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] [[Unification of Germany|unified]] the German states into a [[German Empire|German Reich]] under Prussian leadership.

In 1873, to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. Concerned by Russia's victory in the 1877–1878 [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War]] and their influence in the [[Balkans]], the League was dissolved in 1878, with Germany and Austria-Hungary subsequently forming the 1879 [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]; this became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] when Italy joined in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Willmott, [https://books.google.com/books/about/World_War_I.html?id=4hJgOQAACAAJ ''World War I''], Dorling Kindersley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Keegan |1998 |p=52}}

The practical details of these alliances were limited, since their primary purpose was to ensure cooperation between the three Imperial Powers and isolate France. Attempts by Britain in 1880 to resolve colonial tensions with Russia and diplomatic moves by France led to Bismarck reforming the League in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Medlicott |first1=W.N. |title=Bismarck and the Three Emperors' Alliance, 1881–87 |journal=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society |date=1945 |volume=27 |pages=66–70 |doi=10.2307/3678575 |jstor=3678575}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the League finally lapsed in 1887, it was replaced by the [[Reinsurance Treaty]], a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.

In 1890, the new German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], forced Bismarck to retire and was persuaded not to renew the Reinsurance Treaty by the new [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], [[Leo von Caprivi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keenan |first1=George |title=The Fateful Alliance: France, Russia and the Coming of the First World War |date=1986 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0719017070 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed France to counteract the Triple Alliance with the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894 and the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]] with Britain, while in 1907 Britain and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. The agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility; these interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the [[Triple Entente]].&lt;ref name=Willmott15&gt;{{harvnb |Willmott |2003 |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arms race===
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-23, Linienschiff "SMS Rheinland".jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|{{SMS|Rheinland}}, a {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}, Germany's first response to the British ''Dreadnought'']]

Victory in the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the creation of the [[German Empire|German Reich]] led to a massive increase in Germany's economic and industrial strength. Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and Wilhelm II, who became Emperor in 1890, sought to use that to create a ''Kaiserliche Marine'' or [[Imperial German Navy]] to compete with Britain's [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.&lt;ref name=willmott21/&gt; Their rationale was based on the ideas of US naval strategist [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Mahan]], who argued that whoever ruled the sea also ruled the world; Tirpitz had Mahan's books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his officers.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Herwig,"The Failure of German Sea Power, 1914–1945: Mahan, Tirpitz, and Raeder Reconsidered", ''The International History Review'', 10:1 (February 1988), 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wilhelm annoyed his ministers by publicly declaring one motive to be his childhood admiration of the Royal Navy, which he had visited "with kind aunts and friendly admirals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moll, Kendall |first1=Luebbert, Gregory |title=Arms Race and Military Expenditure Models: A Review |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=1980 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=153–185 |jstor=173938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was the [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]. With the launch of {{HMS |Dreadnought |1906 |6}} in 1906, the Royal Navy increased its advantage over its German rival and continued to do so.&lt;ref name=willmott21&gt;{{harvnb |Willmott |2003 |p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, the German economy could no longer support both naval expansion and the largest permanent army in Europe, with Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] acknowledging defeat. In many ways, it was a strategic disaster for Germany, diverting huge resources to create a navy large enough to antagonise Britain but not defeat it.

Ending the naval arms race reduced tensions between Britain and Germany but did not lead to reductions elsewhere; in 1913, Germany approved an increase in its standing army by 170,000 men, Russia committed to another 500,000 men over the next three years, while France extended compulsory military service from two to three years. Between 1870 and 1914, total military spending by Austria, Germany, Italy, and Russia increased from [[Pound sterling|£]]94 million to £394 million (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|0.394|1914}} billion in {{Inflation/year|UK}}). The largest proportional increases occurred in Germany (+73%) and Russia (+39%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Poon |first1=H.W. |title=Militarism; the Arms Race |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~salvador/Spring%20thru%20February/World%20War%201/Causes%20of%20World%20War%20I,%20Militarism.pdf |website=The Corner; World War I |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts in the Balkans===
[[File:1908-10-07 - Moritz Schiller's Delicatessen.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of large white building with one signs saying "Moritz Schiller" and another in Arabic; in front is a cluster of people looking at poster on the wall.|Sarajevo citizens reading a poster with the proclamation of the [[Bosnian Crisis|Austrian annexation in 1908]]]]

In October 1908, Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|had occupied]] since 1878. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]]. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the "[[powder keg of Europe]]".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=48–49}}

In 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent [[Albania]]n state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it sparked the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], by the end of which it lost most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to Serbia and Greece, and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania, further destabilising the region.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |pp=2–23}} The [[Great Powers]] were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.

==Prelude==

===Sarajevo assassination===
{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}
[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|thumb |This picture is usually associated with the arrest of [[Gavrilo Princip]], although some&lt;ref name="FinestoneMassie"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Finestone |first2=Robert K. |last2=Massie |title=The last courts of Europe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-1cvAAAAMAAJ |page=247}} |year=1981 |publisher=Dent |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith |2010}} believe it depicts Ferdinand Behr, a bystander.]]

On 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir presumptive to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]]. A group of six assassins ([[Cvjetko Popović]], [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], [[Trifko Grabež]], and [[Vaso Čubrilović]]) from the [[Yugoslavism|Yugoslavist]] group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], supplied with arms by the Serbian [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade was to pass, with the intention of assassinating him. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces, which Austria-Hungary had annexated from the Ottoman Empire, so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia.

Čabrinović threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed. Some nearby were injured by the blast, but Ferdinand's convoy carried on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them.

About an hour later, when Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, Princip stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Although they were reportedly not personally close, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was profoundly shocked and upset. The reaction among the people in Austria, however, was mild, almost indifferent. As historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]] later wrote, "the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday (28 and 29 June), the crowds in [[Vienna]] listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/european-powers-maintain-focus-despite-killings-in-sarajevo |title=European powers maintain focus despite killings in Sarajevo &amp;nbsp;– This Day in History |date=30 June 1914 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Willmott |2003 |p=26}} Nevertheless, the political impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant, and was described by historian [[Christopher Clark]] on the BBC Radio 4 series ''Month of Madness'' as a "[[September 11 attacks#Effects|9/11 effect]], a terrorist event charged with historic meaning, transforming the political chemistry in Vienna."&lt;ref name="Christopher Clark 2014"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Month of Madness |first=Christopher |last=Clark |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t7p27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina===
[[File:1914-06-29 - Aftermath of attacks against Serbs in Sarajevo.png|thumbnail|Crowds on the streets in the aftermath of the [[anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo]], 29 June 1914]]

The Austro-Hungarian authorities encouraged the subsequent [[anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo]], in which [[Bosnian Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]] killed two [[Bosnian Serbs]] and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings.&lt;ref name="DjordjevićSpence1992"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dimitrije |last1=Djordjević |first2=Richard B. |last2=Spence |title=Scholar, patriot, mentor: historical essays in honor of Dimitrije Djordjević |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=CDJpAAAAMAAJ |page=313}} |year=1992 |publisher=East European Monographs |isbn=978-0-88033-217-0 |page=313 |quote=Following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Croats and Muslims in Sarajevo joined forces in an anti-Serb pogrom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports Service: Southeast Europe series |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QGtWAAAAMAAJ}} |accessdate=7 December 2013 |year=1964 |publisher=American Universities Field Staff. |page=44 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;the assassination was followed by officially encouraged anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. A further 460 Serbs were sentenced to death. A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the ''[[Schutzkorps]]'' was established and carried out the persecution of Serbs.&lt;ref name="Kröll2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=Herbert |last=Kröll |title=Austrian-Greek encounters over the centuries: history, diplomacy, politics, arts, economics |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uJRnAAAAMAAJ}} |accessdate=1 September 2013 |year= 2008 |publisher=Studienverlag |isbn=978-3-7065-4526-6 |page=55 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;arrested and interned some 5.500 prominent Serbs and sentenced to death some 460 persons, a new Schutzkorps, an auxiliary militia, widened the anti-Serb repression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Tomasevich |2001 |p=485}}&lt;ref name="Schindler2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=John R. |last=Schindler |title=Unholy Terror: Bosnia, Al-Qa'ida, and the Rise of Global Jihad |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=c8Xb6x2XYvIC |page=29}} |year=2007 |publisher=Zenith Imprint |isbn=978-1-61673-964-5 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Velikonja |2003 |p=141}}

=== July Crisis ===
{{Main|July Crisis}}

The assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain, called the [[July Crisis]]. Austria-Hungary correctly believed that Serbian officials (especially the officers of the Black Hand) were involved in the plot to murder the Archduke, and wanted to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia.{{sfn |Stevenson |1996 |p=12}} On 23 July, Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia the [[July Crisis#Austro-Hungarian ultimatum|July Ultimatum]], a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |p=27}} Serbia decreed general mobilisation on the 25th. Serbia accepted all of the terms of the ultimatum except for article six, which demanded that Austrian delegates be allowed in Serbia for the purpose of participation in the investigation into the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, David; ''Europe's Last Summer: Why the World Went to War in 1914'', Heinemann, 2004; pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Austria broke off diplomatic relations with Serbia and, the next day, ordered a partial mobilisation. Finally, on 28 July 1914, a month after the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|left|Ethno-linguistic map of Austria-Hungary, 1910. [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina was annexed]] in 1908.]]
On 29 July, Russia, in support of Serbia, declared partial mobilisation against Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{harv|Levy|Vasques|2014|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th, Russia ordered general mobilisation. German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg waited until the 31st for an appropriate response, when Germany declared ''Erklärung des Kriegszustandes'', or "State of danger of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martel |first1=Gordon |title=The Month that Changed the World: July 1914 and WWI |date=2014 |publisher=OUP |location=6286 |edition=Kindle |ref=B00K79UOPK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=31 July 1914 |title=Verordnung, betreffend die Erklärung des Kriegszustandes |language=German |journal=Reichs-gesetzblatt |lccn=14013198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaiser Wilhelm II asked his cousin, Tsar [[Nicolas II]], to suspend the Russian general mobilisation. When he refused, Germany issued an ultimatum demanding its mobilisation be stopped, and a commitment not to support Serbia. Another was sent to France, asking her not to support Russia if it were to come to the defence of Serbia. On 1 August, after the Russian response, Germany mobilised and declared war on Russia. This also led to the general mobilisation in Austria-Hungary on 4 August.

The German government issued demands to France that it remain neutral as they had to decide which deployment plan to implement, it being difficult if not impossible to change the deployment whilst it was underway. The modified German [[Schlieffen Plan]], ''Aufmarsch II West'', would deploy 80% of the army in the west, and ''Aufmarsch I Ost'' and ''Aufmarsch II Ost'' would deploy 60% in the west and 40% in the east as this was the maximum that the East Prussian railway infrastructure could carry. The French did not respond, but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border to avoid any incidents, and at the same time ordered the mobilisation of their reserves. Germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing ''Aufmarsch II West''.

On 1 August, Wilhelm ordered General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] to "march the whole of the ... army to the East" after being wrongly informed the British would remain neutral if France was not attacked. Moltke told the Kaiser that attempting to redeploy a million men was unthinkable, and that making it possible for the French to attack the Germans "in the rear" would prove disastrous. Yet Wilhelm insisted that the German army should not march into [[Luxembourg]] until he received a telegram sent by his cousin [[George V]], who made it clear that there had been a misunderstanding. Eventually the Kaiser told Moltke, "Now you can do what you want."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11002644/First-World-War-centenary-how-events-unfolded-on-August-1-1914.html The Telegraph, ''First World War centenary: how the events of 1 August 1914 unfolded'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMeekin, Sean, July 1914: Countdown to War, Basic Books, 2014, 480 p., {{ISBN|978-0465060740}}, pp. 342, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening hostilities===
====Confusion among the Central Powers====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.{{sfn |Strachan |2003 |pp=292–296, 343–354}}&lt;!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: "Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War" --&gt; Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

====Serbian campaign====
{{Main|Serbian Campaign of World War I}}
[[File:FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg|thumb|Serbian Army [[Blériot XI]] "Oluj", 1915]]

Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Cer]] and [[Battle of Kolubara]] beginning on 12 August. Over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory. As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=172}} Serbia's defeat of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of 1914 has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=John R. |last=Schindler |url=http://wih.sagepub.com/content/9/2/159.abstract |title=Disaster on the Drina: The Austro-Hungarian Army in Serbia, 1914 |journal=War in History |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=159–195 |date=1 April 2002 |accessdate=13 March 2013|doi=10.1191/0968344502wh250oa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====German Offensive in Belgium and France====
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
[[File:German soldiers in a railroad car on the way to the front during early World War I, taken in 1914. Taken from greatwar.nl site.jpg|thumb|German soldiers in a railway [[goods wagon]] on the way to the front in 1914. Early in the war, all sides expected the conflict to be a short one.]]
[[File:Georges Scott, A la baïonnette !.jpg|thumb|French bayonet charge, [[Battle of the Frontiers]]; by the end of August, French casualties exceeded 260,000, including 75,000 dead.]]

When the war began, the [[German Army order of battle (1914)|German Order of Battle]] placed 80% of the army in the West, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East. The plan was to quickly knock France out of the war, then redeploy to the East and do the same to Russia.

The German offensive in the West was officially titled ''Aufmarsch I West,'' but is better known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], after its original creator. [[Alfred von Schlieffen|Schlieffen]] deliberately kept the German left (i.e. its positions in Alsace-Lorraine) weak to lure the French into attacking there, while the majority were allocated to the German right, so as to sweep through Belgium, encircle Paris and trap the French armies against the Swiss border (the French charged into Alsace-Lorraine on the outbreak of war as envisaged by their [[Plan XVII]], thus actually aiding this strategy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horne |first1=Alistair |title=The Price of Glory |date=1964 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0140170412 |page=22 |edition=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schlieffen's successor [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Moltke]] grew concerned that the French might push too hard on his left flank. As such, as the German Army increased in size in the years leading up to the war, he changed the allocation of forces between the German right and left wings from 85:15 to 70:30. Ultimately, Moltke's changes meant insufficient forces to achieve decisive success and thus unrealistic goals and timings.{{sfn |Holmes |2014 |pp=194, 211}}{{Dubious|date=November 2018}}

The initial German advance in the West was very successful: by the end of August the Allied left, which included the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), was in [[Great Retreat|full retreat]]; French casualties in the first month exceeded 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the [[Battle of the Frontiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stevenson |first1=David |title=1914–1918: The History of the First World War |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0718197957 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; German planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914, [[Alexander von Kluck|von Kluck]] used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the German armies as they closed on Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Julian |title=A Certain Idea of France: The Life of Charles de Gaulle |date=2018 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=978-1846143519 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French and British exploited this gap to halt the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] from 5 to 12 September and push the German forces back some {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.

In 1911, the Russian [[Stavka]] had agreed with the French to attack Germany within 15 days of mobilisation; this was unrealistic and the two Russian armies that entered [[East Prussia]] on 17 August did so without many of their support elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lieven |first1=Dominic |title=Towards the Flame: Empire, War and the End of Tsarist Russia |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141399744 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2nd Army (Russian Empire)|Russian Second Army]] was effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] on 26–30 August but the Russian advance caused the Germans to re-route their [[8th Army (German Empire)|8th Field Army]] from France to East Prussia, a factor in Allied victory on the Marne.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

By the end of 1914, German troops held strong defensive positions inside France, controlled the bulk of France's domestic coalfields and had inflicted 230,000 more casualties than it lost itself. However, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=376–378}} This amounted to a strategic defeat; shortly after the Marne, [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]] told an American reporter; "We have lost the war.

====Asia and the Pacific====
{{Main|Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I}}
[[File:Melbourne recruiting WWI.jpg|thumb |[[Military recruitment]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], 1914]]

New Zealand [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] [[German Samoa]] (later Western Samoa) on 30 August 1914. On 11 September, the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] landed on the island of [[New Britain|Neu Pommern]] (later New Britain), which formed part of [[German New Guinea]]. On 28 October, the German cruiser {{SMS |Emden |1908 |6}} sank the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] in the [[Battle of Penang]]. Japan seized Germany's Micronesian colonies and, after the [[Siege of Tsingtao]], the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]] on the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula. As Vienna refused to withdraw the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS |Kaiserin Elisabeth}} from Tsingtao, Japan declared war not only on Germany, but also on Austria-Hungary; the ship participated in the defence of Tsingtao where it was sunk in November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Donko, Wilhelm M. (2012).

====African campaigns====
{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}
[[File:Recruiting for the Holy War near Tiberias 1914.jpg|thumb |[[Military recruitment]] near [[Tiberias]], [[Ottoman Empire]], 1914]]

Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa. On 6–7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]] and [[Kamerun]]. On 10 August, German forces in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.{{sfn |Farwell |1989 |p=353}}

====Indian support for the Allies====
{{Further|Hindu–German Conspiracy|Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition|Third Anglo-Afghan War}}

Germany attempted to use Indian nationalism and pan-Islamism to its advantage, [[Hindu–German Conspiracy|instigating uprisings in India]], and [[Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition|sending a mission]] that urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers. However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards Britain.{{sfn |Brown |1994 |pp=197–198}}{{sfn |Brown |1994 |pp=201–203}} Indian political leaders from the [[Indian National Congress]] and other groups were eager to support the British war effort, since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of [[Indian Home Rule movement|Indian Home Rule]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the central government and the [[princely state]]s sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000&amp;nbsp;men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm |title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War |publisher=Memorial Gates Trust |accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the British government to grant self-government to India after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and fuelled [[Indian independence movement|the campaign for full independence]] that would be led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]] and others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Horniman, Benjamin Guy. ''British administration and the Amritsar massacre''. Mittal Publications, 1984. Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Front===
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}

====Trench warfare begins====
[[File:Cheshire Regiment trench Somme 1916.jpg|thumb|Trenches of the 11th [[Cheshire Regiment]] at Ovillers-la-Boisselle, on the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], July 1916]]

Military tactics developed before World War I failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. These advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while [[artillery]], vastly&lt;!--between HE }} hydraulic recoil mechanisms, something like two orders of magnitude--&gt; more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine gun]]s, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=424}} Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for [[Trench warfare|breaching entrenched]] positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas warfare]] and the [[Tanks in World War I|tank]].{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |pp=421–423}}

After the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914), Allied and German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the "[[Race to the Sea]]". By the end of 1914, the opposing forces were left confronting each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's coast.&lt;ref name=AJPT2/&gt; Since the Germans were able to choose where to stand, they normally had the advantage of the high ground; in addition, their trenches tended to be better built, since Anglo-French trenches were initially intended as "temporary," preparatory to breaking the German defences.{{sfn |Goodspeed |1985 |p=199 (footnote)}}

Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the Germans (violating the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]) used [[chlorine]] gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Love |1996}} Tanks were developed by Britain and France and were first used in combat by the British during the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the Germans employed only a few of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.

====Continuation of trench warfare====
[[File:French 87th Regiment Cote 34 Verdun 1916.jpg|thumb|upright|French 87th regiment near Verdun, 1916]]

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. Throughout 1915–17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. Strategically, while the Germans only mounted one major offensive, the Allies made several attempts to break through the German lines.

In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the [[Battle of Verdun]], lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000{{sfn |Dupuy |1993 |p=1042}} to 975,000{{sfn |Grant |2005 |p=276}} casualties suffered between the two combatants.

[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mud stained British soldiers at rest |[[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a communications trench, [[first day on the Somme]], 1916]]

The [[Battle of the Somme]] was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The [[first day on the Somme|opening day]] of the offensive (1 July 1916) was the bloodiest day in the history of the [[British Army]], suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000.{{sfn |Harris |2008 |p=271}} Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as [[trench foot]], shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties (body lice) and the ‘Spanish Flu’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://trenchwarfareworldwar1.weebly.com/living-conditions.html |title=Living conditions |website=Trench Warfare|access-date=19 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420074403/https://trenchwarfareworldwar1.weebly.com/living-conditions.html|archive-date=20 April 2018|dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=It's a self-published Weebly website|date=June 2018}}

Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916,{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1221}} combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts using [[frontal assault]] came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread [[French Army Mutinies]], after the failure of the costly [[Nivelle Offensive]] of April–May 1917.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=854}} The concurrent British [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=325–326}}{{sfn |Strachan |2003 |p=244}} A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]], became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.{{sfn |Inglis |1995 |p=2}}{{sfn |Humphries |2007 |p=66}}

The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack (with French support) at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] (July–November 1917). This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.

The years of trench warfare on the Western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. However, throughout this period, British, French, and German [[Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917|tactics constantly evolved]] to meet new battlefield challenges.

===Naval war===

At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied [[merchant shipping]]. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. Before the beginning of the war, it was widely understood that Britain held the position of strongest, most influential navy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://warandsecurity.com/2014/08/04/the-naval-balance-of-power-in-1914/ |title=The Naval Balance of Power in 1914 |date=4 August 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Looks to be a [[WP:SPS|SPS]] blog post.|date=May 2018}} The publishing of the book ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'' by [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] in 1890 was intended to encourage the United States to increase their naval power.

However, most of the [[German East Asia Squadron|German East-Asia squadron]]—consisting of the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, light cruisers {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}} and {{SMS|Leipzig|1905|2}} and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it met British warships. The German flotilla and {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}} sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was virtually destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the [[Battle of Más a Tierra]] these too had been destroyed or interned.{{sfn |Taylor |2007 |pp=39–47}}

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.{{sfn|Keene |2006 |p=5}} Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.{{sfn|Halpern |1995 |p=293}} Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.{{sfn|Zieger |2001 |p=50}}

The [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or "Battle of the [[Skagerrak]]") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war. It was the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], fought the Royal Navy's [[Grand Fleet]], led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeremy Black |title=Jutland's Place in History |journal=Naval History |date=June 2016 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the "[[Prize rules|cruiser rules]]", which demanded warning and movement of crews to "a place of safety" (a standard that lifeboats did not meet).{{sfn |von der Porten |1969}} Finally, in early 1917, Germany adopted a policy of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], realising that the Americans would eventually enter the war.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones |2001 |p=80}} Germany sought to strangle Allied [[sea lane]]s before the United States could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.&lt;ref name="Sheffield"/&gt;

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in [[Convoys in World War I|convoys]], escorted by [[destroyer]]s. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charge]]s were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nslegislature.ca/index.php/committees/committee_hansard/C11/va_2006nov09 |title=Committee Hansard |date=9 November 2006 |author=Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs |accessdate=12 March 2013 |website=Hansard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Roger |last1=Chickering |first2=Stig |last2=Förster |first3=Bernd |last3=Greiner |series=Publications of the German Historical Institute |location=Washington, DC |year=2005 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=evVPoSwqrG4C |page=73}} |title=A world at total war: global conflict and the politics of destruction, 1937–1945 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-83432-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I also saw the first use of [[aircraft carrier]]s in combat, with {{HMS |Furious |47 |6}} launching [[Sopwith Camel]]s in a successful raid against the [[Zeppelin]] hangars at [[Tondern raid|Tondern]] in July 1918, as well as [[blimp]]s for antisubmarine patrol.&lt;ref name="price1980"&gt;{{harvnb |Price |1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Faced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia.&lt;ref name="TuckerRoberts2005"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Spencer |last1=Tucker |first2=Priscilla Mary |last2=Roberts |title=World War One |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2YqjfHLyyj8C |page=241}} |year= 2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-420-2 |pages=241–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austro-Hungarian provinces of [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] provided troops for Austria-Hungary in the fight with Serbia, Russia and Italy. Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.{{sfn |Neiberg |2005 |pp=54–55}}

Bulgaria declared war on Serbia on 12 October 1915 and joined in the attack by the Austro-Hungarian army under Mackensen's army of 250,000 that was already underway. Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]. The Serbs suffered defeat in the [[Kosovo Offensive (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=1075–1076}} After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.{{sfn|DiNardo|2015|p=102}}

In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers. However, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro-Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] before the Allied expeditionary force arrived.{{sfn |Neiberg |2005 |pp=108–110}} The friction between the King of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the [[National Schism]], which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos in Salonica. After intense negotiations and an armed confrontation in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces (an incident known as [[Noemvriana]]), the King of Greece resigned and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place; Greece officially joined the war on the side of the Allies in June 1917.

The Macedonian Front was initially mostly static. French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 following the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilisation of the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Richard |title=Balkan Breakthrough: The Battle of Dobro Pole 1918 |year=2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location= |page=11 |isbn=978-0-253-35452-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918 in the [[Vardar Offensive]], after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians were defeated at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]], and by 25 September British and French troops had crossed the border into Bulgaria proper as the Bulgarian army collapsed. Bulgaria capitulated four days later, on 29 September 1918.{{sfn |Tucker |Wood |Murphy |1999 |pp=150–152}} The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.&lt;ref name=militera&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/korsun_ng4/06.html |title=The Balkan Front of the World War |language=Russian |first=N. |last=Korsun |publisher=militera.lib.ru |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disappearance of the Macedonian Front meant that the road to [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the [[Central Powers]] and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.{{sfn|Doughty |2005 |p=491}}

The Ottomans threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with India via the [[Suez Canal]]. As the conflict progressed, the Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the indigenous [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian populations, known as the [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]], and [[Assyrian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gettleman |editor1-first=Marvin |editor2-last=Schaar |editor2-first=Stuart |title=The Middle East and Islamic world reader |date=2003 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8021-3936-8 |pages=119–120 |edition=4th pr. |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=srLGT3dwTogC}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=January |first1=Brendan |title=Genocide : modern crimes against humanity |date=2007 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |location=Minneapolis, Minn. |isbn=978-0-7613-3421-7 |page=14 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IoPMDp2WA6cC}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lieberman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lieberman |first1=Benjamin |title=The Holocaust and Genocides in Europe |date=2013 |publisher=Continuum Publishing Corporation |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9478-7 |pages=80–81 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ySFMAQAAQBAJ}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s (1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French, and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In [[Mesopotamia]], by contrast, after the defeat of the British defenders in the [[Siege of Kut]] by the Ottomans (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and Assyrian tribesmen, while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and Turcoman tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur J. Barker, ''The Neglected War: Mesopotamia, 1914–1918'' (London: Faber, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the west, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at the [[Battle of Romani]] by the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]] and the [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]. Following this victory, an [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] advanced across the [[Sinai Peninsula]], pushing Ottoman forces back in the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December and the [[Battle of Rafa]] on the border between the Egyptian [[Sinai]] and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Crawford |first2=Ian |last2=McGibbon |title=New Zealand's Great War: New Zealand, the Allies and the First World War |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mtEEuD_-2SMC |page=219}} |year=2007 |publisher=Exisle Publishing |pages=219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian armies generally had success in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.{{sfn|Fromkin |2004 |p=119}} He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops, insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter. He lost 86% of his force at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]].&lt;ref name=caven&gt;{{harvnb |Hinterhoff |1984 |pp=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]) in December 1914 in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to [[petroleum reservoir]]s around [[Baku]] near the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;a b c The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.403&lt;/ref&gt; Persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and Russian influence. The Ottomans and Germans were aided by [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Azeri]] forces, together with a large number of major Iranian tribes, such as the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]], [[Tangistani]]s, [[Luristani]]s, and [[Khamseh]], while the Russians and British had the support of [[Armenians|Armenian]] and Assyrian forces. The [[Persian Campaign]] was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the Ottomans and their allies. However, the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;a b c d e f g (Northcote 1922, pp. 788)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarikam.jpg|thumb|Russian forest trench at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]], 1914–1915]]

General [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]], the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.&lt;ref name=caven/&gt; In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from [[Georgia within the Russian Empire|Russian Georgia]] to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar abdicated in the course of the [[February Revolution]], and the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart.

The [[Arab Revolt]], instigated by the Arab bureau of the British [[Foreign Office]], started June 1916 with the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)|Battle of Mecca]], led by [[Sherif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]], the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]], resisted for more than two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]] before surrendering in January 1919.{{sfn |Sachar |1970 |pp=122–138}}

The [[Senussi]] tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the [[Senussi Campaign]]. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.{{sfn |Gilbert |1994}}

Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men. Total Ottoman casualties were 725,000 (325,000 dead and 400,000 wounded).&lt;ref name="Brief Ottoman History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanioglu |first=M.

Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Trentino]], the [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (Rijeka) and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its part in the Triple Alliance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hall |last=Gardner |title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=631TBgAAQBAJ |page=120}} |year=2015 |publisher=Ashgate |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy secretly agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany.&lt;ref name="Seymour" /&gt; At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Southern Tyrol]], Austrian Littoral and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]]. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later, Italy declared war on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas Nelson |last=Page |title=Italy and the world war |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nQgyAQAAIAAJ |page=142}} |year=1920 |publisher=Scribners |pages=142–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Austro-Hungarian troops, Tyrol]]

The Italians had numerical superiority, but this advantage was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which the fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall|page=108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening Vienna.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaiserschützen]] and [[Standschützen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916 (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Thompson |title=The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915–1919 |publisher=London: Faber and Faber |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[Battles of the Isonzo|Isonzo front]] along the [[Soča|Isonzo]] (Soča) River, northeast of [[Trieste]]. Of this eleven offensives, five were won by Italy, three remained inconclusive, and other three were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, after the [[Battle of Doberdò]], the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the [[Banjšice Plateau|Banjšice]] and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.

[[File:Kämpfe auf dem Doberdo.JPG|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Doberdò]], fought in August 1916 between the Italian and the Austro-Hungarian armies]]

The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans, and achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] ([[Kobarid]]). The Italian Army was routed and retreated more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} to reorganise, stabilising the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since the Italian Army had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Caporetto, the Italian Government ordered conscription of the so-called ''{{'}}99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99''): all males born in 1899 and prior, who were 18 years old or older. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through in a series of battles on the Piave and were finally decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October. On 1 November, the Italian Navy destroyed much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet stationed in [[Pula]], preventing it from being handed over to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 3 November, the Italians invaded Trieste from the sea. On the same day, the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] was signed. By mid-November 1918, the Italian military occupied the entire former Austrian Littoral and had seized control of the portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo.

====Romanian participation====
{{Main|Romania during World War I}}
[[File:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops, 1916]]

Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. On August 4, 1916, Romania and the Entente signed the Political Treaty  and  Military  Convention, that established  the coordinates  of  Romania’s  participation  in  the  war. In return, it received the Allies' formal sanction for the annexation of the Romanian-inhabited regions of Austria-Hungary. The action had large popular support&lt;ref&gt;Laurentiu-Cristian Dumitru, Preliminaries of Romania's entering the World War I,
No. 1/2012 , Bulletin of “Carol I”  National Defence University, Bucharest, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 August 1916, the Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|launched an attack]] against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, against the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove them back.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Barrett, ''Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova [[Romanian Campaign#Stabilization and stalemate (1917)|continued in 1917]], resulting in some battles won by Romanians at Mărăşesti, Mărăşti and Oituz and a costly stalemate for the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwar2.ro/primulrazboi/?language=en&amp;article=116 |title=The Battle of Marasti (July 1917) |publisher=WorldWar2.ro |date=22 July 1917 |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Falls, ''The Great War'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the [[October Revolution]] meant that Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917.

[[File:Romanian troops at Marasesti in 1917.jpg|thumb|Romanian troops during the [[Battle of Mărăşeşti]], 1917]]

In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over [[Bessarabia]] as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and [[Bolshevik]] Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia, inhabited by a Romanian majority, to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Charles Upson (1927). Bessarabia. New York City: Dodd, Mead.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of [[Compiègne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Béla |first=Köpeczi |title=Erdély története |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/571.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Béla |first=Köpeczi |title=History of Transylvania |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/429.html |isbn=978-84-8371-020-3 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Потери народонаселения в 20. веке |language=Russian |trans-title=The loss of population in the 20th Century |last=Erlikman |first=Vadim |year=2004 |location=Moscow |publisher=Русская панорама |isbn=978-5931651071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian plans for the start of the war called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from East Prussia by Hindenburg and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at the battles of Tannenberg and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.{{sfn |Tucker |2005 |p=715}}{{sfn |Meyer |2006 |pp=152–154, 161, 163, 175, 182}} Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership were instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated to Galicia, and, in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers with their [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]].&lt;ref name="Smele"&gt;{{harvnb |Smele}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August, they captured [[Warsaw]] and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.

Despite Russia's success in the June 1916 [[Brusilov Offensive]] against the Austrians in eastern Galicia,{{sfn |Schindler |2003}} the offensive was undermined by the reluctance of other Russian generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by [[Romania during World War I|Romania's entry into the war]] on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in Transylvania while a German-Bulgarian force attacked from the south; [[Bucharest]] was taken by the Central Powers on 6 December and Romania knocked out of the war. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia as [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsar]] remained at the front. The increasingly incompetent rule of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home.

Following the Tsar's abdication, [[Vladimir Lenin]]—with the help of the German government—was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia 16 April 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Germany got the Russian Revolution off the ground |url=https://www.dw.com/en/how-germany-got-the-russian-revolution-off-the-ground/a-41195312 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led by Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.{{sfn |Wheeler-Bennett |1956}}{{Citation not found}} Despite this enormous German success, the manpower required by the Germans to occupy the captured territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive, and secured relatively little food or other [[materiel]] for the Central Powers war effort.

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a small-scale invasion]] of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources, and to a lesser extent, to support the [[White movement|"Whites"]] (as opposed to the "Reds") in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn |Mawdsley |2008 |pp=54–55}} Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk]] and in [[Vladivostok]] as part of the [[North Russia Intervention]].

====Czechoslovak Legion====
{{Main|Czechoslovak Legion}}
[[File:Czech Troops.jpg|thumb |left|[[Czechoslovak Legion]], Vladivostok, 1918]]

The Czechoslovak Legion fought with the Entente; its goal was to win support for the independence of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The Legion in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was established in September 1914, in December 1917 in [[French Third Republic|France]] (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Czechoslovak Legion troops defeated the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army at the Ukrainian village of [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Zborov]], in July 1917. After this success, the number of Czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as Czechoslovak military power. In the [[Battle of Bakhmach]], the Legion defeated the Germans and forced them to make a truce.

In Russia, they were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War, siding with the Whites against the [[Bolsheviks]], at times controlling most of the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and conquering all the major cities of [[Siberia]]. The presence of the Czechoslovak Legion near [[Yekaterinburg]] appears to have been one of the motivations for the Bolshevik [[Shooting of the Romanov family|execution of the Tsar and his family]] in July 1918. Legionaries arrived less than a week afterwards and captured the city. Because Russia's European ports were not safe, the corps was evacuated by a long detour via the port of Vladivostok. The last transport was the American ship Heffron in September 1920.

===Central Powers peace overtures===
[[File:River Crossing NGM-v31-p338.jpg|thumb|"''[[They shall not pass]]"'', a phrase typically associated with the defence of Verdun]]

On 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a [[Romania during World War I#The counteroffensive of the Central Powers (September–December 1916)|successful offensive against Romania]], Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies.&lt;ref name=lanoszka&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/11/why-the-first-world-war-lasted-so-long/? |author=Alexander Lanoszka, Michael A. Hunzeker |title=Why the First War lasted so long |publisher=Washington Post |date=11 November 2018 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a "duplicitous war ruse".&lt;ref name=lanoszka/&gt;

Soon after, the US President, Woodrow Wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united Poland".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721–766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.

===1917–1918===
Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.

====Developments in 1917====
[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'écluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French Army lookout at his observation post, [[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]

The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months, before American intervention could make an impact. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&amp;nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&amp;nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.

On 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 292.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe Pétain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.

The victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.{{sfn|Heyman |1997 |pp=146–147}}

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. Italy opposed the proposals. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.{{sfn|Kurlander |2006}}{{sfn|Shanafelt |1985 |pp=125–130}}

They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.

The reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division, broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918. In two days the British and Indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the Ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)]] at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], the continuous trench lines at [[Battle of Tabsor (1918)|Tabsor]], [[Battle of Arara|Arara]], and the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)]] headquarters at [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Nablus]]. The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry. During virtually continuous operations by [[Australian Light Horse]], British mounted Yeomanry, Indian [[Lancers]], and New Zealand [[Mounted Riflemen|Mounted Rifle]] brigades in the [[Jezreel Valley]], they captured [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|Nazareth]], [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah and Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]], along with [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Haifa]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Daraa]] east of the Jordan River on the Hejaz railway. [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]] and [[Tiberias]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]] were captured on the way northwards to [[Damascus]]. Meanwhile, [[Third Transjordan attack|Chaytor's Force]] of Australian light horse, New Zealand mounted rifles, Indian, British West Indies and Jewish infantry captured the crossings of the [[Jordan River]], [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]], [[Amman]] and at Ziza most of the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)]]. The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed at the end of October, ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of [[Aleppo]].

====15 August 1917: Peace offer by the Pope====
{{See also|Pope Benedict XV#Peace efforts}}
On or shortly before 15 August 1917 [[Pope Benedict XV]] made a peace proposal&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Wednesday 15 August 1917, reprinted on p. 26 of ''Daily Telegraph'' Tuesday 15 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting:
* No annexations
* No indemnities, except to compensate for severe war damage in Belgium and parts of France and of Serbia
* A solution to the problems of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]]
* Restoration of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]
* Germany to pull out of Belgium and France
* Germany's overseas colonies to be returned to Germany
* General disarmament
* A Supreme Court of arbitration to settle future disputes between nations
* The freedom of the seas
* Abolish all retaliatory economic conflicts
* No point in ordering reparations, because so much damage had been caused to all belligerents

====Entry of the United States====
{{Main|American entry into World War I}}

At the outbreak of the war, the United States pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When the German U-boat [[SM U-20 (Germany)|''U-20'']] [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sank the British liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] on 7 May 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] insisted that America is "too proud to fight" but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. However, he also repeatedly warned that the United States would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. Former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced German acts as "piracy".{{sfn |Brands |1997 |p=756}} Wilson was narrowly re-elected in [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]] after campaigning with the slogan "he kept us out of war".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1915/10/12/page/1/article/wilson-for-america-first "Wilson for 'America First'"], ''[[The Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' (12 October 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John Milton.

[[File:USA bryter de diplomatiska förbindelserna med Tyskland 3 februari 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917]]

In January 1917, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.&lt;ref name="Karp-PoW-1979"&gt;{{harvnb |Karp |1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany on 2 April 1917,&lt;ref&gt;[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany"]] (Wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared 4 days later]].

The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled "Associated Power". The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8 million men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |title=Selective Service System: History and Records |publisher=Sss.gov |accessdate=27 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507211238/http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm |archivedate=7 May 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the US Congress granted US citizenship to Puerto Ricans to allow them to be drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the [[Jones–Shafroth Act]]. German General Staff assumptions that it would be able to defeat the British and French forces before American troops reinforced them were proven incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stone |first1=David |title=The Kaiser's Army: The German Army in World War One |date=2014 |publisher=COnway |location=London |isbn=978-1844862924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[Ireland]], and [[submarine]]s to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[US Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted American units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units to be used as filler material. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, and earned a unit [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for their actions at [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)|Château-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and Sechault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=US [[National Archives and Records Administration]] |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/ |title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I |accessdate=29 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604163502/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/ |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.{{sfn |Millett |Murray |1988 |p=143}}

====German Spring Offensive of 1918====
{{Main|Spring Offensive}}
[[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French soldiers under [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], with machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], 1918]]

Ludendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.{{sfn |Westwell |2004}}

British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.{{sfn |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{Citation not found}}

The front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&amp;nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}

[[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the [[Doullens Conference]] on 5 November 1917. General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and US commands operated largely independently.{{sfn|Moon |1996 |pp=495–196}}

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Blücher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained storm troopers.

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.

====New states enter the war====
In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks before defeating them at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]].{{sfn|Hovannisian |1967 |pp=1–39}}

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918, with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]]. The battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 British, [[Dominion]], and French troops, and by the end of its first day a gap {{convert|24|km|mi}} long had been created in the German lines. The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing Ludendorff to refer to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Vanwell |origyear=1977 |year=2004 |title=Shock Army of the British Empire: The Canadian Corps in the Last 100 Days of the Great War |last=Schreiber |first=Shane B. |place=St. Catharines, ON |isbn=978-1-55125-096-0 |oclc=57063659}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Rickard |2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Pan |origyear=1998 |year=1999 |title=1918: Year of Victory |last=Brown |first=Malcolm |place=London |isbn=978-0-330-37672-3 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an advance as far as {{convert|23|km|mi|0}}, German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.

Rather than continuing the Amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.&lt;ref name="Pitt-1962"&gt;{{harvnb |Pitt |2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the Offensive began, Ludendorff said: "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended." On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden: "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier."&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW" /&gt;

=====Battle of Albert=====

British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]] on 21 August.{{sfn |Terraine |1963}} The assault was widened by French&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW"&gt;{{harvnb |Gray |Argyle |1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then further British forces in the following days. During the last week of August the Allied pressure along a {{convert|110|km|mi|0|adj=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."&lt;ref name="Pitt-1962" /&gt;

Faced with these advances, on 2 September the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]] issued orders to withdraw in the south to the [[Hindenburg Line]]. This ceded without a fight the [[Salient (territory)|salient]] seized the previous April.{{sfn |Nicholson |1962}} According to Ludendorff, "We had to admit the necessity&amp;nbsp;... to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.{{sfn |Ludendorff |1919}} In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning on 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken. The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected.&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW" /&gt;

====Allied advance to the Hindenburg Line====
[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|An American major, piloting an [[observation balloon]] near the front, 1918]]

In September the Allies [[Hundred Days Offensive#Advance to the Hindenburg Line|advanced to the Hindenburg Line]] in the north and centre. The Germans continued to fight strong rear-guard actions and launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the Line continued to fall, with the BEF alone taking 30,441&amp;nbsp;prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September an assault by both the British and French came within {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} of St. Quentin. The Germans had now retreated to positions along or behind the Hindenburg Line. That same day, Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.&lt;ref name="Chron-FWW" /&gt;

The [[Hundred Days Offensive#Battles of the Hindenburg Line|final assault]] on the Hindenburg Line began with the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], launched by French and American troops on 26 September. The following week, co-operating French and American units broke through in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] at the [[Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge]], forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.{{sfn |McLellan |p=49}} On 8 October the line was pierced again by British and Dominion troops at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=For King and Empire: A Social History and Battlefield Tour |title=The Canadians at Cambrai and the Canal du Nord, August–September 1918 |publisher=CEF Books |year=1997 |last=Christie |first=Norm M. |isbn=978-1-896979-18-2 |oclc=166099767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions as it fell back towards Germany.

When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September, Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. Its reserves had been used up, even as US troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=380}}{{sfn |Hull |2006 |pp=307–310}}{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=383}} The Americans supplied more than 80% of Allied oil during the war, and there was no shortage.{{sfn |Painter |2012 |p=25 |ps=.

====German Revolution 1918-1919====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R72520, Kiel, Novemberrevolution, Matrosenaufstand.jpg|thumb|[[German Revolution]], Kiel, 1918]]

News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy.

In northern Germany, the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]], which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel mutiny|Kiel]], spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurkuhl.de/docs/kieler_14punkte.pdf|title=K.

====New German government surrenders====
With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government on 3 October as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military.{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |p=385}} There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic. The Kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and Wilhelm fled to exile in [[the Netherlands]]. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born as the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn |Stevenson |2004 |loc=Chapter 17}}

====Armistices and capitulations====

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918.&lt;ref name="indiana.edu-1918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1918.htm |website=League of Nations Photo Archive |title=1918 Timeline |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the [[Armistice of Mudros]].&lt;ref name="indiana.edu-1918"/&gt;

On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. This culminated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] ([[Armistice of Villa Giusti]]). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the following days the Italian Army occupied [[Innsbruck]] and all [[Tyrol]] with 20 to 22,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrea Di Michele |title=Trento, Bolzano E Innsbruck: L'occupazione Militare Italiana Del Tirolo (1918–1920) |language=it |trans-title=Trento, Bolzano and Innsbruck: The Italian Military Occupation of Tyrol (1918–1920) |journal=Trento e Trieste.

On 11 November, at 5:00 am, an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiègne. At 11&amp;nbsp;am on 11 November 1918—"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"—a ceasefire came into effect. During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. The [[occupation of the Rhineland]] took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.

In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany. Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185–188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.

The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25 billion. Among the Allies, the UK spent $21 billion and the US $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War, 1914–1918'' (1977) p. 153, using estimated made by H. Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1941) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}
In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian. Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the [[House of Romanov|Romanovs]], the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]], the [[Habsburg]]s, and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]]. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4&amp;nbsp;million soldiers dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm "France's oldest WWI veteran dies"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm |date=28 October 2016 }}, ''BBC News'', 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; not counting other casualties.

===Formal end of the war===

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hastedt |first=Glenn P. |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy |publisher=Infobase Publishing |series= |volume= |edition= |date=2009 |location= |page=483 |language= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-1-4381-0989-3 |mr= |zbl= |jfm=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murrin |first=John |authorlink= |last2=Johnson |first2=Paul | author2-link = |last3=McPherson |first3=James | author3-link = |last4=Gerstle |first4=Gary | author4-link = |last5=Fahs |first5=Alice | author5-link = |title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People |publisher=Cengage Learning |series= |volume=II |edition= |date=2010 |location= |page=622 |language= |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-495-90383-3 |mr= |zbl= |jfm=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the [[Knox–Porter Resolution]] was signed on 2 July 1921 by President [[Warren G.

After the Treaty of Versailles, treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the negotiation of the treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]] was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces left [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

===Peace treaties and national boundaries===

After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's 14th point]], brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.{{sfn |Magliveras |1999 |pp=8–12}}{{sfn |Northedge |1986 |pp=35–36}}

The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement was [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]]. This article became known as the War Guilt clause as the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |first=John H. |last=Morrow |title=The Great War: An Imperial History |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-20440-8 |lastauthoramp=y |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the "[[diktat]] of Versailles". German historian Hagen Schulze said the Treaty placed Germany "under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hagen |last=Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=B84ZaAdGbS4C |page=204}} |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard U.P. |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. The legend of the "[[stab in the back]]" and the wish to revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics. Even a man of peace such as &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Gustav Stresemann|Gustav]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt. As for the Nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the German nation into a spirit of revenge. Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Laurence Van |last=Ypersele |title=Mourning and Memory, 1919–45 |editor-first=John |editor-last=Horne |work=A Companion to World War I |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EjZHLXRKjtEC |page=584}} |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley |page=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:William Orpen - The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|The signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in the [[Hall of Mirrors]], Versailles, 28 June 1919, by [[Sir William Orpen]]]]

Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Surrogate Hegemon in Polish Postcolonial Discourse Ewa Thompson, Rice University |url=http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ethomp/The%20Surrogate%20Hegemon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Conference required all the defeated powers to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all the damage done to civilians. However, owing to economic difficulties and Germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on Germany.

Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and [[Yugoslavia]], largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]], only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Károly |last1=Kocsis |first2=Eszter Kocsisné |last2=Hodosi |title=Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin |year=1998 |isbn=978-963-7395-84-0 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of [[History of Estonia#Road to the republic|Estonia]], [[History of Finland#Independence and Civil War|Finland]], [[History of Latvia#Independence|Latvia]], [[History of Lithuania#Independent Lithuania (1918–40)|Lithuania]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it. Romania took control of Bessarabia in April 1918.{{sfn |Clark |1927}}

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, with much of its [[Levant]] territory awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates. The Turkish core in [[Anatolia]] was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], leading to the victorious [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the much less stringent 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

Even though a lot of countries had already made a peace treaty, there was one exception, [[Andorra]]. Andorra declared war on Germany in August 1914, but, because it had a very small population, Andorra had never sent any soldiers to the battlefield. Because of that, Andorra wasn't allowed to go to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], so the country hadn't made a peace treaty with Germany until 1958.
When Andorra made the declaration of war, it had an army of 600 part-time militarymen, commanded by two officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://everything-everywhere.com/8-facts-about-andorra/ | title=8 Facts You Might Not Have Known About Andorra| date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://halfapage.com/44-year-war-germany-andorra/ | title=The 44 year war between Germany and Andorra| date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/wars-that-were-extended-by-quirks-of-diplomacy-2015-12?IR=T/#andorra-and-the-german-empire-6 | title=9 wars that were technically ongoing due to quirks of diplomacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/worldwarone/25-things-you-might-not-know-about-world-war-one/5546018 | title=25 things you might not know about WWI| date=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East.

In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]] became known as those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]].

World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century [[military tactics|tactics]], with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82–86}} and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies&lt;!--- surely most companies at the start of the war had more than 200-men!---&gt; were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.

Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008). Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1-85109-732-6}} p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

[[File:Austin21.jpg|thumb|A Russian armoured car, 1919]]

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in using heavy indirect fire. The German Army employed {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only {{convert|75|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The British had a 6-inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm "[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]

On 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed "[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]". This gun from [[Krupp]] was able to shoot 750&amp;nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Much of the combat involved [[trench warfare]], in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War I. Such battles include [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

[[File:mustard gas burns.jpg|thumb |left|A Canadian soldier with [[mustard gas]] burns, c. 1917–1918]]

The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] were both outlawed by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Postwar pulp novels on future "gas wars" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful land-based weapons were [[railway gun]]s, weighing dozens of tons apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|"Heavy Railroad Artillery"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&amp;nbsp;kilograms (210&amp;nbsp;lb).

[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]

Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&amp;nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].

Another new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

====Areas taken in major attacks====
[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=4.0]]

On the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], and [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]] {{mdash}} the exception was [[Nivelle Offensive|Nivelle's Offensive]] in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: [[Operation Michael|Michael]], on the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Lys]], and on the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne]], which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]]; tanks played a prominent role in both of these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.

The areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|First Masurian Lakes]] driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive|Gorlice–Tarnów]], which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in [[Vardar Offensive|Macedonia]], which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]], the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.

===Naval===

Germany deployed [[U-boat]]s ([[submarine]]s) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), [[hydrophone]]s (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).&lt;ref name="price1980"/&gt; To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the [[interwar period]] until World War II revived the need.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Sondhaus, ''The Great War at Sea: A Naval History of the First World War'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}
[[File:Sopwith F-1 Camel.jpg|thumb|left|[[RAF]] [[Sopwith Camel]]. In April 1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Eric |last1=Lawson |first2=Jane |last2=Lawson |year=2002 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9PGHckhHiX0C}}pg=PT123 |title=The First Air Campaign: August 1914– November 1918 |publisher=Da Capo Press |p=123 |isbn= 978-0-306-81213-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, [[anti-aircraft guns]] and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bomber]]s were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.&lt;ref name="Cross 1991"&gt;{{harvnb |Cross |1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the conflict, [[aircraft carrier]]s were used for the first time, with {{HMS |Furious |47 |6}} launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in [[Tondern raid|a raid]] to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.{{sfn |Cross |1991 |pp=56–57}}

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,{{sfn |Winter |1983}} so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.&lt;ref name=FullCircle&gt;{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.&lt;ref name="Cross 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=FullCircle/&gt;

On 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Baralong}}. All German survivors were [[summarily executed]] by ''Baralong''{{'}}s crew on the orders of Lieutenant [[Godfrey Herbert]], the captain of the ship. The shooting was reported to the media by American citizens who were on board the ''Nicosia'', a British freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by U-27 just minutes before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, Paul G. (1994). A Naval History of World War I. Routledge, p. 301; {{ISBN|1-85728-498-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September, ''Baralong'' destroyed [[SM U-41 (Germany)|U-41]], which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship ''Urbino''. According to Karl Goetz, the submarine's commander, ''Baralong'' continued to fly the US flag after firing on U-41 and then rammed the lifeboat—carrying the German survivors—sinking it.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, Michael L.

The Canadian hospital ship {{HMHS|Llandovery Castle}} was torpedoed by the German submarine [[SM U-86]] on 27 June 1918 in violation of international law. Only 24 of the 258 medical personnel, patients, and crew survived. Survivors reported that the U-boat surfaced and ran down the lifeboats, machine-gunning survivors in the water. The U-boat captain, [[Helmut Patzig]], was charged with war crimes in Germany following the war, but escaped prosecution by going to the [[Free City of Danzig]], beyond the jurisdiction of German courts.&lt;ref name="Davies2013c"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.D. |last=Davies |authorlink=J.

===Chemical weapons in warfare===

[[File:French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German trenches in Flanders. Belgium., ca. 1900 - 1982 - NARA - 530722.tif|thumb|left|French soldiers making a gas and flame attack on German trenches in Flanders]]

The first successful use of [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] as a weapon of warfare occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915).&lt;ref&gt;A German attempt in January on the Russian front failed to cause casualties.&lt;/ref&gt; Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Barry R. (28 February 1999). Future War and Counterproliferation: US Military Responses to NBC. Praeger, p. 84; {{ISBN|0-275-96278-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1899|1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases]] and the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare]], which prohibited their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hEH7KcpN-OcC |page=34}} |title=The Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir |first=Telford |last=Taylor |year=1993 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=978-0-316-83400-1 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0PYx0j3wRvAC |page=7}} |title=Cornerstones of Security: Arms Control Treaties in the Nuclear Era |first1=Thomas |last1=Graham |first2=Damien J. |last2=Lavera |date=2003 |pages=7–9 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |isbn=978-0-295-98296-0 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. Civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. In addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. British [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Sir Douglas Haig]] wrote in his diary, "My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Poisonous Cloud: Chemical Warfare in the First World War |first=L.F. |last=Haber |date=20 February 1986 |pages=106–108 |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-858142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dew of Death: The Story of Lewisite, America's World War I Weapon of Mass destruction |first=Joel A. |last=Vilensky |date=20 February 1986 |pages=78–80 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=978-0-253-34612-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |first=D.

The Armenians were intentionally [[Death march|marched to death]] and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands.{{sfn |Ferguson |2006 |p=177}} While an exact number of deaths is unknown, the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] estimates 1.5 million.&lt;ref name="IAGSletter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genocidescholars.org/sites/default/files/document%09%5Bcurrent-page%3A1%5D/documents/US%20Congress_%20Armenian%20Resolution.pdf |title=International Association Of Genocide Scholars |format=PDF |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Turkey has consistently [[Armenian Genocide denial|denied the genocide]], arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians.{{sfn |Fromkin |1989 |pp=212–215}}

===Rape of Belgium===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. In addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential ''[[francs-tireurs]]'' ([[guerrillas]]) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at [[Leuven|Louvain]]—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.{{sfn |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 1–2, esp. p. 76}} Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatising the [[Rape of Belgium]] attracted much attention in the United States, while Berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because of the threat of franc-tireurs like those in France in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;The claim of franc-tireurs in Belgium has been rejected: {{harvnb |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the United States, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.{{sfn |Horne |Kramer |2001 |loc=ch 5–8}}{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |pp=82–83}}

The British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were [[conscription|conscripted]] into service. Surviving veterans, returning home, often found they could discuss their experiences only amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed "veterans' associations" or "Legions". A small number of personal accounts of American veterans have been collected by the [[Library of Congress]] [[Veterans History Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/search?query=&amp;field=all&amp;war=worldwari |title=Search Results (+(war:"worldwari")) : Veterans History Project |publisher=American Folklife Center, Library of Congress |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German prisoners in a French prison camp. French Pictorial Service., 1917 - 1919 - NARA - 533724.tif|thumb|left|German prisoners in a French prison camp during the later part of the war]]

About eight million men surrendered and were held in [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]], and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.{{sfn |Phillimore |Bellot |1919 |pp=4–64}} Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered ''en masse''. At the siege of Maubeuge about 40,000 French soldiers surrendered, at the [[battle of Galicia]] Russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 Austrian captives, at the [[Brusilov Offensive]] about 325,000 to 417,000 Germans and Austrians surrendered to Russians, and at the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near [[Przasnysz]] (February–March 1915) 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, and at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies. 25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&amp;nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5–3.5 million men as prisoners). From the Central Powers about 3.3&amp;nbsp;million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians.{{sfn |Ferguson |1999 |pp=368–369}} Germany held 2.5&amp;nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9&amp;nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just before the Armistice. The United States held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.{{sfn |Blair |2005}}{{sfn |Cook |2006 |pp=637–665}} Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia: [[starvation]] was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died, and in Central Powers imprisonment 8% of Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profismart.ru/web/bookreader-115250-24.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130417092302/http://profismart.ru/web/bookreader-115250-24.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 April 2013 |title=Максим Оськин – Неизвестные трагедии Первой мировой Пленные Дезертиры Беженцы – стр 24 – Читаем онлайн |publisher=Profismart.ru |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.{{sfn |Speed |1990}}{{sfn |Ferguson |1999 |loc=Chapter 13}}{{sfn |Morton |1992}}

In Russia, when the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as [[forced labour]], e.g., in France until 1920.

In the Balkans, [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalists]] such as the leader, [[Ante Trumbić]], strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of [[Yugoslavs]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[Yugoslav Committee]], led by Trumbić, was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1189}} In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including [[Czechoslovak]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Transylvanian]], and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] representatives who urged the Allies to support national [[self-determination]] for the peoples residing within [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

In the Middle East, [[Arab nationalism]] soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] state.

A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{harvnb |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; But European socialists split on national lines, with the concept of [[class conflict]] held by radical socialists such as Marxists and [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] being overborne by their patriotic support for the war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=1069}} Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.{{sfn|Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=884}}

[[Italian nationalism]] was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], who promoted [[Italian irredentism]] and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=335}} The [[Italian Liberal Party]], under the leadership of [[Paolo Boselli]], promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=219}} Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Leonida Bissolati]].{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=209}} However, the [[Italian Socialist Party]] decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a [[general strike]] called [[Red Week (Italy)|Red Week]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{harvnb |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt; Mussolini, a [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and the ''Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista'' ("Revolutionary [[Fasci]] for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the ''[[Fasci di Combattimento]]'' in 1919, the origin of fascism.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=826}} Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies to create ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Mack Smith. 1997.

Once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolshevik]]s, the [[Socialist Party of America]], the [[Italian Socialist Party]], and people like [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and their followers in Germany.

[[Benedict XV]], elected to the papacy less than three months into World War I, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. In stark contrast to his [[pope Pius X|predecessor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of the Church |year=1981 |publisher=Burns &amp; Oates |location=London |isbn=978-0-86012-091-9 |translator-first=Margit |translator-last=Resch |volume=9 |series=The Church in the industrial age |first=Roger |last=Aubert |editor=Hubert Jedin |editor2=John Dolan |page=521 |chapter=Chapter 37: The Outbreak of World War I}}&lt;/ref&gt; five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. His first encyclical, ''[[Ad beatissimi Apostolorum]]'', given 1 November 1914, was concerned with this subject. Benedict XV found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers. The 1915 Treaty of London between Italy and the Triple Entente included secret provisions whereby the Allies agreed with Italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the Central Powers. Consequently, the publication of Benedict's proposed [[World War I#15 August 1917: peace offer by the Pope|seven-point Peace Note]] of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who's Who&amp;nbsp;– Pope Benedict XV |publisher=firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/popebenedict.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the [[British Army]], [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the imminence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present),
&lt;blockquote&gt;that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.&lt;ref&gt;''"Merely For the Record": The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorrien's career, or prevent him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities.

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the US, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors,&lt;ref name="Karp-PoW-1979"/&gt; and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] staunchly opposed taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pennell |first=Catriona |title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-959058-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland. Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain.{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |p=584}} The UK government placed Ireland under [[martial law]] in response to the Easter Rising, though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling.&lt;ref&gt;O'Halpin, Eunan, ''The Decline of the Union: British Government in Ireland, 1892–1920'', (Dublin, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; However, opposition to involvement in the war increased in Ireland, resulting in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight. In Britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.{{sfn |Lehmann |van der Veer |1999 |p=62}} Some of them, most notably prominent peace activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]], refused both military and [[alternative service]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Peter, ''These Strange Criminals: An Anthology of Prison Memoirs by Conscientious Objectors to Military Service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8020-8707-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many suffered years of prison, including [[solitary confinement]] and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors need apply".{{Cite quote |date=June 2017}}

The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12499.html |title=Soviet Union – Uzbeks |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a series of [[French Army Mutinies]] led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

In [[Milan]], in May 1917, [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.&lt;ref name="Seton_6"&gt;Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925''. London: Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian army was forced to enter [[Milan]] with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and [[Anarchism|anarchists]], who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city. Almost 50 people (including three Italian soldiers) were killed and over 800 people arrested.&lt;ref name="Seton_6"/&gt;

In September 1917, [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian soldiers in France]] began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied.{{sfn |Cockfield |1997 |pp=171–237}} In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, with the call going up for "bread, land, and peace".{{Cite quote |date=June 2017}} The Bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with Germany, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace of Brest-Litovsk]], despite its harsh conditions. The [[German Revolution of 1918-1919]] led to the abdication of the Kaiser and German surrender.

===Conscription===
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription, [[New York City]], 5 June 1917]]

[[Conscription]] was common in most European countries. However, it was controversial in English-speaking countries. It was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Ward, "Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish conscription crisis". ''Historical Journal'' (1974) 17#1 pp. 107–129.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia, and the French Catholics in Canada.

====Conscription in Canada====
{{Main|Conscription Crisis of 1917}}
In Canada the issue produced [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|a major political crisis that permanently alienated the Francophones]]. It opened a political gap between [[French Canadian]]s, who believed their true loyalty was to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to their British heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP12CH2PA3LE.html |title=The Conscription Crisis |publisher=CBC |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conscription in Australia====
{{Main|Conscription in Australia}}
In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by [[Billy Hughes]], the Prime Minister, caused a split in the [[Australian Labor Party]], so Hughes formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917 to pursue the matter. Farmers, the [[labour movement]], the Catholic Church, and the Irish Catholics successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|rejected in two plebiscites]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Main, ''Conscription: the Australian debate, 1901–1970'' (1970) [http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:338722 abstract] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20150707113023/http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:338722 |date=7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conscription in Britain====
{{Main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War}}
In Britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]]. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Chelmsford, J.E. "Clergy and Man-Power", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription lasted until mid-1919. Due to the political situation in Ireland, conscription was never applied there; only in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]].

====United States====
{{Main|Conscription in the United States#World War I}}
In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers, ''To raise an army: The draft comes to modern America'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Zinn, ''People's History of the United States''. (Harper Collins, 2003): 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).

Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for "obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service". The most famous was [[Eugene Debs]], head of the [[Socialist Party of America]], who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7 January 1918.

====Austria-Hungary====
Like all of the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being "run on colonial lines" and the Slav soldiers as "disaffected". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy===
{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I}}
The non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z.A.B. Zeman, ''Diplomatic History of the First World War'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

{{quote |&lt;poem&gt;The War was an unprecedented triumph for natural science. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Francis Bacon|Francis]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Bacon had promised that knowledge would be power, and power it was: power to destroy the bodies and souls of men more rapidly than had ever been done by human agency before.

Collingwood]], writing in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood ''An Autobiography'', 1939, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and is still underway, more than a century later.

===Historiography===
Historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones, "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography". ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp. 857–878 [858]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorials===
{{Main|World War I memorials}}
[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|A typical village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I]]

Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], the [[German War Graves Commission]], and [[Le Souvenir français]]. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unidentified]] dead, such as the [[Menin Gate]] memorial and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]].

In 1915 [[John McCrae]], a Canadian army doctor, wrote the poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'' as a salute to those who perished in the Great War.

[[National World War I Museum and Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I. The [[Liberty Memorial]] was dedicated on 1 November 1921, when the supreme Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="kclibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kclibrary.org/blog/week-kansas-city-history/monumental-undertaking |title=Monumental Undertaking |website=kclibrary.org|date=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I had a lasting impact on [[social memory]]. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark David |last=Sheftall |title=Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Samuel Hynes]] explained:

{{quote |A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.&lt;ref name="Hynes1991"/&gt;}}

This has become the most common perception of World War I, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King &amp; Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Hynes1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |authorlink=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though these views have been discounted as "myths",&lt;ref name="Hynes1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fussell2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |accessdate=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are common. They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as "aimless" following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s. The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153–221}}

The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle Époque|la belle époque]]'' was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the [[Lost Generation]].{{sfn |Roden}} For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.{{sfn |Wohl |1979}} Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]).{{sfn |Tucker |Roberts |2005 |pp=108–1086}} Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi–xv}}

===Discontent in Germany===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and [[Fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstoßlegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the "stab-in-the-back" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.

Communist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace |first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War I. Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624163832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II#53532.toc |archivedate=24 June 2008 |title=World War II |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=12 November 2009 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Baker |first=Kevin |url=http://www.harpers.org/StabbedInTheBack.html |title=Stabbed in the Back!

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all of the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Economic effects===
{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}
[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]

One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.

[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.

In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]&lt;ref&gt;10{{sup|9}} in this context&amp;nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]&lt;/ref&gt; of World War I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain FINALLY pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems £1.9bn |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}

[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (the so-called "war guilt" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&amp;pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for [[World War I reparations|reparations]], and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary. However neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Marls, The Myths of Reparations, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–232&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However, "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was to mislead public opinion&amp;nbsp;...  into believing the "total sum was being maintained."&lt;ref name=Marks237&gt;Marks, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars) "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay" and "therefore&amp;nbsp;... represented the total German reparations" figure that had to be paid.&lt;ref name=Marks237/&gt;

This figure could be paid in cash or in kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, pp.&amp;nbsp;223–234&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, the [[Great Depression]] arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;''World War One: A Short History'' By Norman Stone&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point Germany had only paid the equivalent of 20.598 billion gold marks in reparations.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. [[David A. Andelman|David Andelman]] notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the [[World War II|Second World War]], at the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Conference]] in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3 October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.{{efn|World War I officially ended when Germany paid off the final amount of reparations imposed on it by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=First World War officially ends |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8029948/First-World-War-officially-ends.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=15 March 2017 |quote=The final payment of £59.5 million, writes off the crippling debt that was the price for one world war and laid the foundations for another. |first=Allan |last=Hall |date=28 September 2010 |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html |title=Why Did World War I Just End? |last1=Suddath |first1=Claire |date=4 October 2010 |work=Time |accessdate=1 July 2013 |quote=World War I ended over the weekend.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11022">'''World polity theory''' (also referred to as '''world society theory''', '''global Neo-institutionalism''', and the '''"Stanford school" of global analysis''')&lt;ref name="boli" /&gt; was developed mainly as an analytical frame for interpreting global relations, structures, and practices.&lt;ref name="mcneely" /&gt; It was developed partly in response to the application of [[world systems theory]]. The theory views the world system as a social system with a cultural framework called world polity, which encompasses and influences the actors, such as [[nations]], [[international organizations]], and individuals under it.&lt;ref name="mcneely" /&gt;  In other words, according to John Boli and George M. Thomas, "the world polity is constituted by distinct culture – a set of fundamental principles and models, mainly ontological and cognitive in character, defining the nature and purposes of social actors and action."&lt;ref name="boli2" /&gt; The World polity theory views the primary component of the world society as "world polity", which provides a set of cultural norms or directions in which the actors of the [[world society]] follow in dealing with problems and general procedures.&lt;ref name="lechner" /&gt; In contrast to other theories such as [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realism]] or [[liberalism]], the theory considers other actors such as the states and institutions to be under the influence of global norms.&lt;ref name=lechner /&gt; Although it closely resembles constructivism, world polity theory is to be distinguished from it because "world-polity theorists have been far more resolute in taking the “cultural plunge” than their [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]] counterparts".&lt;ref name="boli" /&gt; In other words, world polity theory puts more of an emphasis on [[Monoculturalism|homogenization]] than the other. Through globalization, world polity and culture trigger the formation of enactable cultures and organizations while in return cultures and organizations elaborate the world society further.&lt;ref name="lechner" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1970s with its initiation by [[John W. Meyer]] of Stanford University, world polity analysis initially revolved around examining inter-state relations.&lt;ref name="boli3" /&gt; Simultaneously in the 1970s and also in the 1980s, a significant amount of work was done on [[international education]] environment.&lt;ref name="boli3" /&gt; However, in the 1980s and 1990s due to the noticeable influence of [[globalization]] on [[world culture]], the direction of the study shifted towards analyzing the [[transnational progressivism|transnational]] [[social movement]] that may amount to a global polity while at the same time attempting to better understand how global polity ideas are implemented through [[global actors]].&lt;ref name="boli3" /&gt;

==Implications==
Through a series of empirical studies, Meyer and others observed that new states organize themselves in a significantly similar manner despite their differing needs and background to give strength to their explanation that there is a set norm of forming a new state under the bigger umbrella of world polity.&lt;ref name="lechner" /&gt;

Other instances suggest a definite presence of world polity:
#A considerable degree of resemblance in national constitutions, which commonly contain the idea of [[self-determination]], [[state sovereignty]] and territorial integrity.&lt;ref name="boli3" /&gt;
#Schooling around the world showing [[isomorphism]].&lt;ref name="boli3" /&gt;
#Nitza Berkovitch stated that the occurrence of the international women's movement reflected the existence of world polity framework and so allows the world to be viewed as a single global social system.&lt;ref name="berkovich" /&gt;
#An empirical study of INGOs ([[International nongovernmental organizations]]) shows the existence of [[universalism]], [[individualism]], rational voluntaristic authority, progress and [[world citizenship]] across different INGOS. [[Sports]], [[human rights]], and environmental INGOS especially tend to "reify" world polity.&lt;ref name="boli2" /&gt; According to John Boli and George M. Thomas, who conducted this study, INGOS could instill world-cultural principles of world polity to nations by lobbying, criticizing, and convincing.&lt;ref name="boli2" /&gt;

==Limitations==
Critics point to the fact that world polity theory assumes a rather flawless and smooth transfer of norms of world polity to the global actors, which might not always be really plausible. Also, its tendency to focus on the homogenizing effect brings criticisms.&lt;ref name=boli3 /&gt; World culture theory differs in this aspect from world polity theory because it recognizes that actors find their own identities in relation to the greater global cultural [[norm (social)|norm]] instead of simply following what is suggested by the world polity.&lt;ref name="lechner" /&gt;

Also, an instance of ''[[glocalization]]'' cannot fully be explained by world polity theory. It is a phenomenon by which local values and global cultures converge to create something new.&lt;ref name="boli3" /&gt;

==Population by region==
Six of the [[Earth]]'s seven [[continents]] are permanently inhabited on a large scale. [[Asia]] is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, [[China]] and [[India]], together constitute about 36% of the world's population. [[Africa]] is the second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the world's population. [[Europe]]'s 742 million people make up 10% of the world's population as of 2018, while the [[Latin American]] and [[Caribbean]] regions are home to around 651 million (9%). [[Northern America]], primarily consisting of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], has a population of around 363 million (5%), and [[Oceania]], the least populated region, has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Analytical-Figures/htm/fig_2.htm|title=World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision Population Database |publisher=United Nations |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, [[Antarctica]] has a small, fluctuating international population based mainly in polar [[Research stations in Antarctica|science stations]].

==History==
{{See also|World population estimates|History of the world}}
Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of [[modernity]], possible only since the [[Age of Discovery]]. Early estimates for the population of the world&lt;ref&gt;the [[English compound|compound]] "world population" becomes common from c. the 1930s, adapted from early 20th-century "world's population"; pre-20th century authors use "population of the world".&lt;/ref&gt; date to the 17th century: [[William Petty]] in 1682 estimated world population at  320 million (modern estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with modern estimates).&lt;ref&gt;"The population of the world, which Sir W. P. in 1682, stated at only 320 millions, has been estimated by some writers at about 730 millions, by others, at upwards of 900 millions; Mr. Wallace, of Edinburgh, conjectured it might amount to 1000 millions, and this number has since generally been adopted who have noticed the subject;" ''The Monthly Magazine'' 4 (July&amp;ndash;December 1797), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0S0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 167].&lt;/ref&gt; More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;600 million: Simon Gray, ''The Happiness of States'' (1818), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ue5eAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA356  p. 356].
800 million:  Gordon Hall, Samuel Newell, ''The Conversion of the World'' (1818), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzA3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA10  p. 10].
800 to 1000 million: John Redman Coxe, ''Considerations Respecting the Recognition of Friends in Another World'' (1845), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl9IAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 21] (footnote with references).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3% to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;"Even recent demographic data is accurate only from 3 to 5%, although in demography traditionally more digits are indicated than those having a meaning. This is partially due to the ethical difficulty in rounding off numbers that supposedly represent real people, officially counted during a census." Sergei P Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''Physics-Uspekhi'' 39(1) 57-71 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. A number of factors contributed to this increase, including the lessening of the [[mortality rate]] in many countries by improved sanitation and [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]], and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm |title=The limits of a Green Revolution? |publisher=BBC News|date=March 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/19525.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422210924/http://www.energybulletin.net/19525.html |archivedate=April 22, 2008 |title=The Real Green Revolution |publisher=Energybulletin.net |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|title=World Population to 2300|format=PDF|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|date=2004|accessdate= June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html |title=International Programs |publisher=USCB |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. Globally, the population [[population growth|growth rate]] has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East, and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Nielsen|date=2006|title=The Little Green Handbook|publisher=Picador|place=New York|isbn= 0-312-42581-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fertility rate world map 2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of countries by fertility rate (2018), according to [[CIA World Factbook]]
]]

During the 2010s, Japan and some countries in [[Europe]] began to encounter [[negative population growth]] (i.e. a [[Net (economics)|net]] decrease in population over time), due to [[sub-replacement fertility]] rates.&lt;ref name=BigDecline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/9999591/Japans-population-suffers-biggest-fall-in-history.html|title=Japan's population suffers biggest fall in history|work=Daily Telegraph|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013|location=London|first=Danielle|last=Demetriou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global [[demographic transition]]. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf |title=2006 report highlights|format=PDF |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=UN population estimates and projections, database query, August 2009 |publisher=United Nations |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' "most likely scenario" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Randers, Jorgen|date=2012|title=2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years|publisher=Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Raftery, a [[University of Washington]] professor of statistics and of sociology, states that "there’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the world’s agenda, remains a very important issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/18/world-population-to-keep-growing-this-century-hit-11-billion-by-2100/ World population to keep growing this century, hit 11 billion by 2100].

Using the above figures, the change in population from 2010 to 2015 was:

*World: +420 million
*Africa: +142 million
*Asia: +223 million
*Europe: +3 million
*Latin America and Caribbean: +35 million
*Northern America: +14 million
*Oceania: +2.9 million

===Projections===
{{Main|World population estimates|Projections of population growth}}
Long-term global population growth is difficult to predict. The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates – according to the UN, the world population reached seven billion in late 2011,&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_highlights.pdf |title=World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision |publisher=[[Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat]]|format=PDF|date=June 2009|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popwnote.html | publisher = US Census Bureau | title = Notes on the World POPClock and World Vital Events|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.

Average global [[birth rate]]s are declining fast, but vary greatly between developed countries (where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels) and developing countries (where birth rates typically remain high). Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates. [[Death rate]]s can change rapidly due to [[Infectious disease#Mortality from infectious diseases|disease epidemics]], [[List of wars|wars]] and other mass catastrophes, or [[Life extension|advances in medicine]].

2012 United projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate; the global population is expected to reach between 8.3&amp;nbsp;and 10.9&amp;nbsp;billion by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm |title=World Population Prospects, the 2012 Revision – "Low variant" and "High variant" values|publisher=UN|date=2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45165|title= World population projected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 – UN report|publisher=UN News Centre|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003 [[United Nations Population Division|UN Population Division]] population projections for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion.&lt;ref name=LongRangeProjections2003KeyFindings&gt;{{Cite book |date=2003 |chapter=Key Findings |title=Long-Range Population Projections |work=Proceedings of the United Nations Technical Working Group on Long-Range Population Projections |place=New York |publisher=United Nations: Department of Economic and Social Affairs |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange/longrangeKeyFind.pdf |accessdate=July 3, 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130404072923.htm |title=A model predicts that the world's populations will stop growing in 2050 |publisher=ScienceDaily.com |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 9.3 and 12.6 billion in 2100, and continued growth thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/18/world-population-new-study-11bn-2100|title=World population to hit 12bn in 2100 – with 70% chance of continuous rise|author=Carrington, Damien|first=|date=September 18, 2014|work=The Guardian|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| publisher  = AAAS| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

==Mathematical approximations==
In 1975, [[Sebastian von Hoerner]] proposed a formula for population growth which represented [[hyperbolic growth]] with an infinite population in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sebastien von Hoerner|title=Population Explosion and Interstellar Expansion|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|issue=28|date=1975|pages=691–712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance → increase in the [[carrying capacity]] of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=37484&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'']. [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' For a rigorous mathematical analysis of this issue, see [https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0496 "A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE – 1973 CE"].&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the [[demographic transition]].

According to the Russian demographer [[Sergey Kapitsa]],&lt;ref name=Kapitza&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sergei P. |last=Kapitsa |url=http://srs.dl.ac.uk/SPEAKERS/KAPITZA/Uspekhi_96.html |title=The phenomenological theory of world population growth |journal=Physics-Uspekhi |volume=39 |number=1 |pages=57–71 |date=1996 |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511041230/http://srs.dl.ac.uk/SPEAKERS/KAPITZA/Uspekhi_96.html |archivedate=May 11, 2009 |doi=10.1070/pu1996v039n01abeh000127|bibcode=1996PhyU...39...57K }}&lt;/ref&gt; the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt; N = \frac{C}{\tau} \arccot \frac{T_0-T}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''N'' is current population
* ''T'' is the current year
* ''C'' = (1.86±0.01)·10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2007±1
* &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; = 42±1

===Years for world population to double===
According to linear interpolation and extrapolation of [[world population estimates|UNDESA population estimates]], the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the [[2nd millennium]], each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6635/full/387803a0.html |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Lutz |first2=Warren |last2=Sanderson |first3=Sergei |last3=Scherbov |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803–805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23 |issue=6635 |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictions of scarcity===
[[File:Los Angeles Aerial view 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]] lies on a coastal mediterranean [[savannah]] with a small [[Drainage basin|watershed]] that is able to support at most one million people on [[water scarcity|its own water]]; as of 2015, the area has a population of over 18 million. Researchers predict that similar cases of resource scarcity will grow more common as the world population increases.&lt;ref name=BeddWarn/&gt;]]
In his 1798 work ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', the British scholar [[Thomas Malthus]] incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable [[utopian]] ideas of [[William Godwin]] and [[Marquis de Condorcet]], as presented in ''[[Political Justice]]'' and ''[[The Future Progress of the Human Mind]]''. In 1968, [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] reprised Malthus' argument in ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', predicting that mass global [[famine]] would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/23/paul-ehrlich-global-collapse-warning|title=Paul Ehrlich, a prophet of global population doom who is gloomier than ever|work=The Guardian|date=October 23, 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2013|location=London|first=Juliette|last=Jowit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predictions of Ehrlich and other [[Neo-malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]] were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably [[Julian Lincoln Simon]], and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the [[Green Revolution]], forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kindall, Henery W |author2=Pimentel, David |last-author-amp=yes|title=Constraints on the Expansion of the Global Food Supply |journal=Ambio |volume=23 |issue=3 |date=May 1994 |url= http://dieoff.org/page36.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm|title=The limits of a Green Revolution?|publisher=BBC News|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neo-Malthusians point out that [[fossil fuel]]s provided the energy for the Green Revolution, in the form of natural gas-derived [[fertilizers]], oil-derived [[pesticides]], and [[hydrocarbon]]-fueled [[irrigation]], and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/eigenbr.htm|title=Host Plant Resistance and Conservation of Genetic Diversity|work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook|publisher=University of Minnesota|date= March 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[InterAcademy Panel]] [[IAP statement on population growth|Statement on Population Growth]], which was ratified by 58 member [[national academy|national academies]] in 1994, states that "unprecedented" population growth aggravates many environmental problems, including rising levels of [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]], [[global warming]], and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |title=IAP (login required) |publisher=InterAcademies.net |accessdate=February 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203604/http://www.interacademies.net/?id=3547 |archivedate=February 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment.&lt;ref name=TIMEenvir&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2097720_2097782_2097814,00.html |title=Overpopulation's Real Victim Will Be the Environment|work=TIME|date=October 26, 2011|accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The situation has continued to worsen, as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.

===Population control===
{{main|Human population planning}}
[[File:India - Chennai - busy T. Nagar market 1 (3059480968).jpg|thumb|India is predicted to overtake China as the world's most populous country by 2022.]]
Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's [[birth rate]], by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], and [[religion|religious reasons]]. The use of [[abortion]] in some population control strategies has caused controversy,&lt;ref&gt;Some population control programs, such as China's [[one-child policy]], entail the use of forced late-term abortions, sparking domestic anger and international condemnation: {{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/world/la-fg-china-abortions-20120616 |title=China one-child policy leads to forced abortions, mothers' deaths|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 15, 2012|accessdate= August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with religious organizations such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20081208_xlii-world-day-peace_en.html |title=Fighting poverty to build peace|publisher= [[Holy See|Vatican]]|date=January 1, 2009|accessdate= October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Nebraska]] publication ''Green Illusions'' argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that "Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehmer|first=Ozzie|title=Green lllusions|date=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska|location=Lincoln and London|page=188|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Fatal Misconception'' by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CwImmRvyyiEC|title=Fatal Misconception: The Struggle to Control World Population|author=Connelly, Matthew|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press via [[Google Books]]|isbn=9780674029835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World population milestones''' were unnoticed until the 20th  century, since there were no reliable data on [[global population]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaclav Smil, [http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/mgs/5-2-smil.pdf "Global Population: Milestones, Hopes, and Concerns"], ''Medicine &amp; Global Survival'', October 1998; Vol. 5, No. 2, 105–108&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.&lt;ref name=UN7bn&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643 |title=Population seven billion: UN sets out challenges|date=26 October 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-10-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024–2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035–2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.&lt;!--Please don't cull these references. Readers need to see the resources for themselves, to see such things as prediction variation, stability, and source. If you are of a mind to do something, just elaborate on the text and spread the references out. It's what I'd do if I had the time, but this exercise has used up as much time as I can spare--&gt;&lt;ref name=WorldPopProspects&gt;

==Global billionth milestones==
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the [[United States Census Bureau]] places them in July 1959 and April 1974.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Five billion===
'''The Day of Five Billion''', 11 July 1987, was designated by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] as the approximate day on which [[world population]] reached five billion.  '''Matej Gašpar''' from [[Zagreb]], Croatia (then [[SR Croatia]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on [[Earth]].  The honor went to Zagreb because the [[1987 Summer Universiade]] was taking place in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ankica Barbir-Mladinović|title=Petomilijarditi "Zemljanin": Ne slušati stereotipe|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/petomilijarditi_zemljanin_ne_slusati_stereotipe/24269206.html|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB123EF931A25754C0A961948260|title=And Baby Makes Five billion: U.N.

===Six billion===
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] designated 12 October 1999 as the approximate day on which the [[world population]] reached six billion.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/19991012/aponline181217_000.htm |title=World Population Hits 6 billion| author=Edith M. Lederer| date=12 October 1999| accessdate=12 October 2010|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was officially designated '''The Day of Six Billion'''.  Demographers do not universally accept this date as being exact.  In fact there has been subsequent research which places the day of six billion nearer to 18 June or 19 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~galen/popclk.html |title=Population Clock}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Programs division of the United States Census Bureau estimated that the world population reached six billion on 21 April 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  United Nations Population Fund spokesman Omar Gharzeddine disputed the date of the Day of Six Billion by stating, "The U.N. marked the '6 billionth' [person] in 1999, and then a couple of years later the Population Division itself reassessed its calculations and said, actually, no, it was in 1998."&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Boyle, Science Editor, NBC News |url=http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/28/8525681-7-billion-people-how-do-they-know |title=Cosmic Log – 7 billion people?

On the Day of Six Billion, [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] was in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina to monitor the [[Dayton Agreement]].&lt;ref name="unsgt2204"/&gt; At midnight he went to Koševo Hospital, where '''Adnan Mević''', born at 12.01&amp;nbsp;am, was named the symbolic 6 billionth concurrently alive person on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name="unsgt2204"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19991014.sgt2204.doc.html|title=The Secretary-General, in two-day stopover in Sarajevo, confers with local leaders, United Nations Representative|date=12 October 1999|publisher=United Nations|pages=SG/T/2204|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc472704"/&gt;  He is the first son of Fatima Mević and Jasminko Mević and weighed 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="bbc472704"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/472704.stm World UN chief welcomes six billionth baby]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and regional population==
{{See also|List of population milestones by country}}
National or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to [[citizen]]s rather than [[residency (domicile)|resident]]s. Commentators in countries with high [[immigration]] have pointed out that a population milestone may be reached by an immigrant rather than [[Rate of natural increase|natural increase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-16/australias-population-reaches-24-million/7170274|title=Australia's population hits 24 million people, ABS clock shows|date=2016-02-16|work=[[ABC Online]] |quote=The ABS said it was unclear whether the 24 millionth Australian was a newborn or a migrant|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/baby-reed-is-one-in-23-million-almost/story-fngr8hax-1226627384262|title=Baby Reed is one in 23 million as Australia's population hits a milestone|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |location= Sydney, Australia |quote=He said the 23rd millionth person could be a newborn but could equally be a person coming to work in Australia or a returning backpacker who had been away for more than a year.|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero world government''' refers to a hypothetical future in which [[central government|national governments]] cease to exist or to matter, as a result of [[globalization]] and a worldwide rejection of politics, as known today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The term contrasts with that of one [[world government]] in the sense that rather than there being a world-[[state (polity)|state]], there are no political states in the world.
