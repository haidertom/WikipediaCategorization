      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8835">[[File:Everyone has Influenza - The Round of Doctors and Druggists.jpg|thumb|300px|The January 12, 1890, edition of the Paris satirical magazine ''[[Le Grelot]]'' depicted an unfortunate influenza sufferer bowled along by a parade of doctors, druggists, skeleton musicians and dancing girls representing [[quinine]] and [[antipyrine]]]] 
The '''1889–1890 flu pandemic''' (October 1889 – December 1890, with recurrences March – June 1891, November 1891 – June 1892, winter 1893–1894 and early 1895) was a deadly [[influenza pandemic]] that killed about 1 million people worldwide. The outbreak was dubbed "Asiatic flu" or "Russian flu" (not to be confused with the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1#Russian flu|1977–1978 epidemic]] caused by Influenza A/USSR/90/77 [[H1N1]], which was also called Russian flu). For some time the virus strain responsible was conjectured (but not proven) to be [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2]].{{sfn|Hilleman|2002|p=3068}}{{sfn|Madrigal|2010}} More recently, the strain was asserted to be [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N8]].{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

==Outbreak and spread==
Modern transport infrastructure assisted the spread of the 1889 influenza. The 19 largest European countries, including the [[Russian Empire]], had 202,887&amp;nbsp;km of railroads and transatlantic travel by boat took less than six days (not significantly different than current travel time by air, given the time scale of the global spread of a pandemic).{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

The pandemic was first recorded in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia in December 1889. In four months it had spread throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Deaths peaked in Saint Petersburg on December 1, 1889, and in the United States during the week of January 12, 1890. The median time between the first reported case and peak mortality was five weeks.{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}

==Identification of virus subtype responsible==
Researchers have tried for many years to identify the subtypes of [[Influenza A]] responsible for the 1889–1890, 1898–1900 and [[1918 flu pandemic|1918]] epidemics. Initially, this work was primarily based on "seroarcheology"—the detection of antibodies to influenza infection in the sera of elderly people—and it was thought that the 1889–1890 pandemic was caused by Influenza A subtype H2, the 1898–1900 epidemic by subtype H3, and the 1918 pandemic by subtype H1.{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=820}} With the confirmation of [[H1N1]] as the cause of the [[1918 flu pandemic]] following identification of H1N1 antibodies in exhumed corpses,{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=821}} reanalysis of seroarcheological data has indicated that Influenza A subtype H3 (possibly the [[H3N8]] subtype), is the most likely cause for the 1889–1890 pandemic.{{sfn|Valleron|Cori|Valtat|Meurisse|2010|}}{{sfn|Dowdle|1999|page=825}}

They noted that raw food eaten by the patient may have been contaminated by rats. In 1955, Mackerass and Sanders identified the lifecycle of the worm in rats, defining snails and slugs as the intermediate hosts and noting the path of transmission through the blood, brain, and lungs in rats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Epidemiology and pathogenesis==
Following World War II, ''A. cantonensis'' spread throughout Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Islands, including [[Australia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]]. Cases were soon reported in [[New Caledonia]], the [[Philippines]],  [[Rarotonga]], [[Saipan]], [[Sumatra]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Tahiti]]. In the 1960s, even more cases were reported from the region from locations such as [[Cambodia]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Java]], [[Thailand]], [[Sarawak]], [[Vietnam]], and the New Hebrides ([[Vanuatu]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|title=EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS|last=|first=|date=2018-03-09|website=louisiana.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214313/http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-15|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study of eosinophilic meningitis in humans was conducted by Rosen, Laigret, and Bories, who hypothesized that the parasite causing these infections was carried by fish. However, Alicata noted that raw fish was consumed by large numbers of people in Hawaii without apparent consequences, and patients presenting with meningitis symptoms had a history of eating raw snails or [[prawn]]s in the weeks before presenting with symptoms. This observation, along with epidemiology and [[autopsy]] of infected brains, confirmed ''A. cantonensis'' infection in humans as the cause of the majority of eosinophilic meningitis cases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=J.E.|title=The discovery of Angiostrongylus cantonensis as a cause of human eosinophilic meningitis|journal=Parasitology Today|volume=7|issue=6|pages=151–153|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(91)90285-v|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the parasite has been shown to be proliferating at an alarming rate due to modern food-consumption trends and global transportation of food products. Scientists are calling for a more thorough study of the epidemiology of ''A. cantonensis'', stricter food-safety policies, and the increase of knowledge on how to properly consume products commonly infested by the parasite, such as snails and slugs that act as intermediate hosts or those that act as [[Host (biology)#Paratenic hosts|paratenic hosts]], such as fish, frogs, or [[Fresh water|freshwater]] prawns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lv S, Zhang Y, Steinmann P, Zhou XN | title = Emerging angiostrongyliasis in Mainland China | language = en-us | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–4 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18258099 | pmc = 2600175 | doi = 10.3201/eid1401.061529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=Joseph E.|date=1967|title=Effect of Freezing and Boiling on the Infectivity of Third-Stage Larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis Present in Land Snails and Freshwater Prawns|jstor=3276839|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1064–1066|doi=10.2307/3276839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ash|first=Lawrence R.|date=1968|title=The Occurrence of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in Frogs of New Caledonia with Observations on Paratenic Hosts of Metastrongyles|jstor=3277060|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=54|issue=3|pages=432–436|doi=10.2307/3277060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingestion of food items that can be contaminated by the mucus excretions of intermediate or paratenic hosts, such as snails and slugs or by the feces of rats that act as definitive hosts, can lead to infection of ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards CS, Merritt JW | title = Studies on Angiostrongylus cantonensis in molluscan intermediate hosts | journal = The Journal of Parasitology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 382–8 | date = April 1967 | pmid = 6022396 | doi = 10.2307/3276595 | jstor = 3276595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common route of infection of  ''A. cantonesis'' in humans is by ingestion of either intermediate or paratenic hosts of the [[larva]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell BG, Little MD | title = The finding of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in rats in New Orleans | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–73 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 3275136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unwashed fruits and vegetables, especially [[romaine lettuce]], can be contaminated with snail and slug mucus or can result in accidental ingestion of these intermediate and paratenic hosts.

==Pathogenesis of human angiostrongylosis==
The presence of parasitic worms burrowed in the neural tissue of the human [[central nervous system]] will cause obvious complications. All of the following will result in damage to the CNS:{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

# Direct mechanical damage to neural tissue from the worms' motion
# Toxic byproducts such as nitrogenous waste
# [[Antigen]]s released by dead and living parasites

==Eosinophilic meningitis==
{{See also|Eosinophilic meningitis}}
Although the clinical disease caused by ''Angiostrongylus'' invasion into the central nervous system is commonly referred to as "eosinophilic meningitis", the actual pathophysiology is of a meningoencephalitis with invasion not just of the [[meninges]], or superficial lining of the brain, but also deeper brain tissue. Initial invasion through the lining of the brain, the meninges, may cause a typical inflammation of the meninges and a classic meningitis picture of headache, stiff neck, and often fever. The parasites subsequently invade deeper into the brain tissue, causing specific localizing [[Neurological disorder|neurologic]] symptoms depending on where in the brain [[parenchyma]] they migrate. Neurologic findings and symptoms wax and wane as initial damage is done by the physical in-migration of the worms and secondary damage is done by the inflammatory response to the presence of dead and dying worms. This inflammation can lead in the short term to paralysis, bladder dysfunction, visual disturbance, and coma and in the long term to permanent nerve damage, mental retardation, nerve damage, permanent brain damage, or death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang QP, Lai DH, Zhu XQ, Chen XG, Lun ZR | title = Human angiostrongyliasis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 621–30 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18922484 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70229-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eosinophilic meningitis is commonly defined by the increased number of [[eosinophil]]s in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). In most cases, eosinophil levels rise to 10 or more eosinophils per μl in the CSF, accounting for at least 10% of the total CSF [[White blood cell|leukocyte]] (white blood cell) count.&lt;ref name="urlwww.dhh.louisiana.gov"&gt;[http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf "EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS"]. Revised 28 February 2006, accessed 1 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical analysis of the CSF typically resembles the findings in "[[aseptic meningitis]]" with slightly elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and negative bacterial cultures. Presence of a significantly decreased glucose on CSF analysis is an indicator of severe [[meningoencephalitis]] and may indicate a poor [[Prognosis|medical outcome]]. Initial CSF analysis early in the disease process may occasionally show no increase of eosinophils, only to have classical increases in eosinophils in subsequent CSF analysis. Caution should be advised in using eosinophilic meningitis as the only criterion for diagnosing angiostrongylus infestation in someone with classic symptoms, as the disease evolves with the migration of the worms into the CNS.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eosinophils are specialized white blood cells of the [[Granulocyte|granulocytic]] cell line which contain granules in their [[cytoplasm]]. These granules contain proteins that are toxic to parasites. When these granules degranulate, or break down, chemicals are released that combat parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Eosinophils, which are located throughout the body, are guided to sites of inflammation by [[chemokine]]s when the body is infested with parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Once at the site of inflammation, type 2 cytokines are released from [[T helper cell|helper T cells]], which communicate with the eosinophils, signaling them to activate. Once activated, eosinophils can begin the process of [[degranulation]], releasing their toxic [[protein]]s in the fight against the foreign parasite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Clinical signs and symptoms===
According to a group [[case study]], the most common symptoms in mild eosinophilic meningitis tend to be headache (with 100% of people in the study suffering from this symptom), [[photophobia]] or visual disturbance (92%), neck stiffness (83%), fatigue (83%), [[hyperesthesia]]s (75%), vomiting (67%), and [[paresthesia]]s (50%).&lt;ref name="Murphy 35–40" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Incubation period]] is often 3 weeks, but can be 3–36 days&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and even 80 days.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng YT, Tsai HC, Sy CL, Lee SS, Wann SR, Wang YH, Chen JK, Wu KS, Chen YS | title = Clinical manifestations of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis: 18 years' experience in a medical center in southern Taiwan | journal = Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection = Wei Mian Yu Gan Ran Za Zhi | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21524976 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.01.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
The diagnosis of disease caused by ''A. cantonensis'' infestation is often difficult and relies heavily on the history of a likely ingestion of a commonly infested host and the presence of typical features of the disease. The presumptive diagnosis is particularly strong when eosinophilic meningoencephalitis can be confirmed. The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis can be arrived at through detection of elevated cranial pressure and increased numbers of eosinophils. The diagnosis of the cause of eosinophilic meningitis and the presence of ''A. cantonensis'' is remarkably more difficult. A [[Lumbar puncture|spinal tap]], or a sample of CSF, must be taken to search for ''A. cantonensis'' worms or larvae. ''A. cantonensis'' is undetectable in the CSF of more than half of the infected individuals. Current methods of detecting specific antigens associated with ''A. cantonensis'' are also unreliable. Consequently, alternative approaches to detect antigen-[[antibody]] reactions are being explored, such as [[Agglutination-PCR|immuno-PCR]].&lt;ref name="urlImmuno-PCR for Detection of Antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis Circulating Fifth-Stage Worms -- Chye et al. 50 (1): 51 -- Clinical Chemistry"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chye SM, Lin SR, Chen YL, Chung LY, Yen CM | title = Immuno-PCR for detection of antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis circulating fifth-stage worms | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14709636 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.020867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid dot-blot [[ELISA|ELISA test]] is also available for quick, effective, and economical on-site diagnosis of  ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eamsobhana P, Yong HS | title = Immunological diagnosis of human angiostrongyliasis due to Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Nematoda: Angiostrongylidae) | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–31 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19117782 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.09.021 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971208016834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''boundaries between the continents''' of [[Earth]] are generally a matter of [[geography|geographical]] convention.  Several slightly different conventions are in use.  The number of [[continent]]s is most commonly considered seven but may range as low as four when the [[Americas]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]] are each considered a single continent.  According to the definition of a continent in the strict sense, an [[island]] cannot be part of any continent, but by convention and in practice most major islands are associated with a continent.

There are three overland boundaries subject to definition:

* between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (dividing [[Eurasia]]): along the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Urals]] (historically also north of the Caucasus, along the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] or along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]])
* between Asia and [[Africa]] (dividing Afro-Eurasia into Africa and [[Eurasia]]): at the [[Isthmus of Suez]]
* between [[North America]] and [[South America]] (dividing the [[Americas]]): the [[Isthmus of Panama]]
While the isthmus between Asia and Africa and that between North and South America are today navigable, via the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals, respectively, diversions and canals of human origin generally are not accepted on their own accord as continent-defining boundaries; the  Suez Canal happens to traverse the [[isthmus]] between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Red Sea]], dividing Asia and Africa. The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:

* the delineation of [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Australasia]] (part of [[Oceania]]) in the [[Ceram Sea]], [[Arafura Sea]], [[Timor Sea]], [[Halmahera Sea]], and [[Malay Archipelago]]
* the delineation between Africa, Europe and Asia in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]
* the delineation between Asia and Europe in the [[Arctic Ocean]]
* the delineation between Europe and North America in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
* the delineation between North and South America in the [[Caribbean Sea]]
* the delineation of Asia from North America in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]

==Europe and Africa==
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|The Mediterranean sea, between Africa &amp; Europe]]
[[File:Makaronesia.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Atlantic Ocean around the boundary]]
The [[Europea]]n and [[Africa]]n mainlands are non-contiguous, and the delineation between these continents is thus merely a question of which islands are to be associated with which continent. At its nearest point, [[Morocco]] and the European portion of [[Spain]] are separated by only {{convert|8.1|mi|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.

The Portuguese Atlantic island possession of the [[Azores]] is {{convert|1368|km|abbr=on}} from Europe and {{convert|1507|km|abbr=on}} from Africa, and is usually grouped with Europe if grouped with any continent. By contrast, the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Madeira]] islands off the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]] are much closer to, and usually grouped with, Africa (the Canary Islands are only {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast at their closest point, while Madeira is {{convert|520|km|abbr=on}} from Africa and {{convert|1,000|km|abbr=on}} from Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225123213/http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}; {{cite web|url=http://listofafricancountries.com |title=Countries of Africa |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean island nation of [[Malta]] is approximately {{convert|81|km|abbr=on}} from the coast of Sicily in Europe - much closer than the {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}} distance to the closest African coast.  The nearby Italian island of [[Lampedusa]] is {{convert|207|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily while just {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast;  similarly, [[Pantelleria]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily and just {{convert|71|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.  All of these Mediterranean islands are actually located on the [[African Plate|African plate]], and may be considered part of the continent of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa-arabia-plate.weebly.com/|title=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|website=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM|title=African Plate|website=www.uwgb.edu|access-date=2016-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145431/https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM#|archive-date=6 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for political and historical reasons, maps generally display them as part of Europe.

==Europe and Asia==
The boundary between Europe and Asia is unusual among continental boundaries because of its largely mountain-and-river-based characteristics north and east of the Black Sea. The reason is historical, the division of Europe and Asia going back to the early [[Greek geographers]].
In the modern sense of the term "continent", [[Eurasia]] is more readily identifiable as a "continent", and Europe has occasionally been described as a [[subcontinent]] of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Slomp |title=Europe: A Political Profile |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22european+subcontinent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SYCYoz-m3V&amp;sig=zCy9OfV_frpcoJH0acUWF8JGX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWUNVKlrx9qgBPmZgbAM&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22european%20subcontinent%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Historical Europe-Asia boundaries 1700 to 1900.png|thumb|upright|Conventions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The red line shows the most common modern convention, in use since {{circa|1850}} (see [[#Modern definition|below]]).
{{legend|#fcf9ea|Europe}}
{{legend|#d2d0c5|Asia}}
{{legend|#edfb9d|historically placed in either continent}}]]
The threefold division of the [[Old World]] into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to [[Greek geographers]] such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. 

Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus (from its mouth by [[Poti]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, through the [[Surami Pass]] and along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Herodotus+Phasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g8qiTbXZNtCVOuPjjDU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Phasis&amp;f=false p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt;
As geographic knowledge of the Greeks increased during the [[Hellenistic period]],&lt;ref&gt;according to Strabo (''[[Geographica]]'' 11.7.4) even at the time of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], "it was agreed by all that the Tanais river separated Asia from Europe" ({{lang|grc|ὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀπὸ
τῆς Εὐρώπης ὁ Τάναϊς ποταμός}}; c.f. Duane W. Roller, ''Eratosthenes' Geography'', Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-691-14267-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8peKyWK_SWsC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Eratosthenes+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdGiTeTEEY7rObCruTU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eratosthenes%20Tanais&amp;f=false p. 57])
&lt;/ref&gt; this archaic convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;
W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;

''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178)) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]],  the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (known in antiquity as the Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130417143618/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E.

===Modern definition===

]]
The modern border between Asia and Europe remains a historical and cultural construct, defined only by convention. The modern border follows the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]]-[[Sea of Marmara]]-[[Bosphorus]] (together known as the [[Turkish Straits]]), the [[Black Sea]], along the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Greater Caucasus]], the northwestern portion of the [[Caspian Sea]] and along the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Kara Sea]], as mapped and listed in most atlases including that of the [[National Geographic Society]] and as described in the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=9th|year=2011|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-0634-4}} "Europe" (plate 59); "Asia" (plate 74): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] both have most of their territory in Asia, although each has small parts of their northern borderlands north of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}} Azerbaijan: Geography and Georgia: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most geographic sources assign the area south of the Caucasus Mountain crest to [[Southwest Asia|Southwest or West Asia]],&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100270/Caucasus |title=Caucasus |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification. Cultural influences in the area originate from both Asia and Europe. While geographers rarely define continents primarily politically, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and to a lesser extent [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are increasingly in the 21st century politically oriented towards Europe, but Armenia has a great cultural diaspora to the south, and Azerbaijan shares a cultural affinity with [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] as well as with the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;Thomas De Waal.

The Turkish city [[Istanbul]] lies in on both sides of the Bosporus (one of the Turkish Straits), making it a transcontinental city. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] are transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia by any definition except that of Eurasia as a single continent. While Russia is historically a European country with a history of [[Russian Empire|imperial conquests]] in Asia, the situation for Turkey is inverse, as that of an Asian country with [[Ottoman Empire|imperial conquests]] in Europe. [[Kazakhstan]] is also a transcontinental country by this definition, its [[West Kazakhstan Province|West Kazakhstan]] and [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] provinces extending on either side of the Ural River.&lt;ref name="Factbook-Ural"&gt;{{Cite book | title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}} Kazakhstan: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ural River bridge in [[Orenburg]] is even labeled with permanent monuments carved with the word "Europe" on one side, "Asia" on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katjasdacha.com/whiterose/thoughts/orenburg/orenburg3.html|title=Orenburg bridge monument photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] (more precisely, the [[Manych River]], the [[Kuma–Manych Canal]] and the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]]) remains cited less commonly as one possible natural boundary in contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'' (2011) s.v. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324715/Kuma-Manych-Depression "Kuma-Manych Depression"]: "It is often regarded as the natural boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; This definition peaked in prominence in the 19th century, however it has declined in usage since then, as it places traditionally European areas of Russia such as  [[Stavropol]], [[Krasnodar]], and even areas just south of [[Rostov-on-Don]] in Asia.

A lesser known definition for country grouping, is the definition used for statistical purposes by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* listed as part of [[Eastern Europe]]: [[Russian Federation]]
* listed as part of [[Central Asia]]: [[Kazakhstan]]
* listed as part of [[Western Asia]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Turkey]]
 
According to UNSD, the aforementioned "assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |title=Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the UNSD classification often differs from those of other [[United Nations]] organizations. For instance, while UNSD includes Georgia and Cyprus in Western Asia, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]  and [[UNESCO]] include both countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=west+asia+iran+2015&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWGRVanpKqOy7Qb1tqP4Bw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20asia%20iran%202015&amp;f=false United Nations Industrial Organisation] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/unesco-regions/europe-and-north-america/ Europe and North America], Retrieved: 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
[[Cyprus]] is an island of the Mediterranean located close to [[Asia Minor]], so that it is usually associated with Asia and/or the [[Middle East]], as in the [[World Factbook]] and the [[United Nations geoscheme]], but the [[Republic of Cyprus]] was nevertheless admitted to the Council of Europe in 1961 and joined the EU in 2004.  The northern part of the island functions as the unrecognized (except by Turkey) [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

The Greek [[Aegean Islands|North Aegean Islands]] and the [[Dodecanese]] lie on the coast of the Asian part of Turkey (on the Asian continental shelf).

==Europe and North America==
Europe and North America are separated by the [[North Atlantic]].
In terms of associating islands with either continent, the boundary is usually drawn between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The Norwegian islands of [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] are usually associated with Europe. Iceland and the [[Azores]] are protrusions of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and are associated with and peopled from Europe, even though they have areas on the [[North American Plate]].  (Definitions of "continents" are a physical and [[cultural construct]] dating back centuries, long before the advent or even knowledge of [[plate tectonics]]; thus, defining a "continent" falls into the realm of physical and cultural geography, while continental plate definitions fall under plate tectonics in the realm of [[geologists|geology]].)

===Islands===
The geographical notion of a [[continent]] stands in opposition to islands and archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[:continent#Noun|continent]] on [[Wiktionary]]. "from Latin ''continent-, continens'' 'continuous mass of land, mainland'" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continent?show=1&amp;t=1301917145 merriam-webster.com])&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are some islands that are considered part of Europe in a political sense.
This most notably includes the [[British Isles]] (part of the European continental shelf and during the Ice Age of the continent itself), besides the islands of the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] which are part of the territory of a country situated on the European mainland, and usually also the [[island state]]s of [[Iceland]] and [[Malta]].

Russia's [[Vaygach Island]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]] extend northward from the northern end of the [[Ural Mountains]] and are a continuation of that chain into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. While Novaya Zemlya was variously grouped with Europe or with Asia in 19th-century maps it is now usually grouped with Europe, the continental boundary considered to join the Arctic Ocean along the southern shore of the [[Kara Sea]]. The Russian Arctic [[archipelago]] of [[Franz Josef Land]] farther north is also associated with Europe.

Europe ends in the west at the [[Atlantic Ocean]], although Iceland and the [[Azores]] archipelago (in the Atlantic, between Europe and North America) are usually considered European, as is the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. [[Greenland]] is geographically part of North America, but politically associated with Europe as it is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], although it has extensive home rule and EU law no longer applies there.

==Africa and Asia==
[[File:TransAfrica.PNG|thumb|
{{legend|#FF0000|African part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFA500|Asian part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFFF00|Rest of Asia}}
{{legend|#C0C0C0|Rest of Africa}}]]

Historically in [[Greco-Roman geography]], "Africa" meant [[Ancient Libya]], and its eastern extent was taken to be around [[Marmarica]], at the ''[[Catabathmus Magnus]]'', placing [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in Asia entirely.
The idea of Egypt being an "African" country seems to develop in around the mid-19th century;{{CN|date=August 2016}} the term  ''Africa'' was classically reserved for what is now known as the [[Maghreb]], to the explicit exclusion of Egypt, but with the [[exploration of Africa]] the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's "natural" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent.  In 1806, [[William George Browne]] still titled his travelogue ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria''. Similarly, [[James Bruce]] in 1835 published ''Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia''. On the other hand,
as early as 1670  [[John Ogilby]] under the title ''Africa'' published ''"an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, Æthiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto"''.

The usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the [[Isthmus of Suez]], the narrowest gap between the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Gulf of Suez]], the route today followed by the [[Suez Canal]]. This makes the [[Sinai Peninsula]] geographically Asian, and [[Egypt]] a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of Egyptian population live in the Sinai, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an [[African country]] entirely and not partly Asian.

But when discussing the geopolitical region of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]], Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the [[Middle East]], while Egypt's western neighbor [[Libya]] is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the [[Maghreb]]. However, they are both members of the [[Arab League]] as well as the [[African Union]].

The [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Comoros]] are island nations in the [[Indian Ocean]] associated with Africa. The island of [[Socotra]] may be considered African as it lies on this continent's shelf, but is part of [[Yemen]], an Asian country.

{{Further|Americas|Central America}}

===Mainland===
The border between North America and South America is at some point on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the [[Serranía del Darién|Darién Mountains]] watershed divide along the [[Colombia]]-Panama [[Colombia–Panama border|border]] where the isthmus meets the South American continent.  Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within [[North America]] and/or [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/mapping/outline-map/?map=Panama |title=National Geographic Education |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas (list)|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2010|page=4}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New Geographical Dictionary (list and map)|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.|year=1984|pages=856, 859}}&lt;br&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas "Americas"] ''Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)'', United Nations Statistics Division&lt;br&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view "North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303000000/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view |date=3 March 2008 }} ''Atlas of Canada''&lt;br&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
Often most of the [[Caribbean islands]] are considered part of North America, but [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] lie on the [[continental shelf]] of South America. On the other hand, the Venezuelan [[Isla Aves]] and the Colombian [[San Andrés and Providencia]] lie on the North American shelf.

==Asia and North America==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[Bering Strait]] and [[Bering Sea]] separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the [[Diomede Islands]] in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the US. The [[Aleutian Islands]] are an island chain extending westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward Russia's [[Komandorski Islands]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost [[Near Islands]] group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the [[North Aleutians Basin]] and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] to be considered a transcontinental state.

[[St. Lawrence Island]] in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the [[Rat Islands]] in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] are separated by only {{convert|2.5|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=off}}.

==The Americas and Oceania==
The [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[Malpelo Island]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean are possessions of [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], respectively, and associated with South America. The uninhabited French possession of [[Clipperton Island]] {{convert|600|mi|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=off}} off the Mexican coast is associated with North America.

[[Easter Island]], a territory of [[Chile]], is considered to be in Oceania, though politically it is associated with South America.

The United States of America controls numerous territories in Oceania, including the state of [[Hawaii]] and the territories of [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[American Samoa]].

==Asia and Oceania==
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Wallace Line|Wallace]], [[Lydekker line|Lydekker]] and [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber]] Lines, the principals on [[Wallacea]] ]]
The [[Malay Archipelago]] is usually divided between Asia and [[Australasia]], most commonly along the anthropologic Melanesian line or [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]]. Indonesia controls the western half of [[New Guinea]], geographically part of Australasia. The eastern half of the island is part of [[Papua New Guinea]] which is considered to be part of Oceania. Indonesia is  commonly referred to as one of the [[Asia#SouthEast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. [[East Timor]], an independent state that was formerly a territory of Indonesia, which is geographically part of Asia, is classified by the [[United Nations]] as part of the "South-Eastern Asia" block. It is [[ASEAN Summit#East Timor|expected to join]] the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/east-timor-asean-bid/2006/07/22/1153166635002.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=East Timor ASEAN bid | date=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been involved as an ASEAN Regional Forum member since independence, and has participated in the [[Southeast Asian Games]] since [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|2003]]. Occasionally, all of the [[Malay Archipelago]] is included in Oceania, although this is extremely rare, especially as most of the archipelago lies on the Asian continental shelf.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] includes [[List of islands of Australia#External Territories|island possessions in Oceania]] and islands closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland.

==Antarctica==
Antarctica along with its outlying islands have no permanent population. All land claims south of 60°S latitude are held in abeyance by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].

The [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are closer to Antarctica than to any other continent. However, they are politically associated with the inhabited [[Falkland Islands]] which are closer to South America. Furthermore, Argentina, a South American country, maintains its [[irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the islands. The continental shelf boundary separates the two island groups.

The [[Prince Edward Islands]] are located between Africa and Antarctica, and are the territory of South Africa, an African country.  The Australian [[Macquarie Island]] and the New Zealand [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell Islands]], are all located between the [[Oceania]]n countries of Australia and New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;!-- see [[Talk:Transcontinental country#New Zealand|discussion]] --&gt;

Australia's [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the French [[Kerguelen Islands]] are located on the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], on the Antarctic continental plate. The French [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Amsterdam]], [[Île Saint-Paul]], and the Norwegian [[Bouvet Island]] are also located on the Antarctic continental plate, and are not often associated with other continents.

'''''Bryum argenteum''''', the '''silvergreen bryum moss''' or '''silvery thread moss''',&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{PLANTS|id=BRAR71|taxon=Bryum argenteum|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of [[moss]] in the family [[Bryaceae]]. It is one of the most common urban mosses of inner cities and can be easily recognized without a microscope.
[[file:A living car.jpg|thumb|''B. argenteum'' growing in the cracks of a car window]]

==Description==
The species is silvery-green or whitish-green colored when dry. This is because the broadly ovate shaped single leaflets in the tip do not form [[chlorophyll]]. The costa extends beyond the middle of the leaf. In damp, undisturbed locations, the branches may also form a more horizontal growth habit. The upper cells of the leaf surface are elongated rhomboid shaped. The capsule of the sporophyte is short cylindrical, appears broader at the base and is dark red to black colored.&lt;ref name=il&gt;http://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/mosses/plants/silver_moss.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a high ability to tolerate drought and pollution of urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://pza.sanbi.org/bryum-argenteum&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. argenteum'' is considered a desiccation tolerant species that can withstand total drying. While it is a common characteristic in mosses, ''B. argenteum'' was one of the first [[bryophytes]] experimentally determined to be desiccation tolerant.&lt;ref name=gao2017&gt;Gao B, Li X, Zhang D, et al. Desiccation tolerance in bryophytes: The dehydration and rehydration transcriptomes in the desiccation-tolerant bryophyte Bryum argenteum. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1):7571. Published 2017 Aug 8. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-07297-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
An adaptable plant, it has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] and is found in Europe, North America, the deserts of [[Australia]] and in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=AOLA&gt;{{cite web |title=Bryum argenteum|work=Atlas of Living Australia|url=https://bie.ala.org.au/species/http://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/ausmoss/10062136|accessdate= October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web|title=The cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum in Antarctica: recent colonisation or in situ survival?|author=S. Pisa, E. M. Biersma, P. Convey, J. Patiño, A. Vanderpoorten, O Werner, R. M. Ros|work=Springer Link - Polar Biology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-014-1537-3|accessdate=October 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612122250/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00300-014-1537-3|archive-date=2018-06-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It thrives in areas of high anthropogenic activity, growing on rocks, in gaps of paving stones, on asphalt, and on roadsides. It grows especially well in inner cities or in industrial areas. Being a nitrogen loving species, it is also found on nitrophilic soils in urban areas.  It is found growing among lawns as well as in other moss communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/bbs/activities/mosses/Bryum%20argenteum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The species is often spread by vegetative fragments clinging to the shoes of people and the feet or hooves of animals.&lt;ref name=il/&gt;
Another method of spread is in the production and sale of [[liners]]. Liners infested with ''B. argentem'', often in association with ''[[Marchantia polymorpha]]'', are commonly grown in one region of the country, transported to another region to continue growth, and are shipped to a retail location before being planted. Plants have the potential to pick up or disperse these species at each point of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/13/1/35.full.pdf|title=Controlling Liverwort and Moss Now and in the Future| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], a [[taxon]] is said to have a '''cosmopolitan distribution''' if its [[range (biology)|range]] extends across all or most of the world in appropriate [[habitat]]s. Such a taxon is said to exhibit cosmopolitanism or cosmopolitism. The opposite extreme is [[endemism]].

==Related terms and concepts==
The term '''pandemism''' also is in use, but not all authors are consistent in the sense in which they use the term; some speak of pandemism mainly in referring to diseases and [[pandemic]]s, and some as a term intermediate between endemism and cosmopolitanism, in effect regarding pandemism as '''subcosmopolitanism'''. This means near cosmopolitanism, but with major gaps in the [[species distribution|distribution]], say, complete absence from Australia.&lt;ref name="Simpson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G. Simpson|title=Plant Systematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C&amp;pg=PA720|date=19 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092208-9|pages=720–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperServais2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

==Aspects and degrees==
The term "cosmopolitan distribution" usually should not be taken literally, because it often is applied loosely in various contexts. Commonly the intention is not to include polar regions, extreme altitudes, oceans, deserts, or small, isolated islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKTeiqPBpM4C&amp;pg=PA164|date=15 July 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1324-6|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[housefly]] is nearly as cosmopolitan as any animal species, but it is neither oceanic nor polar in its distribution.&lt;ref name="RussellOtranto2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C. Russell|author2=Domenico Otranto|author3=Richard L. Wall|title=The Encyclopedia of Medical and Veterinary Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QfhF_wQSV4C&amp;pg=PA157|year=2013|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-78064-037-2|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "cosmopolitan weed" implies no more than that the plant in question occurs on all continents except [[Antarctica]]; it is not meant to suggest that the species is present in all regions of every continent.

==Oceanic and terrestrial==
Another concept in [[biogeography]] is that of [[Oceanography|oceanic]] cosmopolitanism and endemism. Although there is a temptation to regard the [[World Ocean]] as a medium without biological boundaries, this is far from reality; many physical and biological barriers interfere with either the spread or continued residence of many species. For example, temperature gradients prevent free migration of tropical species between the Atlantic and Indian-plus-Pacific oceans, even though there is open passage past continental masses such as the Americas and Africa/Eurasia. Again, as far as many species are concerned, the [[Southern Ocean]] and the Northern marine regions are completely isolated from each other by the intolerable temperatures of the tropical regions. In the light of such considerations, it is no surprise to find that endemism and cosmopolitanism are quite as marked in the oceans as on land.

==Ecological delimitation==
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is that of ecological limitations. A species that is apparently cosmopolitan because it occurs in all oceans might in fact occupy only [[littoral zone|littoral zones]], or only particular ranges of depths, or only [[Estuary|estuaries]], for example. Analogously, [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] species might be present only in forests, or mountainous regions, or sandy [[arid]] regions or the like. Such distributions might be patchy, or extended, but narrow. Factors of such a nature are taken widely for granted, so they seldom are mentioned explicitly in mentioning cosmopolitan distributions.

==Regional and temporal variation in populations==
Cosmopolitanism of a particular species or variety should not be confused with cosmopolitanism of higher taxa.  For example, the family [[Antlion|Myrmeleontidae]] is cosmopolitan in the sense that every continent except Antarctica is home to some indigenous species within the Myrmeleontidae, but nonetheless no one species, nor even genus, of the Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan. Conversely, partly as a result of human introduction of unnatural [[Beekeeping|apiculture]] to the New World, ''[[western honey bee|Apis mellifera]]'' probably is the only cosmopolitan member of its family; the rest of the family [[Apidae]] have modest distributions.

Even where a cosmopolitan population is recognised as a single species, such as indeed ''Apis mellifera'', there generally will be variation between regional sub-populations. Such variation commonly is at the level of [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], whereas some variation is too slight or inconsistent for formal recognition.

For an example of subspecific variation, consider the so-called "[[Africanized bee|African killer bee]]", which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera scutellata]]'', and the [[African bee|Cape bee]], which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera capensis]]''; both of them are in the same cosmopolitan species ''Apis mellifera'', but their ranges barely overlap.

Other cosmopolitan species, such as the [[osprey]] and [[house sparrow]], present similar examples, but in yet other species there are less familiar complications: some migratory birds such as the [[Arctic tern]] occur from the Arctic to the [[Southern Ocean]], but at any one season of the year they are likely to be largely in passage or concentrated at only one end of the range. Also, some such species breed only at one end of the range. Seen purely as an aspect of cosmopolitanism, such distributions could be seen as temporal, seasonal variations.

Other complications of cosmopolitanism on a planet too large for local populations to interbreed routinely with each other, lead to genetic effects such as [[ring species]], for example in the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.&lt;ref name="Kunz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kunz|title=Do Species Exist: Principles of Taxonomic Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQxwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=2 August 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-66426-9|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also lead to the formation of [[Cline (biology)|clines]] such as in [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name="KrimbasPowell1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Costas B. Krimbas|author2=Jeffrey R. Powell|title=Drosophila Inversion Polymorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PLSPhg3KPGgC&amp;pg=PA23|date=21 August 1992|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-6547-8|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and modern==

Cosmopolitan distributions can be observed both in extinct and extant species. For example, ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' was cosmopolitan in the Early Triassic after a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M. J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, the [[killer whale]] has a cosmopolitan distribution, extending over most of the Earth's [[ocean]]s. The wasp ''[[Copidosoma floridanum]]'' is another example, as it is found around the world. Other examples include [[human]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[orchid]]s, the foliose [[lichen]] ''[[Parmelia sulcata]]'', and the [[Mollusca|mollusc]] genus ''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]''.&lt;ref name="Spellerberg"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ian F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9499">The '''Countess of Dufferin Fund''' was established by [[Hariot Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava]], more commonly known as Lady Dufferin, in 1885 and was dedicated to improving women’s healthcare in [[India]].  The Fund was founded after [[Queen Victoria]] gave Lady Dufferin the task of improving healthcare for women in India.  The Fund provided scholarships for women to be educated in the medical field as doctors, hospital assistants, nurses, and [[midwives]].  It also financed the construction of female hospitals, dispensaries, and female only wards in preexisting hospitals.  The Fund marks the beginning of Western medicine for women in India and global health as a diplomatic concern.

== History of the Fund ==

=== Background ===

During the 19th century there was a major push in India to improve healthcare for women, especially maternal health.  [[Lying-in]] hospitals were built as well as training and teaching hospitals.  Many hospitals were also constructing wards for women and learning to treat female-specific diseases.&lt;ref name=Abraham&gt;Abraham, Meera. Religion, Caste, and Gender: Missionaries and Nursing History in South India. Bangalore: B.I. Publications Pvt., 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===

In 1885, Lady Dufferin set up the Fund after being contacted by Queen Victoria who gave her the task of helping the suffering women of India.  Queen Victoria had been recently contacted by [[Elizabeth Bielby]], a missionary in India who focused on women’s health.  During Beilby’s mission, she had treated the Maharani of Puna who gave her a message to relay to the Queen of England.  The message said that “the women of India suffer when they are sick.”  In response, Queen Victoria wrote back to the Maharani saying: {{quotation|“We had no idea it was as bad as this.  Something must be done for the poor creatures.  We wish it generally known that we sympathize with every effort to relieve the suffering of the women of India.”&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt;}}  Lady Dufferin then started the Fund after being summoned to [[Windsor Castle]] by the Queen who gave her the task of improving healthcare and education for the women of India.&lt;ref name=Nightengale&gt;Nightingale, Florence. "The Condition of Women in India." Florence Nightingale on Social Change in India. Ed. Lynn McDonald and Gérard Vallée. Waterloo, Ont.: Wilfrid Laurier UP, 2007. 717-21. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  A visit from Dr. [[Mary Scharlieb]], the first female British doctor to practice in India, also mobilized the Queen to act on women’s poor health and suffering in India.  She met with Queen Victoria and expressed a similar message as the Maharni’s: the dire situation of Indian women.

=== Establishment ===

Lady Dufferin established the Fund in 1885 and immediately began creating projects and channeling money towards women’s health and teaching in India.  The Countess of Dufferin Fund is also known as “The National Association for Supplying Medical Aid to the Women of India” and the “Lady Dufferin Fund.”  This Fund marked one of the first diplomatic pushes to improve global health in the world, and the introduction of western medicine for women in India.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Forbes, Geraldine Hancock. Women in Colonial India: Essays on Politics, Medicine, and Historiography. N.p.: Orient Blackswan, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fund’s goals ==

The Fund had three primary goals: providing medical tuition, medical relief, and female nurses and midwives to assist in hospitals and private homes.&lt;ref name=Billington&gt;
Billington, Mary Frances.'' Woman in India''. Delhi, India: Sri Satguru Publications, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund supplied scholarships for the medical education (medical tuition) of women in India.  The education of traditional Indian midwives, called dias, was a major goal of the Fund because many western doctors observed the dais’s practices and found their traditions to be harmful.&lt;ref name=Guha&gt;Guha, Supriya, Dr. "Midwifery in Colonial India." Welcome History. N.p., 13 Mar. 2012. Web. 15 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the dais’s would massage the abdomen of the mother to speed up labor however that tradition caused [[uterine prolapse]], a widespread issue amongst Indian women at the time.  Because the dias’ methods were viewed as violent and extremely harmful, the Fund put forth money to educate them on successful ways to help women before, during, and after childbirth.  The Fund also provided medical relief by establishing dispensaries and cottage hospitals for women and children under female superintendence.&lt;ref name=Billington/&gt;  In addition, it opened female wards in existing hospitals also under female management as well as all women hospitals called [[zenana missions|zenana]] hospitals.  The Fund also supplied trained female nurses and midwives in hospitals and in private homes.

== Projects ==

The Fund financed treatment and teaching hospitals in [[Bihar]], [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], [[Karachi]], [[Delhi]], [[Bombay]] and in many of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (roughly present day Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand).&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt; Most notably, the Fund sponsored the [[Lady Aitchison Hospital]] in [[Lahore]], India.&lt;ref name=Abraham/&gt;  The Lady Aitchison Hospital, also known as the Aitchison Memorial Hospital, was a major center for training nurses and tradition midwives like the dias.  Many of the hospitals the Fund financed are still functioning today.  For example, the [[Lady Dufferin Hospital]] in Karachi is the largest solely female dedicated hospital today in Pakistan.

== Funding and Administration ==

The Fund’s major financial basis was donations.  Many saw this as a source of instability because donations were based on the popularity of Lady Dufferin and her husband as well as the favors expected by the donors in return.  The administration of the Fund consisted of a central committee of members of the Viceroy’s Council and Home Department.  It also included many influential Englishmen and Indians such as the Maharja Sir Jotendro Mohun Tagore, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, and Sir [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]].&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;

== Criticism of the Fund ==

There were three major criticisms of the Fund: its teaching, effectiveness, and integrity.  Many believed the Fund was inefficient.  Some argued that they inadequately taught doctors and employed subpar medical practitioners.&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;Conrad, Lawrence I., and Anne Hardy. "Western Feminism, Western Medicine, and Colonial Medical Practice." Women and Modern Medicine. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001. 42-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  By October 1908, only 43 completely qualified women medical professionals were working under the Fund however only 11 held university degrees.&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;Vaughan, Kathleen O. "The Countess of Dufferin's Fund." The British Medical Journal (1908): 1219-220. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Medical Journal]] wrote in 1908 that, “The Government appears to have a perfect delight in swamping the country with unqualified medical practitioners."&lt;ref name=Vaughan/&gt;  The Fund was also criticized as ineffective for placing male doctors in Zenana hospitals.  Zenana women’s traditions forbade them from seeing, so they could be treated by the doctors the Fund provided.  In addition, the Fund was also criticized for not giving the women they were educating enough reason to stay with learning medicine.  The Fund paid for their education however their salaries were not high enough so it made more financial sense for the women to marry before they could give back to the hospital that educated them.  The Fund set up this cycle of educating women who would then work for them, however, it was ineffective in some cases because the women would not stick with the medical profession for financial reasons.  Because of the many criticisms of ineffectiveness, some of the Fund’s highest critics like The British Medical Journal called for a reorganization of the Fund.  Some also believed vanity, not philanthropy, was the source of motivation for establishing the Fund.&lt;ref name=Conrad/&gt;  They criticized both Lady Dufferin for starting the Fund for her personal image and Queen Victoria for supporting the Fund for Britain’s international image.

== After Lady Dufferin ==

The Fund continued even after Lady Dufferin’s term ended.  Lady Lansdowne, who succeeded Lady Dufferin, continued to put work into the Fund which was passed down from vicereine to vicereine until 1947.&lt;ref name=Nightengale/&gt;  In 1947, India gained independence from Great Britain and the Fund was taken over by the Central Indian Government by the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund Act, 1957.  Once the Fund was taken over by the Central Government, it became obsolete.  In 2005 a bill was passed repealing the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund Act, 1957, for unclear reasons.&lt;ref name=GOVERNMENT&gt;"GOVERNMENT BILLS: Discussion On The Countess Of Dufferin'S Fund ... on 5 December 2002."

'''Dependency theory''' is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".

The theory arose as a reaction to [[modernization theory]], an earlier [[development theory|theory of development]] which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of [[poverty]] is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as [[investment]], [[technology transfer]]s, and closer integration into the [[World economy|world market]]. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm|date=14 July 2009}}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory no longer has many proponents as an overall theory, though some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1997|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink2=Paul James (academic)|title=Post-Dependency: The Third World in an Era of Globalism and Late Capitalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/7311042/Post-Dependency_The_Third_World_in_an_Era_of_Globalism_and_Late_Capitalism|journal=Alternatives: Social Transformation and Human Governance|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949 – one by [[Hans Singer]], one by [[Raúl Prebisch]] – in which the authors observe that the [[terms of trade]] for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer [[Final good|manufactured goods]] from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis|Prebisch–Singer thesis]]. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|United Nations Commission for Latin America]] (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of [[protectionism]] in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substitution industrialisation]] (ISI), not a [[Export-oriented industrialization|trade-and-export orientation]], was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;Short [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm Prebisch biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812085123/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm |date=2009-08-12 }} at Newschool; retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] perspective by [[Paul A. Baran]] in 1957 with the publication of his ''The Political Economy of Growth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matias Vernengo|url=http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|title=Technology, Finance and Dependency: Latin American Radical Political Economy in Retospect|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317085658/http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2012|year=2004|page=5}}Working Paper No. 2004-06, University of Utah Dept. of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of [[imperialism]] by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, [[Celso Furtado]], and [[Aníbal Pinto Santa Cruz|Aníbal Pinto]] at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by [[Paul A. Baran]], [[Paul Sweezy]], and [[Andre Gunder Frank]].

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian [[Walter Rodney]], in his book ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'', described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, W. (1972). How Europe underdeveloped Africa. Beyond borders: Thinking critically about global issues, 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. It was used to explain the causes of [[overurbanization]], a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.&lt;ref name=Shandra&gt;Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. "Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis." Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (1 September 2003): 309–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Structuralist and the American Marxist schools had significant differences but agreed on some basic points:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology &lt;span role="presentation"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; the Promethean force unleashed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the [[international division of labour]] – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baran placed surplus extraction and [[capital accumulation]] at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new [[means of production]] – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in [[Colonialism|colonial times]], most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special [[tariff]] protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign [[shareholder]]s as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or "dependent development"&amp;ndash;development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at [[industrialisation]] in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent.&lt;ref&gt;So, Alvin Y. 1990. Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory. Newbury Park, London and New Delhi: Sage Publications
&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] has argued that constraints placed on development by [[neoliberalism]] were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O'Donnell, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;G O'Donnell, ''El Estado Burocrático Autoritario: Triunfos, Derrotas y Crisis'', Buenos Aires, Universidad de Belgrano, written 1982, published 1996, cited in Vernengo, ''Technology, Finance and Dependency'', p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[multinational corporation]]s and state promotion of technology were emphasised by the Latin American Structuralists.

Fajnzybler has made a distinction between systemic or authentic competitiveness, which is the ability to compete based on higher productivity, and spurious competitiveness, which is based on low wages.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Vernengo, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debt of developing countries|third-world debt]] crisis of the 1980s and continued stagnation in Africa and Latin America in the 1990s caused some doubt as to the feasibility or desirability of "dependent development".&lt;ref&gt;Vernengo, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sine qua non'' of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries&amp;ndash;particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international [[reserve currency]] &amp;ndash; the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. He believes that the end of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international financial agreements]] in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States' position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

"Standard" dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a "new dependency", which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (in office 1995&amp;ndash;2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:
*there is a financial and technological penetration by the developed capitalist centers of the countries of the periphery and semi-periphery;
*this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;
*this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
*this favors the appearance of specific patterns of [[Social class|class]] relations;
*these require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee both the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso &amp; Faletto, 1979, cited in Tausch, ''Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession'', about 1/6 of way through.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of development patterns in the 1990s and beyond is complicated by the fact that capitalism develops not smoothly, but with very strong and self-repeating ups and downs, called cycles. Relevant results are given in studies by Joshua Goldstein, Volker Bornschier, and Luigi Scandella.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the economic growth of India and some East Asian economies, dependency theory has lost some of its former influence. It still influences some [[NGO]] campaigns, such as [[Make Poverty History]] and the [[fair trade]] movement.

==Other theorists and related theories==
Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were [[François Perroux]] and [[Kurt W. Rothschild|Kurt Rothschild]]. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, [[Walden Bello]], Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, [[Keith Griffin (economist)|Keith Griffin]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], Paul Israel Singer, and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; the leading dependency theorist in the Islamic world is the Egyptian economist [[Samir Amin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tausch|first=Arno|date=2003|title=Social Cohesion, Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession to the European Union: Implications from a Global Model|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|volume=2|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|via=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004744/http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on works of Amin from 1973 to 1997, lists the following main characteristics of periphery capitalism:
#Regression in both agriculture and small scale industry characterizes the period after the onslaught of foreign domination and colonialism
#Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade &lt; 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)
#These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
#Chronic current account balance deficits, re-exported profits of foreign investments, and deficient business cycles at the periphery that provide important markets for the centers during world economic upswings
#Structural imbalances in the political and social relationships, inter alia a strong '[[wikt:comprador|compradore]]' element and the rising importance of state capitalism and an indebted state class&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form [[world-systems theory]]. This postulates a third category of countries, the ''semi-periphery'', intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London|pages=169-199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tausch&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist [[Karl Polanyi]] after the [[World War I|First World War]], but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

Dependency theory has also been associated with [[Johan Galtung]]'s structural theory of imperialism.

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative [[current account]] balances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. [[Giovanni Arrighi]] believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is argued that, at this stage, the role of [[unequal exchange]] in the entire relationship of dependency cannot be underestimated.{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} Unequal exchange is given if double factorial terms of trade of the respective country are &lt; 1.0 (Raffer, 1987, Amin, 1975).

The former ideological head of the [[Blekingegade Gang]] and political activist [[Torkil Lauesen]] argues in his book ''The Global Perspective'' that political theory and practice stemming from dependency theory are more relevant than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Lauesen, Torkil. ''The Global Perspective: Reflections on Imperialism and Resistance''. Montreal: Kersplebedeb, 2018. p. 321ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulates that the conflict between countries in the core and countries in the periphery has been ever-intensifying and that the world is at the onset of a resolution of the core-periphery contradiction – that humanity is "in for an economic and political rollercoaster ride".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economic policies based on dependency theory has been criticized by [[Free market|free-market]] economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Martin Wolf]] and others:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Zinkina J.

*Lack of competition: by subsidizing in-country industries and preventing outside imports, these companies may have less incentive to improve their products, to try to become more efficient in their processes, to please customers, or to research new innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michelle|title=The End of the Developmental State?|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415854822|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sustainability: industries reliant on government support may not be sustainable for very long, particularly in poorer countries and countries which largely depend on foreign aid from more developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*Domestic opportunity costs: subsidies on domestic industries come out of state coffers and therefore represent money not spent in other ways, like development of domestic infrastructure, seed capital or need-based social welfare programs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} At the same time, the higher prices caused by tariffs and restrictions on imports require the people either to forgo these goods altogether or buy them at higher prices, forgoing other goods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of [[India]]'s economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited (''see also'' [[economy of India]], ''[[The Commanding Heights]]''). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as [[outsourcing]] – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] provide another example of trade-based development vs. autocratic self-sufficiency. Following the Korean War, North Korea pursued a policy of [[import substitution industrialization]] as suggested by dependency theory, while South Korea pursued a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] as suggested by comparative advantage theory. In 2013, South Korea's per capita GDP was 18 times that of North Korea. In Africa, states which have emphasized import-substitution development, such as [[Zimbabwe]], have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent's most successful non-oil based economies, such as [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], and [[Tunisia]], have pursued trade-based development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/whats_driving_africas_growth&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory's claims are "debatable", and that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

The '''Earth System Governance Project'''&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/Earth-System-Governance_Science-Plan.pdf] Biermann, Frank, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, [[Diana Liverman]], Heike Schroeder, and Bernd Siebenhüner, with contributions from Ken Conca, Leila da Costa Ferreira, Bharat Desai, Simon Tay, and Ruben Zondervan. 2009. ''Earth System Governance: People, Places and the Planet. Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project''. Earth System Governance Report 1, IHDP Report 20. Bonn, IHDP: The Earth System Governance Project.&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-term, interdisciplinary social science research programme originally developed under the auspices of the [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]].&lt;ref name="IHDP"&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/publications/?id=325] IHDP Annual Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It started in January 2009.

The Earth System Governance Project currently consists of a network of ca. 300 active and about 2,300 indirectly involved scholars from all continents. The project has evolved into the largest social science research network in the area of governance and global environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=9446496&amp;jid=JPS&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=9446492] John Dryzek. 2014. Institutions for the Anthropocene: Governance in a Changing Earth System. ''British Journal of Political Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth System Governance Project Office is hosted at Lund University, Sweden.

== Aims ==
The Earth System Governance Project aims to contribute to science on the large, complex challenges of governance in an era of rapid and large-scale environmental change. The project seeks to create a better understanding of the role of institutions, organizations and governance mechanisms by which humans regulate their relationship with the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; The Earth System Governance Project aims to integrate governance research at all levels. The project aims to examine problems of the ‘global commons’, but also local problems from [[air pollution]] to the preservation of waters, [[waste treatment]] or [[desertification]] and [[soil degradation]]. However, due to natural interdependencies local environmental pollution can be transformed into changes of the global system that affect other localities. Therefore, the Earth System Governance Project looks at institutions and governance processes both local and globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futureearth.org/blog/2013-jul-15/what-earth-system-governance] What is Earth System Governance?&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth System Governance Project is a scientific effort, but also aims to assist policy responses to the pressing problems of earth system transformation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/Managing-global-change/Earth-System-Governance-Project/] The Broker Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cri.cn/6966/2011/05/19/1461s638279.htm] Nobel Laureates Hand in Recommendations to UN Panel on Global Sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual framework ==
{{Main|Earth system governance}}
The Earth System Governance Project organizes its research according to a conceptual framework guided by five analytical problems. These are the problems of the overall ''architecture'' of earth system governance, of ''agency'' beyond the state and of the state, of the ''adaptiveness'' of governance mechanisms and processes, of their ''accountability'' and legitimacy and of modes of ''allocation and access'' in earth system governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agci.vu.nl/en/Images/Biermann%20et%20al%20%202010%20INEA%20ESG%20Research%20Framework_tcm143-191335.pdf] Frank Biermann, Michele M. Betsill, Joyeeta Gupta, Norichika Kanie, Louis Lebel, Diana Liverman, Heike Schroeder, Bernd Siebenhüner and Ruben Zondervan. 2010. Earth system governance: a research framework. ''International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law, and Economics''. Vol 10. Nr 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''concept of Earth System Governance''' is defined as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''... the interrelated and increasingly integrated system of formal and informal rules, rule-making systems, and actor-networks at all levels of human society (from local to global) that are set up to steer societies towards preventing, mitigating, and adapting to global and local environmental change and, in particular, earth system transformation, within the normative context of sustainable development''.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin and history ==
In 2001, the four then active global change research programmes [[Diversitas|(DIVERSITAS]], [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]], [[World Climate Research Programme]], and [[International Human Dimensions Programme|International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change]]) agreed to intensify co-operation through setting up an overarching [[Earth System Science Partnership]]. The research communities represented in this Partnership contend in the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41] The Amsterdam Declaration on Global Change&lt;/ref&gt; that the earth system now operates ‘well outside the normal state exhibited over the past 500,000 years’ and that ‘human activity is generating change that extends well beyond natural variability—in some cases, alarmingly so— and at rates that continue to accelerate.’ To cope with this challenge, the four global change research programmes have called ‘urgently’ for strategies for Earth System management’.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt;

In March 2007, in response to the 2001 Amsterdam Declaration, the Scientific Committee of the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), the overarching social science programme in the field, mandated the drafting of the Science Plan of the Earth System Governance Project by a newly appointed Scientific Planning Committee. The Earth System Governance Project builds on the results of an earlier long-term research programme, the IHDP core project Institutional Dimensions of Global Environmental Change (IDGEC).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dsj1rkoH3scC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=HDP+core+project+Institutional+Dimensions+of+Global+Environmental+Change+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NXxIhAHHT2&amp;sig=uHwEdIOQzkkkMQdI7e-kmI0b4Mw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zr-TVdXiLYq5UYWNrBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=HDP%20core%20project%20Institutional%20Dimensions%20of%20Global%20Environmental%20Change%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Peijun Shi, Carlo Jaeger, Qian Ye (editors). 2012. ''Integrated Risk Governance: Science Plan and Case Studies of Large-scale Disasters''. Heidelberg: Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/publication/young-oran--institutions-and-environmental-change] Young, Oran., Heike Schroeder and Leslie A. King (editors). 2008. ''Institutions and Environmental Change: Principal Findings, Applications, and Research Frontiers''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Earth System Governance Project was officially launched.  

In 2009, the Science and Implementation Plan of the Earth System Governance Project was published.&lt;ref name="Biermann2009"/&gt; In the science and implementation plan, the conceptual problems, cross-cutting themes, flagship projects, and its policy relevance are outlined in detail. The Science Plan was written by an international, interdisciplinary Scientific Planning Committee chaired by Prof. Frank Biermann, which drew on a consultative process that started in 2004. Several working drafts of this Science Plan have been presented and discussed at a series of international events and conferences, and numerous scholars in the field, as well as practitioners, have offered suggestions, advice, and critique.&lt;ref name="IHDP"/&gt;

Since then, the project has evolved into a broader research alliance that builds on an international network of research centers, lead faculty and research fellows. After the termination of the IHDP in 2014, the activities of the Earth System Governance research alliance are supported by an international steering group of representatives of the main Earth System Governance Research Centres and the global group of lead faculty and research fellows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.org/people/lead-faculty Earth System Governance Project: Lead Faculty. Website accessed 1 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research network ==
For its activities and implementation, the Earth System Governance Project relies on a global network of experts from different academic and cultural backgrounds. The research network consists of different groups of scientific experts. The Earth System Governance Project operates under the direction of a ''Scientific Steering Group'' chaired by Frank Biermann. The role of the Scientific Steering Committee is to guide the implementation of the Earth System Governance Science Plan. The ''Lead Faculty'' of the Earth System Governance Project is a group of individual scientists who take over (shared) responsibility for the development of research on particular analytical problems. ''Earth System Governance Fellows'' are scientists who link their own research projects with the broader themes and questions raised by the Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan.

An important element in the project organisation is the global alliance of research centres that brings together the [[VU University Amsterdam]]; the [[Australian National University]]; [[Chiang Mai University]]; [[Colorado State University]]; [[Lund University]]; [[University of East Anglia]]; [[University of Oldenburg]]; the [[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]; the [[University of Toronto]]; the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] and [[Yale University]]. In addition, strong networks on earth system governance research exist in China, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia.

==  Education programmes ==
Earth system governance as a research object is quickly emerging, and as a consequence, the number of education programmes on bachelor, master and doctoral level related to earth system governance steadily increases. A number of institutes and universities currently collaborate in a Global Alliance of Earth System Governance Research Centres, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 29 April 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ecosystems, Resilience and Governance, University of Stockholm and Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden
* Environmental Studies and Sustainability Science, LUMES, International Master’s Programme, Lund University, Sweden
* Environment and Resource Management, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Global Environmental Governance, Specialization track in MSc Political Science, VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Lund University Centre of Excellence for Integration of Social and Natural Dimensions of Sustainability, LUCID, Research School, Lund University, Sweden
* Sustainability Economics and Management, MSc Programme, University of Oldenburg, Germany
* Environmental Governance related Programmes, MA, MSc, and PhD Programmes, Colorado State University, United States of America
* Environment and Development Programmes, MSc, MRes, and MBA Programmes, University of East Anglia, United Kingdom

A substantial number of the workshops and other events of the project are capacity-building activities. The project also organizes, endorses and provides teaching to summer schools and capacity building events and programs. In addition, members of the Scientific Steering Group and staff of the International Project Office give guest lectures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthsystemgovernance.org/teaching Earth System Governance Project: Teaching. Website accessed 2 July 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Task forces ==
The Earth System Governance Project organizes Task Forces, international networks of senior and early career scholars with a series of working groups focused on particular ideas or idea clusters. There are currently two active Task Forces:

* Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/ website Task Force on Conceptual Foundations of Earth System Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force aims to explore key concepts with regard to Earth System Governance, such as planetary boundaries, green economy, resilience and the Anthropocene. It aims to critically examine and further refine these novel governance ideas. 

* Task Force on Methodology for Earth System Governance Research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbl.nl/en/news/newsitems/2013/methodology-for-earth-system-governance-research PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;
This Task Force seeks aims to advance quantitative earth system governance research by promoting new international research collaborations, fostering interaction and dialogue among existing research projects, and developing architectures to promote the building and sharing of datasets.

== Policy influence ==
In 2011, the Earth System Governance Project launched an initiative on International Environmental Governance. This initiative aims to provide a forum for discussion of current and ongoing research on international environmental governance and the institutional framework for sustainable development, in the period leading up to the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, also known as ‘Rio + 20’. In addition, the initiative aims to target decision-makers and to contribute not just to a better understanding but also to actual improvements in international environmental governance towards an institutional framework that enables sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/blog/2011/07/guest-blog-post-earth-system-governance-initiative-international-environmental-governan The Access Initiative, Guest Blog Post: Earth System Governance Initiative on International Environmental Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

== context ==
There is widespread support for the Earth System Governance Project in the scientific community, which is reflected in the size of the research network and in various publications by experts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2585-2007.32.pdf.] Myanna Lahsen. 2007. Earth System Governance: Research in Aid of Global Environmental Sustainability. ''Global Change NewsLetter No. 70''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WIzFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=interesting+earth+system+governance+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=klDVNzhn8u&amp;sig=zIOwy73tahadMZ5OwQOooWa-QnI&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjhGahUKEwjgpM7a4qrHAhUFPBoKHVuIC10#v=onepage&amp;q=interesting%20earth%20system%20governance%20project&amp;f=false] Michael Manton and Linda Anne Stevenson. 2013. Climate in Asia and the Pacific: Security, Society and Sustainability. ''Springer Science &amp; Business Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticisms of the Earth System Governance Project have also been made. 

In an internal report of the International Human Dimensions Programme it is stated that the steering group of the Earth System Governance Project is too much dominated by experts from OECD countries. Since then, the Earth System Governance Project has actively sought ways to involve experts from different regions of the world. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/docs/Publications/ESG/ESG%20SSC-1_Minutes-clean.pdf] 1st Earth System Governance Scientific Steering Committee Meeting&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of earth system governance has also been criticized for being too top-down, for placing too much emphasis on global governance structures. According to Mike Hulme, earth system governance represents an attempt to ‘geopolitically engineer’ our way out of the climate crisis. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30139401?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] Mike Hulme. 2008. The Conquering of Climate: Discourses of Fear and Their Dissolution. ''The Geographical Journal''. Vol. 174, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He questions whether the climate is governable and argues that it is way too optimistic and even hubristic to attempt to control the global climate by universal governance regimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mikehulme.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2008-hulme-governing-and-adapting.pdf] Mike Hulme. 2008. Governing and adapting to climate.

''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers''.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the novel concept, however, has been rejected by other scholars as being too narrow and misleading &lt;ref&gt;Frank Biermann. 2014.

==Definition==
The [[Science Education Resource Center]], [[Carleton College]], offers the following description: "Earth system science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states of the Earth. Earth system science provides a physical basis for understanding the world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthsystem/nutshell/|title=Earth System Science in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
For millennia, humans have speculated how the physical and living elements on the surface of the Earth combine, with gods and goddesses frequently posited to embody specific elements. The notion that the Earth, itself, is alive was a regular theme of Greek philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Tickell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tickell |first=Crispin |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/features/2000-2009/2006/11/nparticle.2006-11-20.html |title=Earth Systems Science: Are We Pushing Gaia Too Hard? |work= 46th Annual Bennett Lecture - University of Leicester |location=London |publisher=University of Leicester |date=2006 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific interpretations of the Earth system began in the field of [[geology]], initially in the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;Fielding H. Garrison, ''An introduction to the history of medicine'', W.B. Saunders, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : The Achievements |series=History of civilizations of Central Asia |editor1-first=M.

As [[History of geology|geology developed as a science]], understanding of the interplay of different facets of the Earth system increased, leading to the inclusion of factors such as the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]], [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary geology]] and [[Biosphere|living systems]].

In many respects, the foundational concepts of Earth system science can be seen in the holistic interpretations of nature promoted by the 19th century geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596-597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945) saw the functioning of the [[biosphere]] as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, [[James Lovelock]] first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in [[feedback]] mechanisms within the Earth system. Initially named the "Earth Feedback hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kasting| first1=James| title=The Gaia Hypothesis is Still Giving Us Feedback| url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/the-gaia-hypothesis-is-still-giving-us-feedback| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/GAIA_hypothesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Gaia Hypothesis and Earth System Science |last=Schneider |first=Stephen |last2=Boston |first2=Penelope |work=University of Florida |publisher=MIT Press |date=1992 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Highfield| first1=Roger| title=Unlocking Lovelock, science's greatest maverick| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/10735286/Unlocking-James-Lovelock-sciences-greatest-maverick.html| website=The Telegraph| publisher=The Telegraph| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock later renamed it the [[Gaia hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Tickell"/&gt; and subsequently further developed the theory with American evolutionary theorist [[Lynn Margulis]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gribbon| first1=John and Mary| title=James Lovelock: In Search of Gaia| date=2009| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the field of [[systems science]] was developing across numerous other scientific fields, driven in part by the increasing availability and [[Computer performance|power]] of [[computer]]s, and leading to the development of [[climate model]]s that began to allow the detailed and interacting [[numerical weather prediction|simulation]]s of the Earth's [[weather]] and [[climate]].&lt;ref name=edwards2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edwards |first=P.N. |date=2010 |title=History of climate modelling |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.95/abstract |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |volume=2 |issue= |pages=128–139 |doi=10.1002/wcc.95 |access-date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent extension of these models has led to the development of "Earth system models" (ESMs) that include facets such as the cryosphere and the biosphere.&lt;ref name=washington2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Washington |first=W.M. |last2=Buja |first2=L. |last3=Craig |first3=A. |date=2009 |title=The computational future for climate and Earth system models: on the path to petaflop and beyond |url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1890/833 |journal=Phil.

As an integrative field, Earth system science assumes the histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at [[NASA]], where a committee called the Earth System Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104410706;view=1up;seq=3 ''Earth System Science: Overview''] (1986), and the book-length [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Earth System Science: A Closer View''] (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of Earth system science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mooney| first1=Harold| title=Evolution of natural and social science interactions in global change research programs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date=February 26, 2013| volume= 110| issue = Supplement 1, 3665-3672| pages=3665–3672| doi=10.1073/pnas.1107484110| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_1/3665.full| accessdate=7 September 2015| display-authors=etal| pmid=23297237| pmc=3586612| bibcode=2013PNAS..110.3665M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early works discussing Earth system science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the Earth system as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of Earth system science parallel to the beginnings of [[global change]] studies and programs.

== Climate science ==
[[File:Ocean &amp; Earth System.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The dynamic interaction of the Earth's [[ocean]]s, [[climate|climatological]], [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical systems]].]]
Climatology and climate change have been central to Earth system science since its inception, as evidenced by the prominent place given to climate change in the early NASA reports discussed above. The Earth's climate system is a prime example of an emergent property of the whole planetary system which cannot be fully understood without regarding it as a single integrated entity. It is also a property of the system where human impacts have been growing rapidly in recent decades, lending immense importance to the successful development and advancement of Earth system science research. As just one example of the centrality of climatology to the field, leading American climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] is the Director of one of the earliest centers for Earth system science research, the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and its mission statement reads, "the Earth System Science Center (ESSC) maintains a mission to describe, model, and understand the Earth's climate system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Michael|title=Earth System Science Center|url=http://www.essc.psu.edu/|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Gaia hypothesis==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The Gaia hypothesis posits that living systems interact with physical components of the Earth system to form a [[homeostasis|self-regulating]] whole that maintains conditions that are favourable for life. Developed initially by James Lovelock, the hypothesis attempts to account for key features of the Earth system, including the long period (several billion years) of relatively favourable climatic conditions against a backdrop of [[Sun#Main sequence|steadily increasing]] [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis has important implications for Earth system science, as noted by NASA's Director for Planetary Science, James Green, in October 2010: "Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis played a key role in the origins of what we now know as Earth system science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|first1=50th Anniversary Symposium: Seeking Signs of Life|title=Opening Keynote - 'Exobiology in the Beginning'|url=http://original.livestream.com/astrobiology50th/video?clipId=pla_89adff36-bad9-43a2-b416-29a41cb9fab1|website=livestream.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science take an interdisciplinary approach to studying systems operations on a planetary-scale,&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt; they are not synonymous with one another. A number of potential Gaian feedback mechanisms have been proposed—such as the [[CLAW hypothesis]]&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

== Education ==
Earth system science can be studied at a postgraduate level at some universities, with notable programs at such institutions as the [https://www.ess.uci.edu/ University of California, Irvine], [http://www.essc.psu.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], and [https://earth.stanford.edu/ess Stanford University]. In general education, the [[American Geophysical Union]], in cooperation with the [[Keck Geology Consortium]] and with support from five divisions within the [[National Science Foundation]], convened a workshop in 1996, "to define common educational goals among all disciplines in the Earth sciences". In its report, participants noted that, "The fields that make up the Earth and space sciences are currently undergoing a major advancement that promotes understanding the Earth as a number of interrelated systems". Recognizing the rise of this [[systems approach]], the workshop report recommended that an Earth system science curriculum be developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |title=Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education |publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214004/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Earth System Science Education Alliance was begun, and currently includes the participation of 40+ institutions, with over 3,000 teachers having completed an ESSEA course as of fall 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth System Science Education Alliance|url=http://essea.strategies.org/background.html|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

[[Image:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 3. Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem, adapted from the Silver Springs model.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). ''Environment, Power, and Society''. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]] Later work by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

'''Edward Snowden asylum in Russia''' is part of the aftermath from the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] made by [[Edward Snowden]]. On June 23, 2013, Snowden flew from Hong Kong to Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Noting that his U.S. passport had been cancelled, Russian authorities restricted him to the airport terminal. On August 1, after 39 days in the transit section, Snowden left the airport. He was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year. On August 7, 2014, six days after Snowden's one-year temporary asylum expired, his Russian lawyer announced that Snowden had received a three-year residency permit. It allowed him to travel freely within Russia and to go abroad for up to three months. Snowden was not granted permanent political asylum, which would require a separate process.

==2013==
===First contact and sequestered in the airport===
Russia first received information about Snowden when he was in Hong Kong China. At that time, they were told that a person who wanted to fight against human right violations wanted to seek asylum in Russia. In 2017, during ''[[The Putin Interviews]]'' with the Director [[Oliver Stone]], the Russian president Vladimir Putin described how Russia got involved in the Snowden saga. During that time, Rusisia did not want to get involved as it already had a strained relationship with the United states which it did not wish to exacerbate. Thereafter they learnt that Snowden was on a plane bound for Moscow, to transfer to another plane bound for Latin America. Most of this information was received through informal channels including information leaded to the press. While he was int he plane, his destination countries grew reluctant to allow him in, and Snowden was thus stuck in the transit area of [[Moscow Airport|Moscow international airport]]. While in the airport, U.S.authorities asked Russia to extradite Snowden. However this was not possible as Russia had proposed a treaty on cooperation  in legal matters, requiring mutual extradition of criminals, which U.S.  had not agreed upon. Further, United States had never extradited any Russian criminal who had taken asylum in USA, hence Snowden's extradition would have been unprecedented. Snowden had not committed a crime as per Russian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Oliver |title=The Putin Interviews (Party 2 - 2:10) |url=https://www.sho.com/the-putin-interviews |website=www.sho.com |publisher=Showtime |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Granted temporary asylum===
Snowden left the Moscow airport on August 1 after 39 days in the transit section.

In late July 2013, Lonnie Snowden said he believed his son would be better off staying in Russia, and didn't believe he would receive a fair trial in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/27/nsa-snowden-father-justice-russia Edward Snowden better off in Russia than US, his father says]." [[Associated Press]] at ''The Guardian''. July 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-October, he visited his son in Moscow, later telling the press that he was pleased with Edward's situation, and still believed Russia was the best choice for his asylum, saying he wouldn't have to worry about people "rushing across the border to render him." Lonnie Snowden commented that his son was living comfortably in Russia and found Moscow "modern and sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/world/europe/russia-snowden-dad/ Edward Snowden's father pleased with son's Moscow life]. CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, announced on October 31 that his client had found a website maintenance job at one of Russia's largest websites, but declined to identify the site. Jesselyn Radack, one of Snowden's American lawyers, said she was unaware of any new job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/nsa-leaker-edward-snowden-job-russia/story?id=20739729 |title=NSA Leaker Edward Snowden Has New Job in Russia, Lawyer Says |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about this by ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' in June 2014, ''The Guardian'' correspondent [[Luke Harding]] replied, "Kucherena is completely unreliable as a source. We [''The Guardian''] did the rounds of Russian IT companies when he made that claim last year and none of them—none of the big ones, at least—confirmed this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/art_n_ideas/article/snowden-book-and-upcoming-film-chronicle-exile/501753.html |title=Snowden Book and Upcoming Film Chronicle Exile |newspaper=The Moscow Times |date=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former CIA analyst [[Ray McGovern]], who had traveled to Russia to give Snowden a whistleblower award, said that Snowden gave no storage devices such as [[hard drive]]s or [[USB flash drive]]s to Russia or China, and had carried four blank laptops with him to Hong Kong and Moscow as a diversion. U.S. officials said they assumed that any classified materials downloaded by Snowden had fallen into the hands of China and Russia, though they acknowledged they had no proof of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/11/us-usa-security-snowden-idUSBRE99A0LK20131011 |title=Laptops Snowden took to Hong Kong, Russia were a 'diversion' |last=Hosenball |first=Mark |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an October 2013 interview, Snowden maintained that he did not bring any classified material into Russia "because it wouldn't serve the public interest." He added, "There's a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents."&lt;ref name=Risen&gt;{{cite news |last=Risen |first=James |title=Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/world/snowden-says-he-took-no-secret-files-to-russia.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, however, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that British government officials anonymously claimed to the paper that Russia and China had cracked an encrypted cache of files taken by Snowden, forcing the withdrawal of British spies from live operations.&lt;ref name="ST 14/06/15"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1568673.ece |title=British spies betrayed to Russians and Chinese |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=June 14, 2015 |first1=Tom |last1=Harper |first2=Richard |last2=Kerbaj |first3=Tim |last3=Shipman}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC also stated that their sources told them British intelligence assets had been moved as a precaution after the Snowden leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British spies 'moved after Snowden files read' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33125068 |accessdate=July 31, 2015 |work=BBC |date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Greenwald charged that the report contained fabrications and did nothing more than quote anonymous British officials; he said parts were removed from the original post without ''The Times'' saying it did so.&lt;ref name=GreenwaldInterceptSundayTimesReport&gt;{{cite news |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn |title=The Sunday Times' Snowden Story is Journalism at its Worst — and Filled with Falsehoods |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/06/14/sunday-times-report-snowden-files-journalism-worst-also-filled-falsehoods/ |accessdate=July 31, 2015 |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Snowden speaks about everything.webm|right|thumb|Edward Snowden speaks about various topics at the [[Sam Adams Award]] presentation in Moscow.]]
WikiLeaks released video of Snowden on October 11 taken during the [[Sam Adams Award]] reception in Moscow, his first public appearance in three months. Former U.S. government officials attending the ceremony said they saw no evidence Snowden was under the control of Russian security services. The whistleblower group said he was in good spirits, looked well, and still believes he was right to release the NSA documents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/1010/Edward-Snowden-back-in-the-limelight-Father-US-whistleblowers-visit-Moscow-video Edward Snowden back in the limelight?

(October 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Snowden said "people all over the world are coming to realize" that the NSA's surveillance programs put people in danger, hurt the U.S. and its economy, and "limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and associate freely" as well as putting people "at risk of coming into conflict with our own government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |title=Edward Snowden says NSA surveillance programmes 'hurt our country' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/12/edward-snowden-nsa-surveillance-wikileaks-videos |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, German lawmaker [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]] traveled to Moscow to meet with Snowden, whom he invited to testify before the German parliament to assist investigations into NSA surveillance of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s phone since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/27/obama-knew-nsa-spying-on-merkel-and-approved-it-report-says-944692234/ Obama knew of NSA spying on Merkel and approved it, report says].

Also in October, Glenn Greenwald stated that the U.S. revoked Snowden's passport while he was in transit to Latin America and threatened other countries that might offer safe passage.&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Natasha.

On December 17, 2013, Snowden wrote an open letter to the people of Brazil offering to assist the Brazilian government in investigating allegations of U.S. spying, and added that he continued to seek, and would require, asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/snowdens-open-letter-to-brazil-read-the-text/2013/12/17/9bf1342a-6727-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html |title=Snowden's open letter to Brazil: Read the text |work=The Washington Post |date=December 17, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden wrote, "Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak ... going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/17/world/americas/snowden-nsa-brazil-letter/ |title=Snowden's open letter offers to help Brazil look into NSA surveillance |publisher=CNN |date=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil had been in an uproar since Snowden revealed that the U.S. was spying on Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]], her senior advisors, and Brazil's national oil company, [[Petrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/11/world/americas/brazil-nsa/ |title=As Brazil's fury over NSA mounts, U.S. vows to work through tensions |publisher=CNN |date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseff and officials of the Brazilian foreign ministry said in response that they could not consider asylum for Snowden because they had not received any formal request.&lt;ref name=reutersbrazil121713&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/17/us-usa-security-snowden-brazil-idUSBRE9BG15920131217 |title=Brazil says not considering Snowden asylum |agency=Reuters |date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the foreign ministry said that a fax requesting asylum had been sent to the Brazilian embassy in Moscow in July but it had not been signed and could not be authenticated.&lt;ref name=BrazilianSenator&gt;{{cite news |title=Brazilian Senator Urges Asylum For Snowden |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/brazilian-senator-urges-asylum-snowden |date=December 18, 2013 |work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Miranda, the Brazilian partner of Glenn Greenwald, launched an Internet petition urging the Brazilian president to consider offering Snowden asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/brazil-says-it-is-not-considering-asylum-for-edward-snowden/ |title=Brazil says it is not considering asylum for Edward Snowden |publisher=CBS News |date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden met with Barton Gellman of ''The Washington Post'' six months after the disclosure for an exclusive interview spanning 14 hours, his first since being granted temporary asylum. Snowden talked about his life in Russia as "an indoor cat," reflected on his time as an NSA contractor, and discussed at length the revelations of global surveillance and their reverberations. Snowden said, "In terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished ... I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated."&lt;ref name="WPSnowdenInterview20131224"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gellmann |first=Barton |title=Edward Snowden, after months of NSA revelations, says his mission's accomplished |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html |accessdate=January 4, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented "I am not trying to bring down the NSA, I am working to improve the NSA ... I am still working for the NSA right now. They are the only ones who don't realize it." On the accusation from former CIA and NSA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] that he had defected, Snowden stated, "If I defected at all, I defected from the government to the public."&lt;ref name="WPSnowdenInterview20131224" /&gt; In 2014, Snowden said that he lives "a surprisingly open life" in Russia and that he is recognized when he goes to computer stores.&lt;ref name="Globo"&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2014/06/se-o-brasil-me-oferecer-asilo-aceito-diz-edward-snowden.html 'Se o Brasil me oferecer asilo, aceito', diz Edward Snowden] ''[[Rede Globo]]'' June 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[BuzzFeed]], in January 2014 an anonymous Pentagon official said he wanted to kill Snowden. "I would love to put a bullet in his head," said the official, calling Snowden "single-handedly the greatest traitor in American history." Members of the intelligence community also expressed their violent hostility. "In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American," said an NSA analyst, "I personally would go and kill him myself."&lt;ref name=Buzzfeed&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Benny |title=America's Spies Want Edward Snowden Dead |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/bennyjohnson/americas-spies-want-edward-snowden-dead |work=Buzzfeed |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A State Department spokesperson condemned the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/snowden-seeking-russian-protection-after-threats-lawyer |title=Snowden Seeking Russian Protection After Threats: Lawyer |publisher=[[Bloomberg Technology]] |date=January 21, 2014 |first=Ilya |last=Arkhipov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[Meet the Press]]'' in late January 2014, speculation arose from top U.S. officials in the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that Snowden might have been assisted by Russian intelligence,&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregory |first=David |title=January 19: Dianne Feinstein, Mike Rogers, Alexis Ohanian, John Wisniewski, Rudy Giuliani, Robert Gates, Newt Gingrich, Andrea Mitchell, Harold Ford Jr., Nia-Malika Henderson |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/54117257/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/january-dianne-feinstein-mike-rogers-alexis-ohanian-john-wisniewski-rudy-giuliani-robert-gates-newt-gingrich-andrea-mitchell-harold-ford-jr-nia-malika-henderson/#.UuCqh_ZMFFR |work=Meet The Press |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting a rare interview during which Snowden spoke in his defense.

In late January 2014, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. attorney general]] [[Eric Holder]], in an interview with [[MSNBC]], indicated that the U.S. could allow Snowden to return from Russia under negotiated terms, saying he was prepared to engage in conversation with him, but that full [[clemency]] would be going too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/edward-snowden-nsa-plea-bargain-russia |title=US hints at Edward Snowden plea bargain to allow return from Russia |date=January 23, 2014 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, he appeared on video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q&amp;A exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications. Putin replied, "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country."&lt;ref&gt;(April 17, 2014), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2014/04/17/snowden-asks-putin-do-you-spy.html Snowden Asks Putin: Do You Spy?] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Wittes in ''[[The New Republic]]'' described the exchange as "a highly-scripted propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web |last=Wittes |first=Benjamin |title=Edward Snowden Is Russia's Puppet Now |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117449/edward-snowdens-embarrassing-appearance-vladimir-putins-show |work=New Republic |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden insisted his question was designed to hold the Russian president accountable.&lt;ref name=GuardianPutinTV&gt;{{cite news |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |title=Edward Snowden defends decision to question Vladimir Putin on surveillance |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/edward-snowden-defends-decision-question-vladimir-putin-on-surveillance |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |newspaper=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed for ''The Guardian'', Snowden said his question was intended "to mirror the now infamous exchange in US Senate intelligence committee hearings between senator Ron Wyden and the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA collected records on millions of Americans, and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion." Snowden called Putin's response "evasive".&lt;ref name=PutinCalledToAccount&gt;{{cite news |last=Snowden |first=Edward |title=Vladimir Putin must be called to account on surveillance just like Obama |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/18/vladimir-putin-surveillance-us-leaders-snowden |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |newspaper=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, ''The Daily Beast'' reported that Snowden himself "instantly regretted" asking Putin the "softball question", which was crafted with several of his key advisers, and that he was mortified by the reaction. [[ACLU]] attorney [[Ben Wizner]], one of Snowden's closest advisers, told the ''Beast'' that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. "I know this is hard to believe," Wizner acknowledged. "I know if I was just watching from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast2"&gt;Noah Shachtman (April 20, 2014), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/20/snowden-s-camp-staged-putin-q-a-was-a-screw-up.html Snowden's Camp: Staged Putin Q&amp;A Was a Screw-Up] ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, "Yeah, that was terrible!

And in the United States, what I did appearing at that Putin press conference was not worth the price."&lt;ref name=nationinterview&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vanden Heuvel |first1=Katrina |last2=Cohen |first2=Stephen F. |title=Edward Snowden: A 'Nation' Interview |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/186129/snowden-exile-exclusive-interview |work=The Nation |date=October 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the international advocacy group [[European Digital Rights]] (EDRi) said that the European Parliament, in adopting a Data Protection Reform Package, rejected amendments that would have dropped charges against Snowden and granted him asylum or refugee status.&lt;ref name="EDRi"&gt;(March 12, 2014) [http://edri.org/european-parliament-votes-data-protection-reform-report-mass-surveillance/ European Parliament votes on the Data Protection Reform and the report on Mass surveillance].

In May 2014, [[NBC]]'s [[Brian Williams]] presented the first interview for American television.&lt;ref name=BoingBoingFirstAmericanInterview&gt;{{cite web |last=Jardin |first=Zeni |title=NBC airs Edward Snowden's first US TV interview |url=http://boingboing.net/2014/05/28/nbc-airs-brian-williams-interv.html |work=BoingBoing |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, ''The Washington Post'' reported that during his first year of Russian asylum, Snowden had received "tens of thousands of dollars in cash awards and appearance fees from privacy organizations and other groups," fielded inquiries about book and movie projects, and was considering taking a position with a South African foundation that would support work on security and privacy issues. "Any moment that he decides that he wants to be a wealthy person," said Snowden's attorney Ben Wizner, "that route is available to him," although the U.S. government could attempt to seize such proceeds.&lt;ref name=WaPoIncome&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Greg |title=U.S. officials scrambled to nab Snowden, hoping he would take a wrong step.

Also in May, the [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal]] unanimously decided to invite Snowden to testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In September, opposition parties in the German parliament filed constitutional complaints to force the government to let Snowden testify in Berlin. Snowden had refused a proposed video conference from Moscow, saying he wants to testify only in Berlin and asking for safe conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014].

On July 13, 2014, ''The Guardian'' published its first story based on an exclusive, seven-hour interview newly conducted with Snowden in a Moscow city centre hotel. Snowden condemned the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK's House of Commons]] on July 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-data-retention-and-investigatory-powers-bill |agency=[[Home Office]] |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; bolstering the state's right to keep personal data held by Internet and phone companies. Snowden said it was very unusual for a public body to pass such emergency legislation except during total war. "I mean we don't have bombs falling. We don't have [[U-boat]]s in the harbor. It defies belief."&lt;ref name=GuardianCondemnation&gt;{{cite news |last=MacAskill |first=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden condemns Britain's emergency surveillance bill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/13/edward-snowden-condemns-britain-emergency-surveillance-bill-nsa |date=July 13, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Snowden had "caused fury" by attacking Britain. "His critics said the new surveillance Bill was being pushed through Parliament today largely because of his treachery in leaking Britain's spy secrets."&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite news |last=Drury |first=Ian |title=Snowden attacks the terror Bill prompted by his treason: Fugitive says plans to monitor communications 'defies belief' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2690901/Snowden-attacks-terror-Bill-prompted-treason-Fugitive-says-plans-monitor-communications-defies-belief.html |date=July 13, 2014 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13 and 17, ''The Guardian'' posted video clips, of about 2 minutes&lt;ref name=GuardianCondemnation /&gt; and 14 minutes&lt;ref name=EndUpInChains&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |last3=Healey |first3=Alex |last4=Sprenger |first4=Richard |last5=Khalili |first5=Mustafa |title=Edward Snowden: 'If I end up in chains in Guantánamo I can live with that' – video interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jul/17/edward-snowden-video-interview |date=July 17, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in length, excerpted from the full interview. On July 18, ''The Guardian'' published a nearly 10,000-word edited transcript of their Snowden interview.&lt;ref name= EditedTranscript&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden interview – the edited transcript |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-interview-transcript |date=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after arriving in Moscow, Snowden said he is still learning Russian. He keeps late and solitary hours, effectively living on U.S. time. He does not drink, cooks for himself but doesn't eat much. "I don't live in absolute secrecy," he says. "I live a pretty open life—but at the same time I don't want to be a celebrity." He does not work for a Russian organization, yet is financially secure thanks to substantial savings from his years as a well-paid contractor and more recently numerous awards and speaking fees from around the world.&lt;ref name=Ispy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=I, spy: Edward Snowden in exile |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-interview-rusbridger-macaskill |date=July 18, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 2014, six days after Snowden's one-year temporary asylum expired, his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, announced that Snowden had received a three-year residency permit. It allowed him to travel freely within Russia and to go abroad for up to three months. Kucherena explained that Snowden had not been granted permanent political asylum, which required a separate process.&lt;ref name=ResidencyNBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nsa-snooping/edward-snowden-can-stay-russia-three-years-lawyer-says-n174776 |title=Edward Snowden Can Stay in Russia for Three Years, Lawyer Says |publisher=NBC News |date=August 7, 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015==
In May 2015, Snowden's lawyer Ben Wizner said that Snowden's main source of income was speaking fees, which sometimes exceeded $10,000 per appearance.&lt;ref name=NYTvictories&gt;{{cite news |last=Shane |first=Scott |date=May 19, 2015 |accessdate=May 20, 2015 |title=Snowden Sees Some Victories, From a Distance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/world/europe/snowden-sees-some-victories-from-a-distance.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Snowden said that he does not intend to play any role in Russian politics and wants to devote his focus to U.S. issues. During a panel event, he said, "people say I live in Russia, but that's actually a little bit of a misunderstanding. I live on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIS8nYqHMro |title=Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security &amp; Free Expression |date=November 10, 2015 |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |website=Secret Sources: Whistleblower, National Security &amp; Free Expression: Edward Snowden |publisher=PEN America |last=Snowden |first=Edward |at=minute 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017==
In the waning days of the Obama administration, former CIA Director [[Michael Morell]] suggested that Russia should extradite Snowden to the United States as a "gift" to Donald Trump. The comment drew harsh criticism by the Russian Foreign Ministry, which noted that Snowden had been granted an extension of his stay until 2020, and said what Morell proposed would be a betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-extends-snowden-asylum-couple-082503508.html |title=Russia Extends Snowden’s Asylum By ‘A Couple More Years’ |date=January 18, 2017 |accessdate=January 18, 2017 |publisher=International Business Times |last=Pascaline |first=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior U.S. official said in February 2017 that Russia was considering extraditing Snowden in order to "curry favor" with [[President Donald Trump]]. Snowden cited the comment as evidence that he was not a Russian spy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 10, 2017 |title=Russia Considers Returning Snowden to U.S. to ‘Curry Favor’ With Trump: Official |author=CYNTHIA MCFADDEN and WILLIAM ARKIN |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921 |accessdate=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives]. Union of International Associations.

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising].

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion].

For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions].

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy].

== Reviews and criticisms ==
There has been several reviews of the ''Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/en/node/146 Selected reviews of the Encyclopedia]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the harshest criticisms came from the American Library Association in 1987: "The board considers the ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' a problematic monument to idiosyncrasy, confusion, and obfuscation that certainly is not worth purchasing at any price."&lt;ref&gt;''Booklist'', v.83, p.698, American Library Association, January 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[The Guardian]]  was extremely critical in a review article published in 1992, to which Anthony Judge recently responded via Transcend Media Service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transcend.org/tms/2013/01/flatulence-is-a-problem-aired/ Flatulence is a Problem Aired], by Anthony Judge, Transcend Media Service, January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on the occasion of the publication  in [[The Wall Street Journal]] of a page-one sympathetic review of the ''Encyclopedia'' initiative, in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323717004578158742420230924 ''Encyclopedia of World Problems Has a Big One of Its Own''], a Wall Street Journal article, by Daniel Michaels, December 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The work itself is keen on presenting, in various places, disclaimers, reservations or warning texts that anticipate criticisms and explain the strengths and weaknesses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/encyclopedia-world-problems-and-human-potential-project-commentaries?kap=20 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Assessment: strengths and weaknesses]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; of its approaches, including the failure to advocate a position, or the sometimes excessive complexity in its methods or language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=21 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Assessment: criticism]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most reviews are laudatory, however. [[Richard Slaughter]] emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.org/reviews/slaught.php A meta-linguistic resource] Richard A. Slaughter, ''Futures'', Oxford, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; As far as practice is concerned, the highest commendation perhaps is to be found in the words of [[Elise Boulding]]: "Any one of us (...) can actively become a part in the world problem solving process by using this encyclopedia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/327819 Encyclopedia review]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Fédération Internationale des Échecs'' ([[FIDE]]) governs international [[chess]] competition. Each month, FIDE publishes the lists "Top 100 Players", "Top 100 Women", "Top 100 Juniors" and "Top 100 Girls", as well as rankings of countries according to the average rating of their top 10 players and top 10 female players. The [[Elo rating system]] is used.

The '''Faith and Globalisation Initiative''' ('''FGI''') is an international group of universities created in 2008 by former [[British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |title=Introduction to Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Yale University=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928130909/http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |archivedate=28 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Faith and Globalisation Initiative is "bringing together some of the world’s leading research Universities to form a global network focusing on the emerging field of faith and globalisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |title=Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation=21 Jan 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151638/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and key objectives==
In 2008 Yale University was the first university the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Foundation]] started working with and in 10 months it expanded the network to include the National University of Singapore, Durham University and McGill University. Two years later the Foundation developed an associate university programme which seeks to foster the study of faith and globalisation in a broad range of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151655/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institutions were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the Initiative, but also to ensure that they have a geographic and cultural spread that lends multiple perspectives to the discipline.

Key objectives of the FGI are the following:
* Develop multi-disciplinary teaching courses on Faith and Globalisation
* Advance knowledge in the field of Faith and Globalisation
* Disseminate university research related to Faith and Globalisation
* Engage policy-makers and the general public on the topic of Faith and Globalisation
* Support the implementation and development of the Foundation's Face to Faith and Faiths Act projects.

'''Feed My Starving Children''' is a Christian [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food to people in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. Founded in 1987, it has reached out to more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmsc.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
Richard Proudfit, a Minneapolis business man and philanthropist, founded the organization after visiting Honduras after a hurricane. Proudfit witnessed dying starving children all around him and was moved to start Feed My Starving Children in 1987. Proudfit risked his life in war zones around the world to feed starving children. Proudfit passed away November 13th, 2018. Together with his second foundation Kids against hunger the two organizations feed over 1 billion children annually. Proudfit received the [[Jefferson Award for Public Service]] in 2012joining the ranks of Bill Gates and Paul Newman.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.startribune.com/feed-my-starving-children-founder-dies-at-88/500424401/&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization recruits volunteers including school children to assist in packing. They also employ paid staff to supervise the operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaststaette Roehrl Eilsbrunn.jpg|thumb|Gaststätte Röhrl in Eilsbrunn (main building)]]
The '''Gaststätte Röhrl''' (Röhrl restaurant) is a [[restaurant]] with [[beer garden]] in Eilsbrunn in the district of [[Regensburg]] ([[Germany]]). Since 1658 it is continuously operated and owned by the Röhrl family.

In November 2010 the [[Guinness Book of Records]] introduced the restaurant as the oldest continuously operated restaurant in the world, conducting business for more than three and half centuries.&lt;ref name="mz1"&gt;[http://www.mittelbayerische.de/index.cfm?pid=10070&amp;pk=607759 "Röhrl" ist das älteste Wirtshaus der Welt (German), accessed on 27 May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and property ==
[[File:Gaststaette Roehrl Eilsbrunn Giebelseite Saaltrakt Westseite.jpg|thumb|upright = 0.6| Festival hall ("Festsaal"), western side]]
The restaurant is located on the western edge of Eilsbrunn, opposite the parish church of St. Wolfgang.

The oldest part of the restaurant, the main building is a two-storey building with garett [[hip roof]] and the taproom behind [[Arch|segmental arch windows]] on the ground floor. This component was built before 1800, maybe early as 1665 as the inscription ''MDCLXV'' suggests. Approximately 50 guests can be accommodated; the decor is simple and largely obtained in the first half of the 20th century according to their time of origin. Above the entrance stands a large [[dormer]] with a [[pulley]] from the roof.

A two-storey [[gabled roof]] construction from 1839 connects to the main building. In the early 20th century another [[saddleback roof]] building for a festival hall with space for 250 guests was erected; the [[Art Nouveau]] door at the entrance to the old building was originally part of this component. The beer garden hosts further 400 guests.

The property is under [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]].

== History ==
The restaurant is operated in the eleventh generation by members of the family Röhrl.

In 1658 the family got the restaurant by marriage of Andreas Röhrl (app. 1636–1706) with Susanna Hofmeister, the innkeeper Georg Hofmeister's daughter. Röhrl was henceforth brewer and landlord of Eilsbrunn. Married twice he left the business to his son Joachim (1676-1737). The year ''MDCLXV'' on the entrance facade suggests that a conversion or new construction of the property was done in 1665. After the death of the fifth Röhrl male in a row, his widow took over the business. In 1839 she reconstructed the building and set up an extension. She later bequeathed the property to her youngest son. A picture in the guest room shows her grandson and successor to her son Johann Nepomuk Röhrl. The opening of the nearby railroad made the area a popular tourist destination for visitors even from other parts of Germany, so that a large festival hall and guest rooms (now discontinued) were erected.

After the death of another Johann Nepomuk Röhrl, taking over the inn after [[World War II]], the daughter Antonie Kolbe took over the Gaststätte Röhrl. In 1971 the brewery was shut down. Since 2006 the inn is directed by her nephew Muk Röhrl, a skilled [[Cook (profession)|cook]] and [[businessman]].

Today the beer sold in the restaurant is mainly produced by the Röhrl brewery in [[Straubing]]. This brewery was founded by Josef Röhrl, the first Johann Nepomuk's brother, in 1881.

[[File:Genoese map Indian Ocean.jpg|thumb|[[Indian ocean]] portion of the Genoese map.]]
The '''Genoese map''' is a 1457 [[world map]].  The map relied extensively on the account of the traveler to Asia [[Niccolo da Conti]], rather than the usual source of [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is not known, but is a more modern development than the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], with fairly good proportions given to each continents.  The map also depicts a three-masted European ship in the [[Indian Ocean]], something which had not occurred yet at the time.&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998" /&gt;

A Genoese flag in the upper northwest corner of the map establishes this map’s origin, along with the coat of arms of the Spinolas, a prominent Genoese mercantile family. Niccolò de'Conti was from a noble mercantile family; at an early age he decided to follow in the family tradition by establishing a lucrative trading operation in the East.[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/niccolo-de-conti]

The Genoese map’s sea monsters reflect the cartographer’s interest in exotic wonders, which is everywhere in evidence on the map, and typical of the scientific outlook of the early modern period, which was driven by curiosity and took a great interest in marvels. The demon-like monster in particular is evidence of the cartographer’s research in recent travel literature to find sea monsters for his map.

This map was done in rich color and was not made particularly used for anything but for display.They say this map was sent to the Portuguese court in 1474 and then to Columbus and this is the map that he used to travel the India sea to the Atlantic but was never proven. The map is now the property of the Italian government and is to be found in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence however the map was not taken care of due to the way it’s been handled throughout the years.

The ships that could carry a thousand men—six hundred seamen and four hundred soldiers. The larger vessels also carried small boats, which were used, as Marco Polo states, “to lay out the anchors, catch fish, bring supplies aboard, and the like. When the ship is under sail, she carries these boats slung to her side.” Many of the vessels had as many as four decks, and even the smaller ones, fifty or sixty cabins. Vegetables, we are told, were sometimes grown on board.

The oval form is not unknown among medieval maps. Hugh of Saint Victor had described the world as being the shape of Noah’s Ark, and Ranulf Higden world maps were oval. A standard way of describing the earth was to compare it to an egg. The main purpose of the analogy seems to have been to describe the various spheres surrounding the earth (egg white, shell), but the idea of an egg shape could have been derived from these works. Another possibility is that the oval form represents the ''mandorla'', or nimbus, which surrounded Christ in many medieval works of art.

'''Glenn Hauser''' (born April 12, 1945 in [[Berkeley, California]]) is an internationally known American [[DXing|DX]]er&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S.|title=Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=October 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettHardy1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Hank|last2=Hardy|first2=David T.|last3=Yoder|first3=Andrew R.|title=The complete shortwave listener's handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_tmz9JIRHsC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=September 1993|publisher=TAB Books|isbn=978-0-8306-4347-9|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radio]] host from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. He produces and presents a weekly 30-minute program, ''World Of Radio'',&lt;ref name="League1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Radio Relay League|title=ARRL Operating Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICivfre46-QC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=August 1997|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-614-6|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard on a number of [[Public broadcasting|non-commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and worldwide on [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].

Hauser began his broadcasting career on [[Radio Canada International]] during the late 1970s, providing DX tips on Sunday nights, and his tips also appeared on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Nederland's]] ''DX Juke Box'' program. He wrote for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Modern Electronics]]'', and published ''Review of International Broadcasting''.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Sheldon, "[http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php Glenn Hauser interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172348/http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php |date=2011-07-06 }}", ''CIDX Special Feature #5'', Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World of Radio''==
''World Of Radio'' debuted in 1980 on [[WUOT]]-FM in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], moving to shortwave two years later. The half-hour program consists of Hauser reading news about radio around the world in a characteristic monotone. Although ''World of Radio'' focuses on shortwave news, it covers all aspects of broadcasting. Most items are contributed by listeners to the program or DX publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofradio.com/dxlatest.txt|title=DX Listening Digest|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mundo Radial''===
Hauser also produced ''Mundo Radial'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] edition of ''World of Radio'', from January 2002 to November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/espanol.html Mundo Radial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Review of International Broadcasting''==
Hauser introduced ''Review of International Broadcasting'' in February 1977.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; The magazine published 154 issues, with columns such as "Listener Insights on Programming," "Radio Equipment Forum," "DX Listening Digest," "The Media Mind" and "Satellite Watch."&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; Contributors included David Newkirk, Loren Cox and Juan Carlos Codina,&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg, Jerome S., "Review of International Broadcasting (1977–1997)", 'Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today'', pg 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; and ''RIB'' also featured columns from the BBC, John Norfolk and Alan Roe.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; It was published monthly during the 1970s and 1980s, later decreasing to quarterly and semiannually before ceasing publication in October 1997.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; ''RIB''{{'}}s successor, ''DX Listening Digest'', went online in 1999.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt;

=={{anchor|Religious views}}Political and religious views==
Hauser is a political [[Liberalism|liberal]] and an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;!-- Think he identifies as atheist. --&gt; which occasionally puts him at odds with the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist-dominated]] [[Shortwave broadcasting in the United States|American shortwave scene]] which carries ''World of Radio''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The connections and pathways of the internet could be seen as the pathways of [[neurons]] and [[synapse]]s in a global brain]]

The '''global brain''' is a neuroscience-inspired and futurological vision of the planetary [[information and communications technology]] [[computer network|network]] that interconnects all humans and their technological artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heylighen|first1=F.|title=What is the global brain?|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIFAQ.html|website=Principa Cybernetica Web|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As this network stores ever more [[information]], takes over ever more functions of coordination and communication from traditional organizations, and becomes increasingly [[intelligent]], it increasingly plays the role of a [[brain]] for the planet [[Earth]].

==Basic ideas==
Proponents of the global brain hypothesis claim that the [[Internet]] increasingly ties its users together into a single information processing system that functions as part of the collective [[nervous system]] of the planet. The intelligence of this network is [[collective intelligence|collective]] or [[distributed cognition|distributed]]: it is not centralized or localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. Therefore, no one can command or control it. Rather, it [[self-organization|self-organizes]] or [[emergence|emerges]] from the [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of [[human–computer interaction|interactions]] between its components. This is a property typical of [[complex adaptive systems]].&lt;ref name=CAS-T-17/&gt;

The [[World-wide web]] in particular resembles the organization of a brain with its webpages (playing a role similar to [[neurons]]) connected by [[hyperlinks]] (playing a role similar to [[synapses]]), together forming an [[Association (psychology)|associative]] network along which information propagates.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"&gt;{{cite conference | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 =  Francis | last2 = Bollen | first2 = J. | date = 1996 | title = The World-Wide Web as a Super-Brain: from metaphor to model | editor-first = R. | editor-last = Trappl  | conference = Cybernetics and Systems' 96 | publisher = Austrian Society For Cybernetics | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/WWW-Super-Brain.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy becomes stronger with the rise of [[social media]], such as [[Facebook]], where links between personal pages represent relationships in a [[social network]] along which information propagates from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinbaum | first = D. | date = 2012 | title = A Framework for Scalable Cognition: Propagation of challenges, towards the implementation of Global Brain models | publisher = GBI working paper 2012-02 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ECCO/ECCO-Papers/Weaver-Attention.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such propagation is similar to the [[spreading activation]] that [[neural networks]] in the brain use to process information in a parallel, distributed manner.

==History==
Although some of the underlying ideas were already expressed by [[Nikola Tesla]] in the late 19th century and were written about by many others before him,  the term “global brain” was coined in 1982 by [[Peter Russell (writer)|Peter Russell]] in his book ''The Global Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Peter Russell (physicist) | last = Russell | first = P. | date = 1983 | title = The Global Brain: speculations on the evolutionary leap to planetary consciousness | location = Los Angeles | publisher = JP Tarcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the Internet might be developed to achieve this was set out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Andrews | first = D. | date =  February 1986 | title = Information routeing groups – Towards the global superbrain: or how to find out what you need to know rather than what you think you need to know | journal = Journal of Information Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–35 | doi=10.1057/jit.1986.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peer-reviewed article on the subject was published by [[Gottfried Mayer-Kress]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer-Kress | first1 = G. | last2 = Barczys | first2 = C. | date = 1995 | title = The global brain as an emergent structure from the Worldwide Computing Network, and its implications for modeling | journal = The information society | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–27 | url = http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | doi = 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960177 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907044231/http://www.ccsr.uiuc.edu/web/Techreports/1990-94/CCSR-94-22.pdf | archivedate = 2012-09-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first [[algorithms]] that could turn the world-wide web into a collectively intelligent network were proposed by [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Johan Bollen]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="pespmc1.vub.ac.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Bollen | first1 = J. | authorlink2 = Francis Heylighen | last2 = Heylighen | first2 = Francis | date = 1996 | title = Algorithms for the self-organization of distributed, multi-user networks.

Reviewing the strands of intellectual history that contributed to the global brain hypothesis, [[Francis Heylighen]] distinguishes four perspectives: ''“organicism”'', ''“encyclopedism”'', ''“emergentism”'' and ''“evolutionary cybernetics”''. He asserts that these developed in relative independence but now are converging in his own scientific re-formulation.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Francis Heylighen | last1 = Heylighen | first1 = Francis | date = 2011 | chapterurl = http://pcp.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf | chapter = Conceptions of a Global Brain: an historical review | title = Evolution: Cosmic, Biological, and Social | editor1-last = Grinin | editor1-first = L.

V. | editor4-last = Spier | editor4-first = F.  | publisher = Uchitel Publishing | pages = 274–289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organicism ===
In the 19th century, the sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] saw society as a [[social organism]] and reflected about its need for a nervous system. Entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler|William Wheeler]] developed the concept of the ant colony as a spatially extended organism, and in the 1930s he coined the term [[superorganism]] to describe such an entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = William Morton Wheeler | last = Wheeler | first = William | date = 1911 | title = The Ant Colony as an Organism | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 22 | pages = 307–325 | doi=10.1002/jmor.1050220206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later adopted by thinkers such as [[Gregory Stock]] in his book [[Metaman]] and [[Joel de Rosnay]] to describe planetary society as a superorganism.

The mental aspects of such an organic system at the planetary level were perhaps first broadly elaborated by palaeontologist and Jesuit priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In 1945, he described a coming “planetisation” of humanity, which he saw as the next phase of accelerating human “socialisation”. Teilhard described both socialization and planetization as irreversible, irresistible processes of ''macrobiological development'' culminating in the emergence of a [[noosphere]], or global mind (see Emergentism below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap VII – The Planetisation of Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent [[living systems theory]] describes both organisms and social systems in terms of the "critical subsystems" ("organs") they need to contain in order to survive, such as an internal transport system, a resource reserve, and a decision-making system. This theory has inspired several thinkers, including Peter Russell and Francis Heylighen to define the global brain as the network of information processing subsystems for the planetary social system.

=== Encyclopedism ===
In the perspective of encyclopedism, the emphasis is on developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. However, by the end of the 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, [[Paul Otlet]] founded the science of documentation, now called [[information science]]. In the 1930s he envisaged a [[World Wide Web]]-like system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. [[H. G. Wells]] proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a [[World Brain]], as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet, although the image of humanity acting informally as a more organic global brain is a recurring motif in other of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=H.G. Wells | title=The New Machiavelli| quote="But the ideas marched on, the ideas marched on, just as though men's brains were no more than stepping-stones, just as though some great brain in which we are all little cells and corpuscles was thinking them! ... And then I came back as if I came back to a refrain; — the ideas go on — as though we are all no more than little cells and corpuscles in some great brain beyond our understanding...."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], too, was inspired by the free-associative possibilities of the brain for his invention. The brain can link different kinds of information without any apparent link otherwise; Berners-Lee thought that computers could become much more powerful if they could imitate this functioning, i.e. make links between any arbitrary piece of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Berners-Lee|1999|pp=4, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful implementation of encyclopedism to date is Wikipedia, which integrates the associative powers of the world-wide-web with the collective intelligence of its millions of contributors, approaching the ideal of a global memory.&lt;ref name="Conceptions of a Global Brain"/&gt; The [[Semantic web]], also first proposed by Berners-Lee, is a system of protocols to make the pieces of knowledge and their links readable by machines, so that they could be used to make automatic [[inference]]s, thus providing this brain-like network with some capacity for autonomous "thinking" or reflection.

=== Emergentism ===
This approach focuses on the emergent aspects of the evolution and development of [[complexity]], including the spiritual, psychological, and moral-ethical aspects of the global brain, and is at present the most speculative approach. The global brain is here seen as a natural and emergent process of planetary evolutionary development. Here again [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] attempted a synthesis of science, social values, and religion in his [[The Phenomenon of Man]], which argues that the ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' (drive, purpose) of universal evolutionary process is the development of greater levels of both complexity and consciousness. Teilhard proposed that if life persists then planetization, as a biological process producing a global brain, would necessarily also produce a global mind, a new level of planetary consciousness and a technologically supported network of thoughts which he called the ''[[noosphere]]''. Teilhard's proposed technological layer for the noosphere can be interpreted as an early anticipation of the Internet and the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Pierre Teilhard de Chardin | last = Teilhard de Chardin | first = Pierre | date = 1964 | title = The Future of Man | chapter = Chap X – The Formation of the Noosphere }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist and philosopher [[Peter Russell (physicist)|Peter Russell]] elaborates a similar view, and stresses the importance of personal spiritual growth, in order to build and to achieve synergy with the spiritual dimension of the emerging superorganism. This approach is most popular in [[New Age]] circles, which emphasize growth in consciousness rather than scientific modelling or the implementation of technological and social systems.

===Evolutionary cybernetics===
[[Systems theory|Systems theorists]] and [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] commonly describe the emergence of a higher order system in evolutionary development as a “[[metasystem transition]]” (a concept introduced by [[Valentin Turchin]]) or a “major evolutionary transition”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The major evolutionary transitions | authorlink1 = Eörs Szathmáry | first1 = Eörs | last1 = Szathmáry | authorlink2 = John Maynard Smith | first2 = John | last2 = Maynard Smith | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 227–232 | date = 16 March 1995 | doi = 10.1038/374227a0 | pmid=7885442| bibcode = 1995Natur.374..227S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a metasystem consists of a group of subsystems that work together in a coordinated, goal-directed manner. It is as such much more powerful and intelligent than its constituent systems. [[Francis Heylighen]] has argued that the global brain is an emerging metasystem with respect to the level of individual human intelligence, and investigated the specific evolutionary mechanisms that promote this transition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2008 | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf | chapter = Accelerating socio-technological evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain | title = Globalization as evolutionary process: modeling global change | publisher = Routledge | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, the Internet fulfils the role of the network of “nerves” that interconnect the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of [[self-organization]] through which such coordination and [[collective intelligence]] emerges.

== Recent developments ==
In 1994 [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], in his popular book ''[[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of Control]]'', posited the emergence of a "[[Collective consciousness|hive mind]]" from a discussion of cybernetics and evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=ooc&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Addison-Wesley| isbn = 0201577933| authorlink = Kevin Kelly (editor) | last = Kelly | first = Kevin| title = [[Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World|Out of control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization]]| location = Reading, Mass| date = 1994| pages = 5–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Francis Heylighen]] and [[Ben Goertzel]] founded the Global Brain group, a discussion forum grouping most of the researchers that had been working on the subject of the global brain to further investigate this phenomenon. The group organized the first international conference on the topic in 2001 at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

After a period of relative neglect, the Global Brain idea has recently seen a resurgence in interest, in part due to talks given on the topic by [[Tim O'Reilly]], the Internet forecaster who popularized the term [[Web 2.0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | authorlink = Tim O'Reilly | first = Tim | last = O'Reilly | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/video/2012/03/22/towards-global-brain?ms=42144 | title = Towards a Global Brain | series = One Great Idea | date = March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yuri Milner]], the social media investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Chrystia | last = Freeland | website = blogs.reuters.com | url = http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ | title = The advent of the global brain }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, the Global Brain Institute (GBI) was founded at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] to develop a mathematical theory of the “brainlike” propagation of information across the Internet. In the same year, [[Thomas W. Malone]] and collaborators from the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]]  have started to explore how the global brain could be “programmed” to work more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Klein | first2 = M. | authorlink3 = Thomas W. Malone | last3 = Malone | first3 = Thomas W. | date = 2012 | title = Programming the Global Brain | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | page = 41 | url = http://cci.mit.edu/publications/CCIwp2011-04.pdf | doi=10.1145/2160718.2160731}}&lt;/ref&gt; using mechanisms of [[collective intelligence]]. The complexity scientist [[Dirk Helbing]] and his NervousNet group have recently started developing a "Planetary Nervous System", which includes a "Global Participatory Platform", as part of the large-scale [[FuturICT]] project, thus preparing some of the groundwork for a Global Brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Dirk Helbing | last1 = Helbing | first1 = Dirk | date = 2015 | chapter = Creating (“Making”) a Planetary Nervous System as Citizen Web | title = Thinking Ahead – Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society | pages = 189–194 | publisher = Springer International Publishing | chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15078-9_13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 [[Elon Musk]] founded the company [[Neuralink]], which aims to create a Neural Lace, which is a concept invented by the novelist [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]] and basically refers to a machine interface woven into the brain, to allow the user to access all available human information. A core driver behind this business idea is Mr Musk’s argument, that human beings soon have to embrace brain implants to stay relevant in a world which, he believes, will soon be dominated by [[artificial intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21719774-do-human-beings-need-embrace-brain-implants-stay-relevant-elon-musk-enters|title=Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm raised $27m from 12 Investors in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-startup-a7916891.html|title=Elon Musk could be about to spend $100m linking human brains to computers|date=2017-08-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
A common criticism of the idea that humanity would become directed by a global brain is that this would reduce individual diversity and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayward | first = W. B. | date = 1999 | title = H. G. Wells' s idea of a World Brain: A critical reassessment | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 50 | issue = 7 | pages = 557–573 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.1010 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:7&lt;557::aid-asi2&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lead to [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brooks | first = M. | date = June 24, 2000 | url = http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0006/msg00182.html | title = Global brain | journal = New Scientist | issue = 2244 | page = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is inspired by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] forms of government, as exemplified by [[George Orwell|George Orwell']]s character of "[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]". It is also inspired by the analogy between collective intelligence or [[swarm intelligence]] and [[insect societies]], such as beehives and ant colonies, in which individuals are essentially interchangeable. In a more extreme view, the global brain has been compared with the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goertzel | first = Ben | date = 2002 | title = Creating Internet Intelligence: Wild computing, distributed digital consciousness, and the emerging global brain | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | url = {{google books|id=Vnzb-xLdvv8C|plainurl=yes}} | isbn = 9780306467356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the race of collectively thinking cyborgs conceived by the [[Star Trek]] science fiction franchise.

Global brain theorists reply that the emergence of distributed intelligence would lead to the exact opposite of this vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2007 | title = The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society | journal = Social Evolution &amp; History | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–119 | url = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/Superorganism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Francis Heylighen | last = Heylighen | first = Francis | date = 2002 | chapter = Das Globale Gehirn als neue Utopia |trans-chapter=The global brain as a new utopia | publisher = Suhrkamp | location = Frankurt | chapterurl = http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/papers/GB-Utopia.pdf | editor1-first = R. | editor1-last = Maresch | editor2-first = F. | editor2-last = Rötzer | title = Renaissance der Utopie }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that effective [[collective intelligence]] requires [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] of opinion, [[decentralization]] and individual independence, as demonstrated by [[James Surowiecki]] in his book [[The Wisdom of Crowds]]. Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.

{{Governance}}
{{basic forms of government}}

'''Global governance''' or '''world governance''' is a movement towards political cooperation among [[transnationality|transnational]] actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global [[governance]]—the [[United Nations]], the [[International Criminal Court]], the [[World Bank]], etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated [[Power in international relations|power]] to enforce compliance.  The modern question of world governance exists in the context of [[globalization]] and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally.  In response to the acceleration of worldwide [[interdependence]], both between human societies and between humankind and the [[biosphere]], the term "global governance" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.

Global governance is not a singular system. There is no "[[world government]]" but the many different regimes of global ''governance'' do have commonalities:
{{quote| While the contemporary system of global political relations is not integrated, the relation between the various regimes of global governance is not insignificant, and the system does have a common dominant organizational form. The dominant mode of organization today is bureaucratic rational—regularized, codified and rational. It is common to all modern regimes of political power and frames the transition from classical sovereignty to what David Held describes as the second regime of sovereignty—liberal international sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= Jmes | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition==

The term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as "collective management of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001610/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique6&amp;lang=en Forum for a New World Governance ; ''Reasons for this Forum for a new World Governance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, ''[[government]]'' has been associated with "governing," or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. ''[[Governance]]'' denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce, by force, their decisions. However, authors like [[James Rosenau]] have also used "governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system.&lt;ref&gt;James Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance," ''in'' Martin Hewson and Timothy J. Sinclair (eds.), ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'' (Albany, NY: [[State University of New York]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some now speak of the development of "global public policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Diane |last=Stone |title=Global Public Policy, Transnational Policy Communities and their Networks |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=19–38 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2007.00251.x |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1800/1/WRAP_Stone_Global_Agora__Transnational_Public_Policy_JPS.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adil Najam]], a scholar on the subject at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]], [[Boston University]] has defined global governance simply as "the management of global processes in the absence of global government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailybruin.com/article/2006/10/a-closer-look-professor-seeks- | title=A Closer Look: Professor Seeks Stronger U.N. | publisher=[[The Daily Bruin]] | date=October 18, 2006 | accessdate=October 17, 2012 | author=Riazati, Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas G. Weiss]], director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center ([[CUNY]]) and editor (2000–05) of the journal ''[[Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations]]'', "'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html The UN and Global Governance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821094009/http://www.unhistory.org/publications/globalgov.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.

The definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes]]. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]), or global (e.g. the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://maihold.org/mediapool/113/1132142/data/Finkelstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These "cooperative problem-solving arrangements" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), [[private sector]] entities, other [[civil society]] actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance, 2nd ed | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | author=Margaret P. Karns and Karen A. Mingst | year=2009 | location=[[Boulder, CO]] | page=633 | isbn=978-1-58826-698-9 | url=https://www.rienner.com/title/International_Organizations_The_Politics_and_Processes_of_Global_Governance_2nd_edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WHO policies on health issues.

In short, global governance may be defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Ramesh Thakur, ''The UN and Global Governance: An Idea and Its Prospects'', [[Indiana University Press]], forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus Alexander, author of ''Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics'', has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of [[global apartheid]], with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Unravelling Global Apartheid: An Overview of World Politics | publisher=Polity Press | author=Alexander, Titus | year= 1996 | pages=320 | url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745613536 | isbn=978-0-7456-1353-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 marked the end of [[Westphalian sovereignty|a long period of international history]] based on a policy of [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]s. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 Blin, Arnaud ; Marin, Gustavo ; "Rethinking Global Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530202243/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article15 |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:

* The growing idea of globalization as a significant theme and the subsequent weakening of nation-states, points to a prospect of transferring to a global level of regulatory instruments. Upon the model that regulation was no longer working effectively at the national or regional levels.
* An intensification of environmental concerns, which received multilateral endorsement at the [[Earth Summit]]. The Summit issues, relating to the climate and [[biodiversity]], symbolized a new approach that was soon to be expressed conceptually by the term [[Global Commons]].
* The emergence of conflicts over standards: trade and the environment, trade and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]], trade and [[public health]]. These conflicts continued the traditional debate over the social effects of macroeconomic stabilization policies, and raised the question of arbitration among equally legitimate objectives in a compartmentalized governance system where the major areas of interdependence are each entrusted to a specialized international institution. Although often limited in scope, these conflicts are nevertheless symbolically powerful, as they raise the question of the principles and institutions of arbitration.
* An increased questioning of international standards and institutions by developing countries, which, having entered the global economy, find it hard to accept that industrialized countries hold onto power and give preference to their own interests. The challenge also comes from civil society, which considers that the international governance system has become the real seat of power and which rejects both its principles and procedures. Although these two lines of criticism often have conflicting beliefs and goals, they have been known to join in order to oppose the dominance of developed countries and major institutions, as demonstrated symbolically by the failure of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;For greater discussion, see: Andreani, Gilles; "Governance global : origines d'une idée"; ''Politique étrangère'', Nº 3, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;549–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

Global governance can be roughly divided into four stages:&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Agenda building|agenda-setting]]; 
# [[policy]]making, 
# [[implementation]] and [[enforcement]], and 
# [[evaluation]], [[wikt:monitoring|monitoring]], and [[adjudication]].

World authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve [[deference]] to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from [[institution]]al status, [[expertise]], [[moral authority]], [[capacity building|capacity]], or perceived competence.&lt;ref&gt;Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell, "Who governs the globe?" in Avant, Finnemore, &amp; Sell (2010), pp. 9–14. "If organizations like the United Nations (UN), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and Exxon are all (potentially) global governors, why are they in charge? Why does anyone pay attention to them? [...] We define authority as the ability to induce deference in others. [...] Deference to authority might take a variety of forms. Authority might cause actors to subordinate their own conscious preferences to the directives of the authority and thus, in Robert Dahl's (1957 and 1968) sense, get one actor to do what she would not otherwise do, but it might also have subtler effects. Authority might create new preferences in actors who were previously indifferent or at odds. It might change preferences in others who become persuaded to share the authority's views based on its moral standing or expertise."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James N. Rosenau]], "Global governance as disaggregated complexity"; in Ba &amp; Hoffmann (2005), pp. 140–41. "In other words, not only has the advent of network forms of organization undermined the authority of states, but in the context of our concern with GG, it has also had even more important consequences. Most notably, networks have contributed to the disaggregation of authority as well as the formation of new collectivities not founded on hierarchical principles. &lt;br&gt; If the notion that new rule systems can be founded on horizontal as well as vertical structures of authority seems awkward, it warrants reiterating that the core of effective authority lies in the compliance of those toward whom it is directed."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
In its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from [[geopolitics]] and the theory of [[international relations]], such as peace, defense, [[geostrategy]], [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations, and [[International trade|trade relations]]. But as [[globalization]] progresses and the number of interdependences increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.

===Environmental governance and managing the planet===
"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the [[effect of human activity on the environment|effect of human activities on nature]] requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and [[social barrier]]s, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. [[Climate change]], [[ocean pollution|ocean]] and [[air pollution]], [[nuclear risk]]s and those related to [[genetic manipulation]], the reduction and [[extinction]] of resources and [[biodiversity]], and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.

This effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, [[environmental management]] is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 Pelayo, G. (ed.) (2008, "Environmental Governance and Managing the Earth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143745/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article380 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel. "Sustainable Development in a Global Context: A Success or a Nuisance?" New Global Studies 9.1 (2015): 27–56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the USA, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B. (2005), "International Environmental Governance: The next steps", in ''Synthèses'' N°02/2005. Iddri, 2005. 4 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a "reform agenda" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global [[environmental governance]]. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Global_Environmental_Governance:_Elements_of_a_Reform_Agenda Najam, A., M. Papa and N. Taiyab (2007), "Global Environmental Governance: Elements of a Reform Agenda"], in Cleveland, C.J. (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Earth'', Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A World Environment Organisation ====

The focus of environmental issues shifted to [[climate change]] from 1992 onwards.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation)&lt;ref&gt;Biermann, F., and Simonis, U.E., 1998. Eine Weltorganisation für Umwelt und Ent-wicklung: Ein Vorschlag [A world organization for environment and development: A proposal]. Universitas. Zeitschrift für interdisziplinäre Wissenschaft 53 (627), pp. 822–31.&lt;/ref&gt; to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J.P., forthcoming 2012. Environmental Governance. Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, S., and Biermann, F., 2005. The debate on a World Environment Organization: An introduction.  A World Environment Organization: Solution or Threat for Effective International Environmental Governance?, Aldershot: Ashgate, 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt; but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega-conferences’&lt;ref&gt;Seyfang, G. and Jordan, A., 2002. “Mega” Environmental Conferences: vehicles for effective, long term environmental planning?, in: S. Stokke, and O. Thommesen, (eds) Yearbook of International Cooperation on Environment and Development, Earthscan: London: 19–26&lt;/ref&gt;(e.g.[[Rio Summit]] and [[Earth Summit 2002]]).

===== Current global environmental governance =====

International environmental organisations do exist. The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN.  UNEP and similar international environmental organisations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticised as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, G., 1992. New Ways To Make International Environmental Law, American Journal of International Law, 86(2), pp. 259–83. and Voynet, D., 2000.

Global Initiative on Sustainable Development. Department of Foreign Affairs (South Africa, 23 June).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that the current decentralised, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"&gt;Lodefalk, M., and Whalley, J., 2002. Reviewing Proposals for a World Environment Organization. The World Economy 25 (5) pp. 601–17.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance;&lt;ref&gt;Najam, A., 2003. The Case against a New International Environmental Organization. Global Governance 9 (3) pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’&lt;ref&gt;Levin, S., 1998. Ecosystems and the biosphere as complex adaptive systems. Ecosystems 1 pp. 431–36&lt;/ref&gt; while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Oberthür, S. and Gehring, T., 2004. Reforming international environmental governance: an institutionalist critique of the proposal for a World Environmental Organisation. Politics, Law and Economics 4 pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====A World Environment Organisation and the World Trade Organisation=====

Many proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate.&lt;ref name="Biermann"&gt;Biermann, F., 2001. The emerging debate on the need for a [[World Environmental Organization]]: a commentary. Global Environmental Politics, 1 pp. 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;von Moltke, K., 2001. The Organization of the Impossible. Global Environmental Politics 1 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO has “had success in integrating [[trade agreement]]s and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”.&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of [[solar energy]] being used to repay some of Greece’s debt after their economy crashed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, H., 2011. Germany may buy Greeks’ sunshine. The Guardian, [online]6 October. Available at &lt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt; [Accessed 2 November 2011],&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.&lt;ref name="LodefalkWhalley"/&gt;

The creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by [[Renato Ruggiero]], the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, [[Supachai Panitchpakdi]].&lt;ref name="Biermann"/&gt; The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

===Governance of the economy and of globalisation===
The [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]] may have undermined faith that [[laissez-faire capitalism]] will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.

Nonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, "refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam."&lt;ref&gt;Tubiana, L. and J.-M. Severino (2002), "Biens publics globaux, gouvernance mondiale et aide publique au développement", ''in'' Jacquet P., J. Pisani Ferry and L. Tubiana, ''Gouvernance mondiale'', La Documentation française, Les Rapports du CAE, N°37, pp. 349–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global [[externality|externalities]] should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?" ''in'' Touffut, J.-Ph. (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Cournot Centre for Economic Studies, Paris, pp. 149/164.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of international trade, Susan George states that ". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 George, S. (2007), "Alternative finances", ''Le Monde Diplomatique'', January.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143817/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article239 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and institutional governance===
Building a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.

Obtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:
* the fuzzy maze of various international organizations, instituted mostly in the wake of World War II; what is needed is a system of international organizations with greater resources and a greater intervention capacity, more transparent, fairer, and more democratic;
* the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]], the very nature of states along with the role they play with regard to the other institutions, and their relations to each other; states will have to share part of their sovereignty with institutions and bodies at other territorial levels, and all with have to begin a major process to deepen democracy and make their organization more responsible;
* the meaning of citizen sovereignty in the different government systems and the role of citizens as political protagonists; there is a need to rethink the meaning of political representation and participation and to sow the seeds of a radical change of consciousness that will make it possible to move in the direction of a situation in which citizens, in practice, will play the leading role at every scale.

The political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section [[Global governance#Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance|Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance]]

===Governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution===
Armed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of [[9/11]], the wars [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Girard|first=Quentin|title=En Europe les actes terroristes islamiques sont rares|journal=Libération|date=July 27, 2011|url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/01012351351-en-europe-les-actes-terroristes-islamistes-sont-rares}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Global War on Terrorism]] arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Anna Cornelia (2010), "Counterterrorism and International Power Relations", IB Tauris, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesawar school attack 2014 is a big challenge to us. Militants from the Pakistani Taliban have attacked an army-run school in Peshawar, killing 141 people, 132 of them children, the military say.

At the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.

The resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.

Andrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the [[Military–industrial complex]] and arms sales. The author also recalls that the "Big Five" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, Andrée (1999), ''Surarmement, pouvoirs, démocratie''; L'Harmattan, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing [[positive peace|prevention of the causes of conflicts]], whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of [[peace]], [[social justice]], and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.

Resources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.

International institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the [[UNIFIL]] was reinforced during the [[2006 Lebanon War]]. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.

Another issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a "principle of humanity." The author defines this principle as follows: "All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 Bachelet, Jean-René; ''Military Ethics for a Better World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143947/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article378 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governance of science, education, information, and communications===
The World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine HACKER, “ Cultiver la créativité, corollaire de la diversité culturelle européenne ”, Revue Géoéconomie : Cinéma: le déclin de l'empire américain?, numéro 58 – été 2011 : http://www.choiseul-editions.com/documents/BC-G58.pdf?PHPSESSID=cab73ffbe617a07900584f09d655e3d0&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has been only partially offset by the [[alter-globalization movement]], starting with [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the events]] that took place at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999|1999 Seattle meeting]], and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the [[Internet]]. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, [[civil society]] has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.

Above all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema&lt;ref&gt;Economic warfare on the silver screen- Interview of Violaine Hacker, {{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |title=Economic warfare on the silver screen |accessdate=2015-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= |date=1970-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as science is concerned, "[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.

Neoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 "Atelier de la Fondation Sciences citoyennes au Forum social mondial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714091819/http://sciencescitoyennes.org/spip.php?article1452 |date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the global level, "[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

On the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: [[conscience clauses]] and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: [[science shop]]s and [[Citizen science|community-based research]]. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uvic.ca/ocbr/assets/pdfs/Global%20Alliance.pdf Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research; ''Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research'']{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that ". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 ''(author's note: the deadline for the [[Millennium Goals]])'', the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfutureonline.org/PolicyAdvocacy/GlblFutr.nsf/issues/92F9DA0279CC03A28825738B0019CDEC?OpenDocument|title=globalfutureonline.org - This website is for sale! - Global Future world vision human development child rights poverty aids peace conflict global Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.globalfutureonline.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must "[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart." The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains "seven principles for education of the future": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 Morin, Edgar; ''Seven Complex Lessons in Education for the Future''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144020/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article223 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. [[Peer-to-peer]] communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as [[Wikipedia]] have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as [[Creative Commons]], cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.

==Regional views==
Regional players, whether regional conglomerates such as [[Mercosur]] and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance.&lt;ref name="ORF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Governance|url=http://www.orfonline.org/programme/global-governance/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann ''et al.'', ''Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/sample-chapters/institutionalizing_Northeast_Asia_web.pdf Timmermann, M. and J.

Interdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like "What can the world bring to my country or region?" into "What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.

===Africa===
Often seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni; ''Giving Africa Voice within Global Governance: Oral History, Human Rights and the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144623/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article198 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

African civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique" for "the construction of a local legitimate governance," state reform "capable of meeting the continent's development challenges," and "effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-gouvernance.net/fiches/bipint/fiche-bipint-63.html Network "Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique"; ''Changeons l’Afrique, 15 propositions pour commencer...'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Foreign-policy proposals announced by President [[Barack Obama]] include restoring the [[Global Poverty Act]], which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/24757.html "Record $49B foreign aid budget clears House" in ''Politico'', July 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 "In Defense of Aid" in ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', July 17, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723092252/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/6274 |date=July 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point/|title="A Turning Point" April 2, 2009|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613174551/https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/04/02/A-Turning-Point|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php "Foreign Policy" in ''Organizing for America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707091922/http://www.barackobama.com/issues/foreign_policy/index_campaign.php |date=2009-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty;
* global de-nuclearization in several stages including stepping up cooperation with Russia to significantly reduce stocks of nuclear arms in both countries;
* revision of the culture of secrecy: institution of a National Declassification Center to make declassification secure but routine, efficient, and cost-effective;
* increase in global funds for AIDS, TB and malaria. Eradication of malaria-related deaths by 2015 by making medicines and mosquito nets far more widely available;
* increase in aid for children and maternal health as well as access to reproductive health-care programs;
* creation of a 2-billion-dollar global fund for education. Increased funds for providing access to drinking water and sanitation;
* other similarly large-scale measures covering agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises and support for a model of international trade that fosters job creation and improves the quality of life in poor countries;
* in terms of energy and global warming, Obama advocates a) an 80% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 b) investing 150 billion dollars in alternative energies over the next 10 years and c) creating a Global Energy Forum capable of initiating a new generation of climate protocols.

===Latin America===
The 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.

In Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml Servicio Informativo "Alai-amlatina"; Asamblea Constituyente (Ecuador)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305040740/http://qollasuyu.indymedia.org/es/2005/10/2700.shtml |date=2010-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan "''que se vayan todos''" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.

In April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the [[new social movements]]. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleaecuador.org Asamblea Constituyente Ecuador 2008; ''Nueva Constitución del Ecuador'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a "constitution of guaranteed well-being" (''Constitución del bienestar garantizado'') inspired by the ancestral community ideology of "good living" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.

In addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.

The new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (''Pacto de Unidad Programático'') established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedib.org/dac ''Hacia una Asamblea Constituyente soberana y participativa''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125005025/http://www.cedib.org/dac/ |date=2005-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The ''latifundio'' system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.
The "unitary plurinational" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, "the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 4. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 222&lt;/ref&gt; This way, "political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . ."&lt;ref&gt;2009 Bolivian Constitution, article 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Latin America: "[[Amazon basin|Amazonia]] . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; ''What Amazonia Does the World Need?'', Rio de Janeiro, 2008, p. 16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. p. 6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly, "[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid. pp. 34–41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: "[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of "people's territory " or even "life territory" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the "responsibility to protect," following up on the "right of humanitarian intervention" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 IBase; FnGM; Ibid.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144106/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article402 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 Expanding and Reinforcing the Objectives of the Kyoto Protocol: Inciting International Stakeholders to Engage in Greenhouse-gas Transparency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article6 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Conference for Climate Change''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810043211/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article24 |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a ''Global Calling-for-Help Center'' or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 Global Calling-for-Help Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144601/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article94 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 World Team E. Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance; ''Greenhouse-gas Emissions and Global Mitigation Efforts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144206/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article26 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See [[Kishore Mahbubani]]).

===Europe===
According to [[Michel Rocard]], Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and "the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel ; ''World Governance. A Personal European View''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocard considers that there are a number of "great questions of the present days" including recognition by all nations of the [[International Criminal Court]], the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines "new problems" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 Rocard, Michel; ''Ibid.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144222/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article109 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ortega, Building the future: the EU's contribution to global governance, ISS, Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[European Strategy and Policy Analysis System]] (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System"&gt;{{cite web|last=ESPAS|title=The European Strategy and Policy Analysis System|url=http://www.espas.europa.eu/home/|publisher=EUISS|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders' views==
It is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.

===Institutional and state stakeholders===

===Members of parliament===
The World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the [[World Social Forum]], drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 World Parliamentary Forum, "Final Declaration of the Sixth World Parliamentary Forum - Caracas 2006"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144303/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article98 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional organizations===
The European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: [[sustainable development]], [[security]], [[peace]] and equity (in the sense of "fairness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225182328/http://ec.europa.eu/governance/governance_global/index_en.htm |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} "Global governance: contribution of the European Union"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-state stakeholders===
The freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.

Pierre Calame believes that "[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance." "Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en Calame, Pierre ; "Non-state Actors and World Governance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144347/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?rubrique37&amp;lang=en |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the '[[Human Potential Movement]]' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'

Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2682&amp;context=facpub Weiss, E.B. 2012. "The Coming Water Crisis: A Common Concern of Humankind"]. Transnational Environmental Law 1(1) 153-168, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of [[regulation]] which includes [[rule-making]] such as laws, and related ideas e.g. [[legal doctrine]] as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass [[cybernetics]] which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the [[regulation of gene expression]] to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] for example.

===World Religious Leaders===
Since 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.full|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Sage Open|volume=3|issue=4|pages=215824401351183|doi=10.1177/2158244013511830|year=2013|last1=Steiner|first1=Sherrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 2015.

==Proposals==
Several stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.

Joseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, J.E. (2004), "The Future of Global Governance", in ''Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD)'', IPD Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article455.html|title=Redefining Global Governance to Meet the Challenges of (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list provides more examples of proposals:
* the security of societies and its correlation with the need for global reforms——a controlled legally-based economy focused on stability, growth, full employment, and North-South convergence;
* equal rights for all, implying the institution of a global redistribution process;
* eradication of poverty in all countries;
* sustainable development on a global scale as an absolute imperative in political action at all levels;
* fight against the roots of terrorism and crime;
* consistent, effective, and fully democratic international institutions;
* Europe sharing its experience in meeting the challenges of globalization and adopting genuine partnership strategies to build a new form of multilateralism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 Groupe de réflexion "Europe-Mondialisation"; ''For Global Reform, a Social Democratic Approach to Globalization''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144357/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article357 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled "Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference." He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: "Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability."
* Democratic policy at the global level requires legitimacy of popular control through representative and direct mechanisms.
* Citizen participation in decision making at global levels requires equality of opportunity to all citizens of the world.
* Multiple spheres of governance, from local to provincial to national to regional and global, should mutually support democratization of decision making at all levels.
* Global democracy must guarantee that global public goods are equitably accessible to all citizens of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 Montréal International Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144412/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article195 |date=2011-10-04 }} ''Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) Conference Report''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Blockchain]] and decentralized platforms can be considered as hyper-political and Global governance tools, capable to manage social interactions on large scale and dismiss traditional central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=083008085091002109121009065100004023014014073092023027101003105086026068106093094125028029021119038017111106028120127023006025122075014092018092000116116089077006022040064023094030088126123026089120094115011009112098106023016006031019067125067008114064&amp;EXT=pdf] ''Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?
 [[SSRN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Vijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance.  They propose a "Two Percent Club" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122466878/abstract|title=Rethinking Fundamental Principles of Global Governance: How to Represent States and Populations in Multilateral Institutions|first1=VIJAYA|last1=RAMACHANDRAN|first2=ENRIQUE J.|last2=RUEDA-SABATER|first3=ROBIN|last3=KRAFT|date=1 July 2009|journal=Governance|volume=22|issue=3|pages=341–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic tool or discipline==
In the light of the unclear meaning of the term "global governance" as a concept in international politics,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2014), "Rethinking Global Governance? Complexity, Authority, Power and Change", International Studies Quarterly, 58: 1, pp. 207-215&lt;/ref&gt; some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional [[international relations]]&lt;ref&gt;K.Dingwerth and P.Pattberg, "Global Governance as a Perspective on World Politics", (2006) Global Governance vol. 12:198.&lt;/ref&gt; theory. [[Thomas G. Weiss]] and [[Rorden Wilkinson]] have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of [[international relations]] as a discipline&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson 920140, "Global Governance to the Rescue: Saving International Relations?", Global Governance, 20: 1, pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson (2019), Rethinking Global Governance, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|9781509527243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities, including those offering courses in [[international relations]], have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.

==Context==
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}
There are those who believe that world architecture depends on establishing a system of world governance. However, the equation is currently becoming far more complicated: Whereas the process used to be about regulating and limiting the individual power of states to avoid disturbing or overturning the status quo, the issue for today's world governance is to have a collective influence on the world's destiny by establishing a system for regulating the many interactions that lie beyond the province of state action. The political homogenization of the planet that has followed the advent of what is known as liberal democracy in its many forms should make it easier to establish a world governance system that goes beyond market laissez-faire and the democratic peace originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], which constitutes a sort of geopolitical laissez-faire.

Another view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. "To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as [[Arnold Toynbee]] has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001055/105586e.pdf UNESCO (1996), ''Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development'', Summary Version, UNESCO, Paris.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need===
Because of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Americans and Europeans provide a good example of this point: on some issues they have differing common grounds in which the division between the public and private spheres still exist. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. Responsibility must play its part with respect to regional and International governments, when balancing the needs of its citizenry.

With the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.

=== Crisis of purpose ===
Pierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and [[Laurence Tubiana]] argue that "[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya"

The authors refer to a "crisis of purpose" and international institutions suffering from "imbalance" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, "a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf Pierre Jacquet; Jean Pisani-Ferry; Laurence Tubiana; ''À la recherche de la gouvernance mondiale''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905000313/http://www.pisani-ferry.net/base/papiers/re-03-REF-gouvernance.pdf |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World government===
Global governance is not [[world government]], and even less [[democratic globalization]]. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance.  Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic [[government]]. This system has been termed [[disaggregated sovereignty]].

===Consensus example===
Improved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the [[UN Global Compact]] brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], especially [[shareholders]], can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-ethic-now.de/gen-eng/0d_weltethos-und-wirtschaft/0d-03-neue-art/0d-03-106-global-com-kritik.php A Global Ethic Now!; ''UN Global Compact Under Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bitcoin]] &amp; Beyond: [[Blockchain]]s, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsillieschool.ca/event/bitcoin-beyond-blockchains-globalization-and-global-governance. Balsillie School&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Expansion of normative mechanisms and globalization of institutions===
One effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: "Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, J.A. (2007), "Civil Society and the Legitimation of Global Governance", CSGR Working Paper No. 223/07&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 Sehm-Patömaki, K. and M. Ulvila (2006), "Dialogues on Party Systems and Global Democratization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143624/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article14 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 Howard, S. (2006), "Organising Globally"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143648/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article236 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; regional authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 Forum de réseaux de régions du monde (2007), "Déclaration des régions sur leur participation à la gouvernance de la mondialisation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004143711/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article231 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and members of parliament in sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lipietz.net/spip.php?article1431|title=A quoi sert le Forum Parlementaire Mondial ?- Alain Lipietz|author=|date=|website=lipietz.net|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation and objectives===
One of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.

This legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, "[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliance21.org/2003/article.php3?id_article=670|title=Main Points for the Discussion with the United Nations (...)|author=|date=|website=www.alliance21.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]], which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.

Furthermore, the Global Constitution "must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Calame proposes the following objectives:
# instituting the conditions for sustainable development
# reducing inequalities
# establishing lasting peace while respecting diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Calame, P. (2003), ''La démocratie en miettes. Pour une révolution de la gouvernance'', Ed. Charles Léopold Mayer, Ed. Descartes et cie. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming international institutions===
Is the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?

Lack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the "[[neoliberal]]" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Rorden (2014), What's Wrong with the WTO and How to Fix it, Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-745-67245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Calame gives an account of this development,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 Calame, Pierre; "Pour une gouvernance mondiale légitime, efficace et démocratique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811144903/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article16 |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2006), "Global public goods and global finance: does global governance ensure that the global public interest is served?", ''in'' Jean-Philippe Touffut, (ed.), ''Advancing Public Goods'', Paris, pp. 149/164&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of "one state, one vote," so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, "the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Gustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/spip.php?article1187|title=La réforme de l'ONU et le mouvement altermondialiste|author=|date=|website=www.cadtm.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The three ‘gaps’ in global governance===
There is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.
Moreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225190757/http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story038/en/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2005|title=WHO - Global Governance|author=|date=25 February 2005|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990).

All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further [[interdependence]] of [[Economy|economic]] and cultural activities around the globe.&lt;ref name="Imagining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1830.xhtml | title=Imagining the Internet | publisher=Elon University School of Communications | work=History of Information Technologies | accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stever_1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stever | first1 = H.

Though many scholars place the [[History of globalization|origins of globalization]] in [[modernity|modern times]], others trace its history long before the [[Europe]]an [[Age of Discovery]] and voyages to the [[New World]], some even to the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GL-H-10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Globalization and Global History |page=127 |url=http://58.192.114.227/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20110522/20110522005012939.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=O'Rourke, Kevin|last2=G.|first2=Williamson, Jeffrey|date=1 April 2002|title=When did globalisation begin?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/6/1/23/540507|journal=European Review of Economic History|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023|issn=1361-4916|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'" [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol7/takis_globalisation.htm ''Democracy &amp; Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', 7:(2) (July 2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

This slowed down from the 1910s onward due to the World Wars and the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Martin|year=2001|title=Will the nation-state survive globalization?|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=80|issue=1|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2001-01-01/will-nation-state-survive-globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; but picked up again in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George (2011).  ''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.  The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War's division of the world- it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market. It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases, the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values, the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN, and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other developments as dramatic were the Internet has become influential in connecting people across the world. {{As of|2012|6}}, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world's human population—have used the services of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |title=The Open Market Internet Index |publisher=Treese.org |date=11 November 1995 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601045949/http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Stats|date=30 June 2012|work=Internet World Stats|publisher=Miniwatts Marketing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of globalization has never been smooth.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]].

[[International standard]]s have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the [[intermodal container]]. [[Containerization]] dramatically reduced transport of its costs, supported the post-war boom in [[international trade]], and was a major element in globalization.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|title=Sample Chapter for Levinson, M.: The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger.|last=Levinson|first=Marc|work=[[The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=17 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122131825/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s9383.html|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Organization for Standardization]] is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national [[standards organizations]].

A [[free-trade area]] is the region encompassing a [[trade bloc]] whose member countries have signed a [[Free trade|free-trade]] agreement (FTA).

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]]. The EU has developed [[European Single Market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant.

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B.

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives."

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

''[[Financial Times]]''. 1 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

(2011). Social movements (Rev. ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following: trade unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land rights and indigenous rights activists, organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development, opponents of privatization, and [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] campaigners.&lt;ref name="stwr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stwr.org/the-un-people-politics/the-anti-globalization-movement-defined.htm|title=The Anti-Globalization Movement Defined Share The World's Resources|last=Engler|first=M.|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=14 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}l&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14785">The '''ITF Rankings''' are the current rankings of national teams by the [[International Tennis Federation]] in both men's and women's [[tennis]]. The ITF produces two sets of rankings—the ITF [[Davis Cup]] Nations Ranking for male national teams, and the ITF [[Fed Cup]] Nations Ranking for female national teams. Both sets of rankings measure the success of all nations participating in both competitions.

The ITF Davis Cup Nations Ranking was launched at the end of 2001 and the ITF Fed Cup Nations Ranking was introduced a year later. Both rankings are updated following every World Group round and are used for [[seed (sports)|seeding]] the highest ranked teams in the draws for each group in the competitions' structures.

==Ranking method==

The ITF [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] rankings are based in a rolling four year cumulative system. However, the points total for each nation is calculated following a weighted sum formula, in which recent results are weighted more heavily.&lt;ref name="ITFDavisCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=daviscup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=Rankings Explained| url = http://www.daviscup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained"&gt;{{cite web|work=fedcup.com|publisher=International Tennis Federation|title=How the Rankings Work| url = http://www.fedcup.com/en/rankings/rankings-explained.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each World Group round, the ranking period adjusts, and points earned in the last year period have a weighting factor of 100% in the points total. At the same time, the weighting factor for the points earned until the same round in the previous three years is reduced to 75% (for points earned one to two years ago), 50% (for points earned two to three years ago) and 25% (for points earned three to four years ago).

Ranking points are awarded only to the winning nation of a competition tie at every round. Victories in World Group rounds are worth more points than those in Zone Groups, and ties at the later rounds of the competition are progressively worth more points. Bonus points are also awarded for a nation that defeats a higher-ranked nation, but only if the latter nation is ranked in the top 64 for the Davis Cup, or in the top 75 for the Fed Cup. Unique to the Davis Cup, there is an additional bonus for a nation that wins a tie in the opponent's home ground: a 25% bonus is added to the total of round points and ranking bonus points (if any). At the Fed Cup only, nations that win by walkover are awarded round points but no bonus points, and no points are awarded for consolation events.

The current ranking points and bonus points distribution tables for the [[Davis Cup]] are shown below:

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In the Groups I, II and III a nation's points are determined by its overall finishing position. Formats vary according to the numbers of nations playing each year so the value of each win alters too. However the maximum points a nation can win at each level remains constant.&lt;ref name="ITFFedCupRankingsExplained" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40567">'''International broadcasting''' is [[broadcasting]] that is deliberately aimed at a foreign, rather than a domestic, audience. It usually is broadcast by means of [[longwave]], [[mediumwave]], or (more usually) [[shortwave]] radio, but in recent years has also used direct [[satellite]] broadcasting and the [[internet]] as means of reaching audiences.

Although radio and television programs do travel outside national borders, in many cases reception by foreigners is accidental. However, for purposes of [[propaganda]], transmitting religious beliefs, keeping in touch with colonies or expatriates, education, improving trade, increasing national prestige, or promoting tourism and goodwill, broadcasting services have operated '''external services''' since the 1920s.

== History ==
International broadcasting, in a limited extent, began during [[World War I]], when German and British stations broadcast press communiqués using [[Morse code]]. With the severing of Germany's undersea cables, the wireless telegraph station in [[Nauen]] was the country's sole means of long-distance communication.

The US Navy Radio Service radio station in New Brunswick, Canada, transmitted the '[[Fourteen Points]]' by wireless to Nauen in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 56&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Nauen station broadcast the news of the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] on November 10, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office. ''International Law Documents: Neutrality, Conduct and Conclusion of Hostilities''. 1919, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
[[File:Guglielmo Marconi 1901 wireless signal.jpg|thumb|[[Guglielmo Marconi]] carried out the first short wave transmissions over a long distance.]]
[[Guglielmo Marconi]] pioneered the use of [[short wave]] radio for long distance transmissions in the early 1920s. Using a system of parabolic reflector antennae, Marconi's assistant, [[Charles Samuel Franklin]], rigged up a large antenna at [[Poldhu|Poldhu Wireless Station]], [[Cornwall]], running on 25&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht ''Elettra'' in the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]].&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h7R36Y0yFUC|title=Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet|author=John Bray|year=2002|publisher=IET|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; High speed shortwave telegraphy circuits were then installed from London to Australia, India, South Africa and Canada as the main element of the [[Imperial Wireless Chain]] from 1926.&lt;ref name="Bray"/&gt;

The Dutch began conducting experiments in the shortwave frequencies in 1925 from [[Eindhoven]]. The radio station [[PCJJ]] began the first international broadcasting on March 11, 1927 with programmes in Dutch for colonies in the [[Dutch West Indies]] and [[Dutch East Indies]] and in German, Spanish and English for the rest of the world. The popular [[Happy Station]] show was inaugurated in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history ''History of Radio Netherlands''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214010/http://www.bureauafrique.nl/autresdepartements/africa/Radionetherlandsturns60/aboutrnw_history |date=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Marconi also turned his attention toward long distance broadcasting on shortwave. His first such broadcasts took place to commemorate [[Armistice Day]] in the same year. He continued running a regular international broadcast that was picked up around the world, with programming from the [[2LO]] station, then run by the [[BBC]]. The success of this operation caught the BBC's attention, and rented out a shortwave transmitting station in [[Chelmsford]], with the callsign G5SW, to Marconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan090920.html|title=Daventry Calling - 2: Station G5SW Chelmsford }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Empire Service]] was finally inaugurated on December 19, 1932, with transmissions aimed towards Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;BBC World Service. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/timeline.shtml ''World Service timeline''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
Other notable early international broadcasters included [[Vatican Radio]] (February 12, 1931), [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]], the official service of the Soviet Union (this has since been renamed the [[Voice of Russia]], following the collapse of the Soviet Union). Clarence W. Jones started transmitting on Christmas Day, 1931 from Christian missionary radio station [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. Broadcasting in South Asia was launched in 1925 in [[Ceylon]] - [[Radio Ceylon]], now the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] is the oldest in the region.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17049, Joseph Goebbels spricht.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Joseph Goebbels]] headed [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]]. International broadcasting was an important element in [[Nazi propaganda]].]]
Shortwave broadcasting from [[Nauen]] in Germany to the USA, Central and South America, and the Far East began in 1926. A second station, [[Zeesen short-wave transmitter (1931)|Zeesen]], was added in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 49&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1932, the German [[Reichspost]] assumed control of the Nauen station and added to its shortwave and longwave capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000:57&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power in 1933, shortwave, under the ''Auslandsrundfunk'' (Foreign Radio Section), was regarded as a vital element of [[Nazi propaganda]].

German shortwave hours were increased from two hours a day to 18 per day, and eventually twelve languages were broadcast on a 24-hour basis, including English. A 100 [[kilowatt]] transmitter and antenna complex was built at [[Zeesen]], near Berlin. Specialty target programming to the United States began in 1933, to South Africa, South America, and East Asia in 1934, and South Asia and Central America in 1938. German propaganda was organized under [[Joseph Goebbels]], and played a key role in the [[German annexation of Austria]] and the [[Munich Crisis]] of 1938.

In 1936, the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Radio Union]] recognized Vatican Radio as a "special case" and authorized its broadcasting without any geographical limits. On December 25, 1937, a Telefunken 25-kW transmitter and two directional antennas were added. Vatican Radio broadcast over 10 frequencies.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"&gt;Levillain 2002: 1600&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalist forces received a powerful [[Telefunken]] transmitter as a gift of Nazi Germany to aid their propaganda efforts, and until 1943 [[Radio Nacional de España]] collaborated with the Axis powers to retransmit in Spanish news from the official radio stations of Germany and Italy.

=== World War II ===
During the [[Second World War]], Russian, German, British, and Italian international broadcasting services expanded. In 1942, the United States initiated its international broadcasting service, the [[Voice of America]]. In the Pacific theater, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] used shortwave radio to keep in touch with the citizens of the Japanese-occupied Philippine Islands.

Several announcers who became well known in their countries included [[British Union of Fascists]] member [[William Joyce]], who was one of the two "[[Lord Haw-Haw]]"s; Frenchmen [[Paul Ferdonnet]] and [[André Olbrecht]], called "the traitors of [Radio] Stuttgart"; and Americans [[Frederick William Kaltenbach]], "Lord Hee-Haw", and [[Mildred Gillars]], one of the two announcers called "[[Axis Sally]]". Listeners to German programs often tuned in for curiosity's sake—at one time, German radio had half a million listeners in the U.S.--but most of them soon lost interest. Japan had "Tokyo Rose", who broadcast Japanese propaganda in English, along with American music to help ensure listeners.

During World War II, Vatican Radio's news broadcasts were banned in Germany. During the war, the radio service operated in four languages.&lt;ref name="Levillain 2002: 1600"/&gt;

The British launched [[Radio SEAC]] from Colombo, [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) during World War II. The station broadcast radio programs to the allied armed forces across the region from their headquarters in Ceylon.

Following the war and German partition, each Germany developed its own international broadcasting station: [[Deutsche Welle]], using studios in [[Cologne]], West Germany, and [[Radio Berlin International]] (RBI) in East Germany. RBI's broadcasts ceased shortly before the reunification of Germany on October 3, 1990, and Deutsche Welle took over its transmitters and frequencies.

=== Cold War Era ===
The Cold War led to increased international broadcasting (and [[radio jamming|jamming]]), as Communist and non-Communist states attempted to influence each other's domestic population. Some of the most prominent Western broadcasters were the [[Voice of America]], the [[BBC World Service]], and the (covertly) CIA-backed [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. The Soviet Union's most prominent service was [[Radio Moscow]] (now the Voice of Russia) and China used [[Radio Peking]] (then [[Radio Beijing]], now [[China Radio International]]). In addition to the U.S.-Soviet cold war, the Chinese-Russian border dispute led to an increase of the numbers of transmitters aimed at the two nations, and the development of new techniques such as playing tapes backwards for reel-to-reel recorders.

West Germany resumed regular shortwave broadcasts using Deutsche Welle on May 3, 1953. Its Julich transmitter site began operation in 1956, with eleven 100-kW Telefunken transmitters. The Wertachtal site was authorized in 1972 and began with four 500-kW transmitters. By 1989, there were 15 transmitters, four of which relayed the Voice of America.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 51&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in East Germany, the Nauen site began transmitting Radio DDR, later Radio Berlin International, on October 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2000: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Antenna system used Radio-Liberty 02.jpg|thumb|400px|Diagrams showing coverage of the [[Radio Liberty]] transmission site at [[Playa de Pals|Playa de Pals, Spain]] {{FFDC|Antenna system used Radio-Liberty 02.jpg|9 May 26|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;
In addition to these states, international broadcast services grew in Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Under the presidency of [[Gamal Nasser]], [[Egypt]]ian transmitters covered the Arab world; Israel's service, [[Kol Yisrael]], served both to present the Israeli point of view to the world and to serve the [[Jewish diaspora]], particularly behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

[[Radio RSA]], as part of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, was established in 1966 to promote the image of South Africa internationally and reduce criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz 2001: 287&lt;/ref&gt; It continued in 1992, when the post-apartheid government renamed it [[Channel Africa]].

Ironically, the isolationist [[Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]], virtually a [[hermit kingdom]], became one of the most prolific international broadcasters during the latter decades of the Cold War, with [[Radio Tirana]] one of the top five broadcasters in terms of hours of programming produced.

=== Today ===
At the end of the [[Cold War]], many international broadcasters cut back on hours and foreign languages broadcast, or reemphasized other language services. For example, in 1984, Radio Canada International broadcast in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech/Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. In 2005, RCI broadcast in English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Spanish. There is a bigger trend towards TV (e.g. BBC World News, NHK World, CCTV-9) and news websites. Some services, such as Swiss Radio International, left shortwave altogether and exist in Internet form. In addition, new standards, such as [[Digital Radio Mondiale]], are being introduced, as well as sending programs over the Web to be played back later, as "[[podcast]]s".

International broadcasting using the traditional audio-only method will not cease any time soon due to its cost efficiencies. However, international broadcasting via television is considered more strategically important at least since the early 2000s.

The [[BBC World Service]] was the first broadcaster to consider setting up a satellite television news and information channel as far back as 1976, but ceded being the first to [[CNN]] (that had primary access to [[Canada]] soon after launch). The defunct BBC World Service [[Antigua]] Relay Station was built in 1976, but its setup costs were not known to have been part of the BBCWS decision processes at the time.

In the early 1990s, many international (as well as domestic) 24-hour news and information channels launched as part of the post-[[Cold War]] prosperity bubble. There was another burst of global news channels launching in the late 2000s as part the developing world trying to catch up with the developed world in this area.

== Reasons for international broadcasting ==
Broadcasters in one country have several reasons to reach out to an audience in other countries. The examples given below are not meant to be exhaustive, but are illustrative.

One clear reason is for ideological, or [[propaganda]] reasons. Many government-owned stations portray their nation in a positive, non-threatening way. This could be to encourage business investment and/or tourism to the nation. Another reason is to combat a negative image produced by other nations or internal dissidents, or insurgents. [[Radio RSA]], the broadcasting arm of the apartheid South African government, is an example of this. A third reason is to promote the ideology of the broadcaster. For example, a program on [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] from the 1960s to the 1980s was ''What is Communism?''

A second reason is to advance a nation's foreign policy interests and agenda by disseminating its views on international affairs or on the events in particular parts of the world. During the [[Cold War]] the American [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] and Indian Radio [[All India Radio|AIR]] were founded to broadcast news from "behind the Iron Curtain" that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally, to disseminate [[disinformation]]. Currently the US operates similar services aimed at [[Cuba]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

The [[BBC World Service]], the [[Voice of America]], [[All India Radio]] and other western broadcasters have emphasized news broadcasts, particularly to countries that are experiencing repression or civil unrest and whose populations are unable to obtain news from non-government sources. In the case of emergencies, a nation may broadcast special programs overseas to inform listeners what is occurring. During Iraqi missile strikes on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, [[Kol Israel]] relayed its domestic service on its shortwave service.

Besides ideological reasons, many stations are run by religious broadcasters and are used to provide religious education, religious music, or worship service programs. For example, [[Vatican Radio]], established in 1931, broadcasts such programs. Another station, such as [[HCJB]] or [[Trans World Radio]] will carry brokered programming from evangelists. In the case of the [[Broadcasting Services of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]], both governmental and religious programming is provided.

Stations also broadcast to international audiences for cultural reasons. Often a station has an official mandate to keep expatriates in touch with the home country. Many broadcasters often relay their national domestic service on shortwave for that reason. Other reasons include teaching a foreign language, such as [[Radio Exterior de España]]'s Spanish class, ''Un idioma sin fronteras'', or the Voice of America's broadcasts in [[Special English]]. In the case of major broadcasters such as the [[BBC World Service]] or [[Radio Australia]], there is also an educational outreach.

An additional reason for international broadcasting is to maintain contact with a country's citizens travelling abroad or expatriates who have emigrated and share news from home as well as cultural programming. This role of external shortwave broadcasting has declined as advances in communications have allowed expatriates to read news from home and listen and watch to domestic broadcasts in their own language via the internet and satellite. A number of international services such as the original [[BBC Empire Service]], [[Radio Netherlands]], France's Poste Colonial (now [[Radio France International]]) and others were founded in part with the goal of helping draw overseas empires closer to the [[mother country]] and provide closer cultural and communication connections between the home country and its colonies, a role that became largely obsolete due to [[decolonization]].

== Means to reach an audience ==
Because of this many broadcasters are discovering they can reach a wider audience through other methods (particularly the internet and satellite television) and are cutting back on (or even entirely dropping) shortwave.

An international broadcaster has several options for reaching a foreign audience:
* If the foreign audience is near the broadcaster, high-power longwave and mediumwave stations can provide reliable coverage.
* If the foreign audience is more than 1,000 kilometers away from the broadcaster, shortwave radio is reliable, but subject to interruption by adverse solar/geomagnetic conditions.
* An international broadcaster may use a local mediumwave or FM radio or television relay station in the target country or countries.
* An international broadcaster may use a local shortwave broadcaster as a relay station.
* Neighboring states, such as [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]], may broadcast television programs to each other's viewing public.

An international broadcaster such as the BBC, Radio France International or Germany's Deutsche Welle, may use all the above methods. Several international broadcasters, such as [[Swiss Radio International]], have abandoned shortwave broadcasting altogether, relying on Internet transmissions only. Others, such as the BBC World Service, have abandoned shortwave transmissions to North America, relying on local relays, the Internet, and satellite transmissions

=== Mediumwave and longwave broadcasts ===
Most radio receivers in the world receive the [[mediumwave]] band (530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1710&amp;nbsp;kHz), which at night is capable of reliable reception from 150 to 2,500&amp;nbsp;km distance from a transmitter. Mediumwave is used heavily all over the world for international broadcasting on a formal and informal basis.

In addition, many receivers used in Europe and Russia can receive the [[longwave]] broadcast band (150 to 280&amp;nbsp;kHz), which provides reliable long-distance communications over continental distances.

=== Shortwave broadcast ===
[[Shortwave receiver]]s are capable of receiving [[shortwave]] transmissions (2,000 to 30,000&amp;nbsp;kHz or 2 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz). Depending on time of day, season of year, solar weather and Earth's geomagnetic field, a signal might reach around the world.

[[Image:RCI-BC-ANZ431-dbu.png|thumb|300px|This sort of map is used by radio engineers to determine the best frequencies to reach international audiences on shortwave bands. In this case, a transmitter is sited in the Southern [[Vancouver Island]], using a frequency of 12095 kHz and transmitting at the 500 kW power level. The picture shows a good signal over the Southern Pacific. The signal fades out as it approaches the [[Eastern states of Australia|East Coast of Australia]].]]

In previous decades shortwave (and sometimes high-powered mediumwave) transmission was regarded as the main (and often the ''only'') way in which broadcasters could reach an international audience. In recent years the proliferation of technologies such as satellite broadcasting, the Internet, and rebroadcasts of programming on AM and FM within target nations has meant that this is no longer necessarily the case.

Transmitter output power has increased since 1920. Higher transmitter powers do guarantee better reception in the target area. Higher transmitter power in most cases counteracts the lesser effects of [[radio jamming|jamming]].
* 1950s : 100&amp;nbsp;kW
* 1960s : 200&amp;nbsp;kW, early 1960s (2 x 100&amp;nbsp;kW 'twinned')
* 1970s : 300&amp;nbsp;kW, but many 250&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters sold
* 1980s : 500&amp;nbsp;kW sometimes transmitters were "doubled up" to produce 1000&amp;nbsp;kW output
* 1980s-present: 600&amp;nbsp;kW single, 1200&amp;nbsp;kW from twinned transmitters.

International stations generally use special [[HRS type antennas|directional antennas]] to aim the signal toward the intended audience and increase the [[Effective radiated power|effective power]] in that direction. Use of such antennas for international broadcasting began in the mid-1930s and became prominent by the 1950s. By using antennas which focus most of their energy in one direction, a modern station may achieve the equivalent, in that direction, of tens of millions of [[watt]]s of radio power.

=== Digital Audio Broadcasting ===
Some international broadcasters have become available via [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) in Europe in the 1990s, and in a similar limited way in the Americas via in-band FM ([[IBOC]]) DAB systems in the US in the 2000s. This is a popular method to reach listeners in cars that would otherwise not be accessible during that part of the day. However, in terms of the global international broadcasting audience the DAB listener base is very small—one can assume that it is less than 2% of the listener base globally.

=== Television ===
International broadcasting via 24 hour TV news channels has its origins in North America in the early 1980s. CNN technically was the first 24-hour international news channel as it was made available in Canada soon after launch. The BBC World Service considered setting up a global TV news channel as far back as 1975, but abandoned the idea for internal reasons.

Notwithstanding a large number of international 24-hour television news and information broadcasters, the television percentage of viewers is still fairly small when compared to global radio listener numbers.

The rural populations of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (as well as East Asia) have radio listener bases that are far larger than the largest international TV broadcaster could hope for, yet they could be considered underserved since the end of the Cold War (when these regions had more radio broadcasts targeted at them).

==== Streaming video sites ====
Many international television broadcasters (as well as domestic television broadcasters) have set up accounts on streaming video sites like [[YouTube]] to allow their news and information broadcasts to be globally distributed. The viewer numbers for these sites may seem huge. Cable, TVRO and terrestrial television broadcasters probably have 100 to 1,000 times larger audiences for their international broadcasting content.

International broadcasters known to maintain their own streaming video sites (not authoritative):

* [[Al Jazeera English]]
* [[BBC World News]]
* [[CNN International]]
* [[DD News]]
* [[Deutsche Welle|DW]]
* [[France 24]]
* [[i24NEWS]]
* [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly known as “Russia Today”)
* [[Sky News]]
* [[WION (TV channel)|WION]] (World is One News)

=== RSS feeds and email ===
Many international broadcasters (television or radio) can reach "unreachable" audiences via email and RSS feeds. This is not at all unusual, as the first commonly agreed international broadcast was a Morse Code telegram transmitted from US President Wilson to the German Kaiser (mid-1918) via a high powered longwave transmitter on the US East Coast (this important event in international broadcasting history was described in depth in the IEEE "The History of International Broadcasting" first volume). As Morse Code is considered to be a data format, with email and RSS merely being refinements of the technology it can be said that international broadcasting has a deep relationship with modern-day datacasting.

The reach of RSS and email for international broadcasters is not really known that well, especially considering that emails get forwarded. The numbers for active RSS and email audiences are probably 5 to 20 times larger than for streaming video. It may take into the 2010s to get meaningful numbers with respect to the size of these audiences for assorted technical reasons related to the RSS and email technologies.

Email and RSS feeds can traverse telecommunications barriers that streaming video cannot, thus the larger expected audience numbers. The global economic downturn of 2008-2009 will probably increase the email and RSS audience sizes as fewer people will be able to afford high speed internet connections in North America, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.

== Listeners ==
An international broadcaster may have the technical means of reaching a foreign audience, but unless the foreign audience has a reason to listen, the effectiveness of the broadcaster is in question.

One of the most common foreign audiences consists of expatriates, who cannot listen to radio or watch television programs from home. Another common audience is [[Shortwave listening|radio hobbyists]], who attempt to listen to as many countries as possible and obtain verification cards or letters (''QSLs''). These audiences send letters and in response few radio stations write them back. These kind of Listeners often take part in weekly and monthly quizzes and contests started by many radio stations. A third audience consists of journalists, government officials, and key businesspersons, who exert a disproportionate influence on a state's foreign or economic policy.

A fourth, but less publicized audience, consists of intelligence officers and agents who monitor broadcasts for both [[open-source intelligence]] clues to the broadcasting state's policies and for hidden messages to foreign agents operating in the receiving country. The BBC started its monitoring service in Caversham, Reading in 1936 (now [[BBC Monitoring]]). In the United States, the [[United States Director of National Intelligence|DNI]] [[Open Source Center]] (formerly the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]]) provides the same service. Copies of OSC/FBIS reports can be found in many U.S. libraries that serve as government depositories. In addition, a number of hobbyists listen and report "spook" transmissions.

Without these four audiences, international broadcasters face difficulty in getting funding. In 2001, for example, the BBC World Service stopped transmitting shortwave broadcasts to North America, and other international broadcasters, such as YLE Radio Finland, stopped certain foreign-language programs.

However, international broadcasting has been successful when a country does not provide programming wanted by a wide segment of the population. In the 1960s, when there was no BBC service playing rock and roll, Radio Television Luxembourg ([[RTL Group|RTL]]) broadcast rock and roll, including bands such as [[the Beatles]], into the United Kingdom. Similar programming came from an unlicensed, or "pirate" station, [[Radio Caroline]], which broadcast from a ship in the international waters of the North Sea.

== Restricting reception ==
In many cases, governments do not want their citizens listening to international broadcasters. In Nazi Germany, a major propaganda campaign, backed by law and prison sentences, attempted to discourage Germans from listening to such stations. The practice was made illegal in 1939.&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"&gt;Hughes and Mann 2002: 93&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the German government sold a cheap, 76-[[Reichsmark]] [[Volksempfänger|"People's Receiver"]], as well as an even cheaper 35-Reichsmark receiver,&lt;ref name="Hughes and Mann 2002: 93"/&gt; that could not pick up distant signals well.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"&gt;Graef 2005: 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was copied by Stalin's Soviet Union, which had a nearly identical copy manufactured in the Tesla factory in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="Graef 2005: 36"/&gt;
In North Korea, all receivers are sold with fixed frequencies, tuned to local stations.

The most common method of preventing reception is [[radio jamming|jamming]], or broadcasting a signal on the same frequencies as the international broadcaster. Germany jammed the BBC European service during the Second World War. Russian and Eastern European jammers were aimed against [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]], other Western broadcasters, and against Chinese broadcasters during the nadir of Sino-Soviet relations. In 2002, the Cuban government jammed the [[Voice of America]]'s [[Radio y Televisión Martí|Radio Martí]] program and the Chinese government jammed [[Radio Free Asia]], [[Voice of America]], [[Radio Taiwan International]] as well broadcasts made by adherents of [[Falun Gong]].

North Korea restricts most people to a single fixed frequency mediumwave receiver; those who met political requirements and whose work absolutely required familiarity with events abroad were allowed shortwave receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin 2006: 495&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of reaching people with government radio programming, but not foreign programming, is the use of radio broadcasting by direct broadcasting to loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Philip W. ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1991 edition, {{ISBN|0-85229-400-X}}, p 315&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jackson, director of the Voice of America, noted "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They're very resourceful."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David. "The Future of Radio II". ''World Radio TV Handbook'', 2007 edition. 2007, Billboard Books. {{ISBN|0-8230-5997-9}}. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another method of preventing reception involves moving a domestic station to the frequency used by the international broadcaster. During the Batista government of Cuba, and during the Castro years, Cuban medium-wave stations broadcast on the frequencies of popular South Florida stations. In October 2002, Iraq changed frequencies of two stations to block the Voice of America's [[Radio Sawa]] program.

Jamming can be defeated by using very efficient transmitting antennas, carefully choosing the transmitted frequency, changing transmitted frequency often, using [[Single-sideband modulation|single sideband]], and properly aiming the receiving antenna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27681">This '''list of largest universities by enrollment''' in the world includes total active enrollment across all campuses, as well as off-campus study. The enrollment numbers listed are the sum of [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] students in active enrollment. The universities included below confer degrees of bachelor-level or higher, and either share a central board of governance and a single chancellor or president, or confer degrees with the same institution name.

Many of these universities, particularly those in the United States, are actually systems of separate university campuses, and may not accurately represent a comparable student body. For example, the enrollment listed for the University of California is the population of the entire student body in the University of California system, which is composed of several individual campuses statewide. All University of California campuses are entitled "University of California" and then denoted further by the campus location, such as "University of California, Irvine". Other states organize their public universities differently in ways that further complicate any direct comparisons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">A '''mutual recognition agreement''' ('''MRA''') is an international agreement by which two or more countries agree to recognize one another's [[conformity assessment]]s.
A '''mutual recognition arrangement''' is an international arrangement based on such an agreement.

MRAs have become increasingly common since the formation of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1995.  They have been forged within and among various [[trade bloc]]s, including [[APEC]] and the [[European Union]].

MRAs are most commonly applied to goods, such as various [[quality control]] MRAs.  However, the term is sometimes applied to agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications as well.

Accreditation Bodies, under the [[International Accreditation Forum]] use the term ''Multilateral Recognition Agreements'' in a similar sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MLA Purpose |url=https://www.iaf.nu/articles/Purpose/15 |website=IAF |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38147">The '''Official Women's Squash World Ranking''' is the official world ranking for women's [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The ranking is to rate the performance level of female professional squash player. It is also a merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in women's squash tournaments. The rankings are produced monthly.&lt;ref name="rank&amp;divisor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://psaworldtour.com/squash/guides/20161005113420_PSATourRuleBook20162017.pdf |title=PSA Tour Rule Book |publisher=PSA |page=41 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world number one is [[Nour El Sherbini]] of Egypt, who replaced [[Laura Massaro]] in May 2016.

==PSA Ranking Policy==
Players competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.

The total number of points a player earns in a year (52 weeks) is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum of eight are required) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 8 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e., the lowest are not included).

For example, a player who has competed in 13 events will have selected her best 10 scores, which will be accumulated and divided by 10.

Players competing in [[Professional Squash Association|PSA World Tour]] Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.

==Overview==
The goal of the Pacific Health Summit is to connect science, industry, and policy for a healthier world. Traditionally, the main work of the Summit has been an annual meeting, where top decision makers convene to discuss how to realize the dream of a healthier future through the effective utilization of scientific advances, combined with industrial innovation and appropriate policies. In autumn of 2012 on the heels of its eight major conference, the Summit shifted its focus from an annual meeting to more targeted work that builds on the past themes and concrete outcomes. As it has since 2005, the Summit will continue to provide a year-round forum for world leaders to grapple with problems and solutions, share best practices, and forge effective collaborations.

==History==
The first Pacific Health Summit was held in Seattle, Washington in 2005 with foundational support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the [http://www.trff.org/ Russell Family Foundation].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Summit-hopes-to-spark-talks-on-Earth-s-health-1162197.php "Summit hopes to spark talks on Earth’s health", The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 12/19/2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the co-creation of 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine winner [[Leland H. Hartwell]], businessman and philanthropist George F. Russell Jr., Co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation [[William H. Gates Sr.]], and Founding Director of the National Bureau of Asian Research’s Center for Health and Aging Michael Birt.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf About the Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302222048/http://www.pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf |date=2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBR has been the Secretariat of the Summit since the inaugural 2005 conference. 

Birt, founding Executive Director of the Summit, stepped down from his role as NBR’s Center for Health and Aging Director in 2009, and from his role as Executive Director in 2012, handing the mantle to Claire Topal, the Summit's Managing Director, who ran the Summit and managed the team from 2009-2012. She now serves as Senior Advisor for International Health to NBR. Nualchan Sakchalathorn, the Summit’s Project Director, served on the Summit team from 2007-2012.

Building on Bill Gates Sr.'s strong personal support, in 2007 [[Tachi Yamada]], then President of Global Health at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, took on a decisive leadership role and formally established the Foundation as the Summit's third co-presenting organization. 

In 2008, the Wellcome Trust joined the Summit as the fourth official co-presenting organization, and Trust Director, [[Sir Mark Walport]], joined our Executive Committee. Both [[Sir William Castell]], Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, who has participated in the Summit since its first year, and Sir Mark provided crucial leadership as the Summit began its rotation in London for the annual meeting.

Peter Neupert, then Corporate Vice President for Health Solutions Strategy for Microsoft, and [[Craig Mundie]], Chief Research and Strategy Officer of Microsoft, consistently provided a private sector perspective to the Summit's strategic discussions. Additionally, GE Healthcare, through Bill Castell in 2005, has always provided critical advice and perspective, as well as the critical founding sponsorship for the annual meeting. 

Out of this initial foundation of leadership, the Summit grew into one of the world's premier global health gatherings every year. In 2012, eight years after the inaugural meeting, which was never designed to take place in perpetuity, global health is in an exciting new place. The Summit’s interactive format has proliferated, and decision-makers across all sectors and geographies are collaborating on all the critical global health issues the Summit sought to address: health technology, pandemic flu, MDR-TB, vaccines, malnutrition, maternal and newborn health, and many more. While the Summit is proud of eight years of transformational conversations, countless new friendships, and exciting partnerships, there is still much work to do – and so much momentum on which to build. NBR is looking forward and excited to build on the Summit’s legacy in the years to come.

Additionally, the denial of a US visa for 2009 Summit participant Paul Thorn of the Tuberculosis Survival Project, due to his HIV positive status, became the impetus behind the repeal of a US travel restriction law on individuals carrying the HIV/AIDs virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8136456.stm "Activist helps US HIV law change", BBC News, 7/06/2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and [[global citizenship]] among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Human '''prehistory''' is the period between the use of the first [[stone tools]] {{circa}} 3.3 million years ago by [[hominin]]s and the invention of [[Writing system|writing systems]]. The earliest writing systems appeared {{circa}} 5,300 years ago, but it took thousands of years for writing to be widely adopted and it was not used in some human cultures until the 19th century or even until present. The end of prehistory therefore came at very different dates in different places, and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently.

[[Sumer]] in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus valley civilization]] and [[ancient Egypt]] were the first civilizations to develop their own scripts, and to keep historical records; this took place already during the early [[Bronze Age]]. Neighboring civilizations were the first to follow. Most other civilizations reached the end of prehistory during the [[Iron Age]].  The [[three-age system]] of division of prehistory into the [[Stone Age]], followed by the Bronze Age and Iron Age, remains in use for much of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]], but is not generally used in those parts of the world where [[metalworking|the working of hard metals]] arrived abruptly with contact with [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian cultures]], such as [[the Americas]], [[Oceania]], [[Australasia]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].  These areas also, with some exceptions in [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian civilizations]] in the Americas, did not develop complex writing systems before the arrival of Eurasians, and their prehistory reaches into relatively recent periods; for example 1788 is usually taken as the end of the [[prehistory of Australia]].     

The period when a culture is written about by others, but has not developed its own writing is often known as the [[protohistory]] of the culture.  By definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary Entry|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prehistory|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no written records from human prehistory, so dating of prehistoric materials is crucial. Clear techniques for dating were not well-developed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graslund, Bo. 1987. ''The birth of prehistoric chronology.'' Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is concerned with human prehistory, the time since behaviorally and anatomically modern humans first appeared until the beginning of recorded history. Earlier periods are also called "prehistoric"; there are separate articles for the overall [[history of the Earth]] and the [[history of life]] before humans.

;Beginning: The term "prehistory" can refer to the vast span of time since the [[big bang|beginning]] of the [[Universe]] or the Earth, but more often it refers to the period since [[life]] appeared on Earth, or even more specifically to the time since human-like beings appeared.&lt;ref name="fagan07"&gt;Fagan, Brian. 2007. ''World Prehistory: A brief introduction'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Seventh Edition, Chapter One&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renfrew"&gt;Renfrew, Colin. 2008. ''Prehistory: The Making of the Human Mind.'' New York: Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;
;End:The date marking the end of prehistory in a particular culture or region, that is, the date when relevant [[List of languages by first written accounts|written historical]] records become a useful academic resource, varies enormously from region to region. For example, in [[Egypt]] it is generally accepted that prehistory ended around 3200 BCE, whereas in [[New Guinea]] the end of the prehistoric era is set much more recently, at around 1900 [[Common Era|common era]]. In Europe the relatively well-documented classical cultures of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] had neighbouring cultures, including the [[Celts]] and to a lesser extent the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], with little or no writing, and historians must decide how much weight to give to the often highly prejudiced accounts of these "prehistoric" cultures in Greek and Roman literature.
;Time periods: In dividing up human prehistory in Eurasia, historians typically use the [[three-age system]], whereas scholars of pre-human time periods typically use the [[chronostratigraphy|well-defined]] [[geologic record]] and its internationally defined [[stratum]] base within the [[era (geology)|geologic time scale]]. The three-age system is the [[periodization]] of human prehistory into three consecutive [[time period]]s, named for their respective predominant tool-making technologies:
:*[[Stone Age]]
:*[[Bronze Age]]
:*[[Iron Age]]&lt;ref name="Minds"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy (Ed.) |title=Prehistoric Minds: Human Origins as a Cultural Artefact |date=2011 |publisher=Royal Society of London |url=https://www.academia.edu/3088568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the term===
The notion of "prehistory" began to surface during the Enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word 'primitive' to describe societies that existed before written records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Matthew Daniel |title=The Line of Reason: Hugh Blair, Spatiality and the Progressive Structure of Language |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |year=2011 |volume=65 |pages=9–24 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112084 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word prehistory in English, however, occurred in the ''Foreign [[Quarterly Review]]'' in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Prehistoric Mind as a Historical Artefact|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|year=2011|volume=65|pages=1–8|url=https://www.academia.edu/1130650|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the geologic time scale for pre-human time periods, and of the three-age system for human prehistory, is a system that emerged during the late nineteenth century in the work of British, German and Scandinavian [[Archaeology|archeologists]], [[Antiquarian|antiquarians]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name="Minds"/&gt;

==Means of research==
The main source for prehistory is [[archaeology]], but some scholars are beginning to make more use of evidence from the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name="Iberia"&gt;The Prehistory of Iberia: Debating Early Social Stratification and the State edited by María Cruz Berrocal, Leonardo García Sanjuán, Antonio Gilman. Pg 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;Historical Archaeology: Back from the Edge. Edited by Pedro Paulo A. Funari, Martin Hall, Sian Jones. Pg 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal"&gt;Through the Ages in Palestinian Archaeology: An Introductory Handbook. By Walter E. Ras. Pg 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been articulated by advocates of [[deep history]].

The primary researchers into human prehistory are archaeologists and physical [[anthropologists]] who use excavation, geologic and geographic surveys, and other scientific analysis to reveal and interpret the nature and behavior of pre-literate and non-literate peoples.&lt;ref name="fagan07"/&gt; Human population [[geneticists]] and [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] are also providing valuable insight for these questions.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Cultural anthropologists help provide context for societal interactions, by which objects of human origin pass among people, allowing an analysis of any article that arises in a human prehistoric context.&lt;ref name="renfrew"/&gt; Therefore, data about prehistory is provided by a wide variety of natural and social sciences, such as [[paleontology]], [[biology]], [[archaeology]], [[palynology]], [[geology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], [[comparative linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[molecular genetics]] and many others.

Human prehistory differs from history not only in terms of its [[chronology]] but in the way it deals with the activities of [[archaeological culture]]s rather than named [[nation]]s or [[individual]]s. Restricted to material processes, remains and artifacts rather than written records, prehistory is anonymous. Because of this, reference terms that prehistorians use, such as [[Neanderthal]] or [[Iron Age]] are modern labels with definitions sometimes subject to debate.

== Stone Age ==
The concept of a "Stone Age" is found useful in the archaeology of most of the world, though in the [[archaeology of the Americas]] it is called by different names and begins with a [[Lithic stage]], or sometimes [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]].  The sub-divisions described below are used for Eurasia, and not consistently across the whole area. 

=== Palaeolithic ===
{{main|Paleolithic}}
[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Map of early human &lt;!--don't link to hum. mig. article, only covers modern--&gt;migrations, according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]]. Numbers are [[millennia]] before the present (accuracy disputed).]]

"Palaeolithic" means "Old Stone Age", and begins with the first use of [[stone tool]]s. The Paleolithic is the earliest period of the [[Stone Age]].

The early part of the Palaeolithic is called the [[Lower Palaeolithic]], which predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', beginning with ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (and related species) and with the earliest stone tools, dated to around 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;The Essence of Anthropology 3rd ed. By William A. Haviland, Harald E. L. Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBrid. Pg 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[control of fire]] by early humans during the Lower Palaeolithic Era is uncertain and has at best limited scholarly support. The most widely accepted claim is that ''H. erectus'' or ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]'' made fires between 790,000 and 690,000&amp;nbsp;BP (before the present period) in a site at [[Bnot Ya'akov Bridge]], [[Israel]]. The use of fire enabled early humans to cook food, provide warmth, and have a light source at night.

[[Early Homo sapiens|Early ''Homo sapiens'']] originated some 200,000 years ago, ushering in the [[Middle Palaeolithic]]. Anatomic changes indicating modern language capacity also arise during the Middle Palaeolithic.&lt;ref&gt;Race and Human Evolution. By Milford H. Wolpoff. Pg 348.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Middle Palaeolithic Era, there is the first definitive evidence of human use of fire. Sites in Zambia have charred bone and wood that have been dated to 61,000 B.P. The systematic [[Paleolithic religion|burial of the dead]], [[origin of music|music]], [[prehistoric art|early art]], and the use of increasingly sophisticated multi-part tools are highlights of the Middle Paleolithic.

Throughout the Palaeolithic, humans generally lived as [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s. [[Hunter-gatherer#Social structure|Hunter-gatherer societies]] tended to be very small and egalitarian,&lt;ref&gt;Vanishing Voices : The Extinction of the World's Languages. By Daniel Nettle, Suzanne Romaine Merton Professor of English Language University of Oxford. pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; though hunter-gatherer societies with abundant resources or advanced food-storage techniques sometimes developed sedentary lifestyles with complex social structures such as chiefdoms{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, and [[social stratification]]. Long-distance contacts may have been established, as in the case of [[Indigenous Australian]] "highways" known as [[songlines]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Mesolithic ===
{{Main|Mesolithic}}
[[File:Dugout boats Kierikki Centre Oulu 20130526.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Dugout canoe]]]]
The "Mesolithic", or "Middle Stone Age" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "''mesos''", "middle", and "''lithos''", "stone") was a period in the development of human [[technology]] between the Palaeolithic and [[Neolithic]] periods of the Stone Age.

The Mesolithic period began at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, some 10,000 BP, and ended with [[Agriculture#History|the introduction of agriculture]], the date of which varied by geographic region. In some areas, such as the [[Near East]], agriculture was already underway by the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and there the Mesolithic is short and poorly defined. In areas with limited [[glacial]] impact, the term "[[Epipalaeolithic]]" is sometimes preferred.

Regions that experienced greater environmental effects as the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era, lasting millennia. In [[Northern Europe]], societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the [[marsh]]lands fostered by the warmer climate. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours that are preserved in the material record, such as the [[Maglemosian]] and [[Azilian]] cultures. These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BCE (6,000 [[Before Present|BP]]) in northern Europe.

Remains from this period are few and far between, often limited to [[midden]]s. In forested areas, the first signs of [[deforestation]] have been found, although this would only begin in earnest during the Neolithic, when more space was needed for [[agriculture]].

The Mesolithic is characterized in most areas by small composite [[flint]] tools — [[microlith]]s and [[microburin]]s. [[Fishing tackle]], stone [[adze]]s and wooden objects, e.g. [[canoe]]s and [[bow (weapon)|bows]], have been found at some sites. These technologies first occur in Africa, associated with the Azilian cultures, before spreading to Europe through the [[Ibero-Maurusian]] culture of Northern Africa and the [[Kebaran]] culture of the [[Levant]]. Independent discovery is not always ruled out.

The Neolithic is a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic crops and of [[domestication|domesticated animals]].

Early Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants, both wild and domesticated, which included [[einkorn wheat]], [[millet]] and [[spelt]], and the keeping of [[origin of the domestic dog|dogs]], [[sheep]] and [[goat#History|goats]]. By about 6,900–6,400 BCE, it included domesticated [[cattle]] and [[domesticated pig|pigs]], the establishment of permanently or seasonally inhabited settlements, and the use of [[pottery]]. The Neolithic period saw the development of early [[village]]s, [[agriculture]], animal [[domestication]], [[tool]]s and the onset of the earliest recorded incidents of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perfectirishgifts.com/blog/2008/06/prehistoric_massacres_the_twin.html The Perfect Gift: Prehistoric Massacres.

It ended when metal tools became widespread (in the [[chalcolithic|Copper Age]] or [[Bronze Age]]; or, in some geographical regions, in the [[Iron Age]]).The term ''Neolithic'' is commonly used in the [[Old World]], as its application to cultures in the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] that did not fully develop metal-working technology raises problems.

Settlements became more permanent with some having circular houses with single rooms made of [[mudbrick]]. Settlements might have a surrounding stone wall to keep domesticated animals in and protect the inhabitants from other tribes. Later settlements have rectangular mud-brick houses where the family lived together in single or multiple rooms. Burial findings suggest an [[ancestor cult]] where people [[Plastered human skulls|preserved skulls]] of the dead. The [[Vinča culture]] may have created the earliest system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Pre-writing in Southeastern Europe: The Sign System of the Vinča Culture ca. 4000 BC|last = Winn|first = Shan|publisher = Western Publishers|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Calgary|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[megalith]]ic temple complexes of [[Ġgantija]] are notable for their gigantic structures.

===Chalcolithic===
{{Main|Chalcolithic}}
[[File:Los Millares recreacion cuadro.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Copper Age walled city, [[Los Millares]], [[Iberia]]]]
In Old World archaeology, the "Chalcolithic", "Eneolithic" or "Copper Age" refers to a transitional period where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the widespread use of stone tools. During this period, some weapons and tools were made of copper. This period was still largely Neolithic in character. It is a phase of the [[Bronze Age]] before it was discovered that adding [[tin]] to [[copper]] formed the harder [[bronze]]. The Copper Age was originally defined as a transition between the [[Neolithic]] and the Bronze Age. However, because it is characterized by the use of metals, the Copper Age is considered a part of the Bronze Age rather than the Stone Age.
[[File:TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Chalcolithic copper mine in [[Timna Valley]], [[Negev Desert]], [[Israel]]]]
An archaeological site in [[Serbia]] contains the oldest securely dated evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 7,500 years ago. The find in June 2010 extends the known record of copper smelting by about 800 years, and suggests that copper smelting may have been invented in separate parts of Asia and Europe at that time rather than spreading from a single source.&lt;ref name="archaeology.ws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian site may have hosted first copper makers|author=|date=July 17, 2010|work=ScienceNews|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60563/description/Serbian_site_may_have_hosted_first_copper_makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[metallurgy]] may have occurred first in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where it gave rise to the Bronze Age in the [[4th millennium BCE]] (the traditional view), though finds from the [[Vinča culture]] in Europe have now been securely dated to slightly earlier than those of the Fertile Crescent. [[Timna Valley]] contains evidence of copper mining 9,000 to 7,000 years ago. The process of transition from [[Neolithic]] to Chalcolithic in the Middle East is characterized in archaeological stone tool assemblages by a decline in high quality raw material procurement and use. North Africa and the Nile Valley imported its iron technology from the [[Near East]] and followed the Near Eastern course of Bronze Age and [[Iron Age]] development. However the [[Iron Age]] and Bronze Age occurred simultaneously in much of Africa.

== Bronze Age ==
{{Main|Bronze Age}}
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ox]]-drawn [[plow]], [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], c. 1200 BCE.]]

The Bronze Age is the earliest period in which some civilizations have reached the end of prehistory, by introducing written records. The Bronze Age or parts thereof are thus considered to be part of prehistory only for the regions and civilizations who adopted or developed a system of keeping written records during later periods.  The [[History of writing|invention of writing]] coincides in some areas with the early beginnings of the Bronze Age. Soon after the appearance of writing, people started creating texts including written accounts of events and records of administrative matters.

The term Bronze Age refers to a period in human cultural development when the most advanced [[metalworking]] (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally occurring outcroppings of ores, and then combining them to cast [[bronze]]. These naturally occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in Western Asia before 3000 BCE. The Bronze Age forms part of the [[three-age system]] for prehistoric societies. In this system, it follows the [[Neolithic]] in some areas of the world.

While copper is a common ore, deposits of tin are rare in the [[Old World]], and often had to be traded or carried considerable distances from the few mines, stimulating the creation of extensive trading routes.  In many areas as far apart as China and England, the valuable new material was used for weapons but for a long time apparently not available for agricultural tools.  Much of it seems to have been hoarded by social elites, and sometimes deposited in extravagant quantities, from [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s and [[Copper Hoard Culture|Indian copper hoards]] to European [[hoard]]s of unused axe-heads.

By the end of the Bronze Age large states, which are often called empires, had arisen in Egypt, China, [[Anatolia]] (the [[Hittites]]) and [[History of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], all of them literate.

== Iron Age ==
{{Main|Iron Age|Classical antiquity}}

The Iron Age is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. Most remaining civilizations did so during the Iron Age, often through conquest by the empires, which continued to expand during this period.  For example, in most of Europe conquest by the [[Roman Empire]] means that the term Iron Age is replaced by "Roman", "[[Gallo-Roman]]" and similar terms after the conquest.

In archaeology, the Iron Age refers to the advent of [[ferrous metallurgy]]. The adoption of [[iron]] coincided with other changes in some past cultures, often including more sophisticated agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, which makes the archaeological Iron Age coincide with the "[[Axial Age]]" in the history of philosophy.  Although iron ore is common, the metalworking techniques necessary to use iron are very different from those needed for the metal used earlier, and iron was slow-spreading and for long mainly used for weapons, while bronze remained typical for tools, as well as art.

The '''Revolutions of 1989''' formed part of a [[revolutionary wave]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s that resulted in the end of communist rule in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and beyond.

On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[Polish legislative election, 1989|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful fall of Communism in that country in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]], leading to an exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilised East Germany. This led to mass demonstrations in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence in September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, became the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had split into five successor states, namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and eventually split in 2006 into two states, namely [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognised]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008. [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved three years after the end of Communist rule, splitting peacefully into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/Constitutions/Yugoslavia.html | publisher = CECL |date=1992-04-27 | accessdate = 2013-08-12 | place = [[Greece|GR]] | title = Constitution | contribution = Yugoslavia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of these events made itself felt in several [[Socialist countries]]. Communism was abandoned in countries such as [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition and State of Cambodia (1989–1992)|Cambodia]] (1991), [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (1990), [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (which in 1990 [[Mongolian legislative election, 1990|democratically re-elected]] a Communist government that ran the country until [[Mongolian legislative election, 1996|1996]]) and [[South Yemen]] (1990).

During the adoption of varying forms of [[market economy]], there was a [[1990s#Economics|general decline in living standards]] for many former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Living standards CR"&gt;{{cite book|title= Vývoj vybraných ukazatelů životní úrovně v České republice v letech 1993&amp;nbsp;– 2008| year = 2009 | publisher= Odbor analýz a statistiky.

Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s. In [[South America]], the [[Pink tide]] had instead begun, starting with [[Venezuela]] in 1999 and sweeping through the early 2000s. The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].

== Background ==
=== Development of the Eastern Bloc ===
{{further|Eastern Bloc|List of socialist states}}
[[File:Fourthcongressofthepuwp.JPG|thumb|The fourth congress of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], held in 1963]]
[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|Queue waiting to enter a store, a typical view in [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Poland in the 1980s]]]]
[[Socialism]] had been gaining momentum among working class citizens of the world since the 19th century. These culminated in the early 20th century when several [[State (polity)|states]] and [[colonies]] formed their own [[communist parties]]. Many of the countries involved had [[hierarchical structure]]s with [[monarchic]] governments and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social structures with an established [[nobility]]. Socialism was undesirable within the circles of the [[ruling class]]es (which had begun to include industrial business leaders) in the late 19th/early 20th century states; as such, [[communism]] was repressed. Its champions suffered persecution while people were discouraged from adopting it. This had been the practice even in states which identified as exercising a multi-party system.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].

During the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.

In the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the "Soviet sphere of political influence.". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.

After World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
Labour turmoil in Poland during 1980 had led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]], [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wałęsa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.

=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===
{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratisation in the Soviet Union}}
Although several Eastern bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], subsidies to foreign client states etc., further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].

The first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the [[Eastern bloc]] was still subject to [[secret police]] and political repression.

Gorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other [[Eastern bloc]] countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], Bulgaria's [[Todor Zhivkov]], Czechoslovakia's [[Gustáv Husák]] and Romania's [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania – Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too," declared one East German politburo member.&lt;ref name = "Steele" /&gt;

== Leadup to revolution ==
By the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].&lt;ref name="ShlyGlasnost"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetrynaSarc"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$18 billion at that time) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself.&lt;ref name="GorbachevBoC"&gt;Gorbachev, Mikhail (1996), interview in Johnson, Thomas, ''{{YouTube|dd-QBnAd5qY|The Battle of Chernobyl}}'', [film], Discovery Channel, retrieved 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regime changes outside of Eastern Europe ==
{{see also|Third Wave Democracy}}
In February 1986, in one of the first peaceful, mass-movement revolutions against a dictatorship, the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] peacefully overthrew dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and inaugurated [[Cory Aquino]] as president.

The [[domino effect]] of the revolutions of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime and [[Pinochet]]'s [[military dictatorship]] in Chile were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. [[Argentina]], [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[South Korea]], [[Suriname]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], among many others, elected democratic governments.

Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures by the late 1990s there were well over 100 democracies in the world, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Solidarity's impact grows ==
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|20–21 March 1981, issue of ''Wieczór Wrocławia'' (''This Evening in [[Wrocław]]'') shows blank spaces remaining after the government censor pulled articles from page 1 (right, "What happened at [[Bydgoszcz]]?") and from the last page (left, "Country-wide strike alert"), leaving only their titles as the printers—[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity-trade-union]] members—decided to run the newspaper with blank spaces intact and the bottom of page 1 of this master copy bears the hand-written Solidarity confirmation of that decision]]

Throughout the mid-1980s, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] persisted solely as an underground organization, supported by the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).

By 1989, the Soviet Union had repealed the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]] in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to break free of Soviet domination.

== National political movements ==
=== China ===
{{main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}
New Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1982–1987) developed the concept of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and local [[Socialist market economy|market economy]] around 1984, but the policy stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 3 February 2012 | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7719657.html | title = 'Market fundamentalism' is unpractical | newspaper = People's Daily | publisher = Central Committee of the Communist Party | place = [[China|CN]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chinese student demonstrations, which directly preceded the Beijing protests of 1989, took place in December 1986 in [[Hefei]]. The students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad and greater availability of Western pop culture. Their protests took advantage of the loosening political atmosphere and included rallies against the slow pace of reform. [[Hu Yaobang]], a protégé of Deng Xiaoping and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP general secretary in January 1987. In the "Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign", Hu would be further denounced.

The Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 students had gathered at [[Tiananmen Square]] to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]]. The movement lasted for seven weeks.&lt;ref name= "Zhao153"&gt;{{Citation | first = Dingxin | last = Zhao | title = The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement | place = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 0-226-98260-2 | page = 153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev's visit to China on 15 May during the protests brought many foreign news agencies to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals of the protesters helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who were watching. The Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], having begun earlier than the Soviets to radically reform the economy, was open to political reform, but not at the cost of a potential return to the disorder of the [[Cultural Revolution]].

The movement lasted from Hu's death on 15 April until tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist.

On 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow has asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold, but stated 'Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states—friends, allies or any others—are inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lech Walesa George H Bush.PNG|thumb|Solidarity Chairman [[Lech Wałęsa]] (center) with President [[George H. W. Bush]] (right) and Barbara Bush (left) in Warsaw, July 1989]]
A [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] hit Poland in April and May 1988, and a second wave began on 15 August that year when a strike broke out at the [[July Manifesto]] coal mine in [[Jastrzębie-Zdrój]], the workers demanding the re-legalisation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed by a number of shipyards, including on 22 August, the [[Gdansk Shipyard]], famous as the epicentre of the [[History of Solidarity|1980 industrial unrest]] that spawned Solidarity.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 151}} On 31 August 1988 [[Lech Wałęsa]], the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 157}} On 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation, although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 174}} On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free [[Polish legislative election, 1989|parliamentary elections]] to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the [[Sejm]], while in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one remaining seat taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.

On 15 August 1989, the Communists' two longtime coalition partners, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), broke their alliance with the PZPR and announced their support for Solidarity. The last Communist Prime Minister of Poland, General [[Czesław Kiszczak]], said he would resign to allow a non-Communist to form an administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/world/poland-s-premier-offering-to-yield-to-non-communist.html?scp=187&amp;sq=Poland&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=1619ADC23679717BAA7BEEB89D42F7C7 | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Tagliabue | title=Poland's premier offering to yield to non-Communist | date=15 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Solidarity was the only other political grouping that could possibly form a government, it was virtually assured that a Solidarity member would become prime minister. On 19 August 1989, in a stunning watershed moment, [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], an anti-Communist editor, Solidarity supporter, and devout Catholic, was nominated as Prime Minister of Poland and the Soviet Union voiced no protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/weekinreview/a-new-orbit-poland-s-break-leads-europe-and-communism-to-a-threshold.html?scp=825&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=6C7A9946FB31BA34FCA893628C2ECB2B | work= The New York Times | first=R.

The [[Warsaw Pact]] was dissolved on 1 July 1991. On 27 October 1991 the [[Polish parliamentary election, 1991|first entirely free Polish parliamentary elections]] since 1945 took place.

{{main|End of Communism in Hungary (1989)}}
{{see also|Removal of Hungary's border fence|Pan-European Picnic}}
Following Poland's lead, Hungary was next to switch to a non-Communist government. Although Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[János Kádár]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party on 23 May 1988 with [[Károly Grósz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/world/hungarian-party-replaces-kadar-with-his-premier.html?scp=135&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=E283E53C9144CEB5DC839A7740A35E80 | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Party replace Kadar with his premier | date= 23 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1988 [[Miklós Németh]] was appointed Prime Minister.

[[File:Nemzeti Ünnep - Szabadság tér 1989.03.15 (4).jpg|thumb|Demonstration at the State TV headquarters, 15 March 1989]]
Mass demonstrations on 15 March, the National Day, persuaded the regime to begin negotiations with the emergent non-Communist political forces. [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table talks]] began on 22 April and continued until the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September. The talks involved the Communists (MSzMP) and the newly emerging independent political forces [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]], the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SzDSz), the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF), the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]], the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|Hungarian People's Party]], the Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Society, and the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific Workers. At a later stage the [[Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] and the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) were invited.{{Sfn | Falk | 2003 | p = 147}} It was at the talks that a number of Hungary's future political leaders emerged, including [[László Sólyom]], [[József Antall]], [[György Szabad]], [[Péter Tölgyessy]] and [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = József | last = Bayer | contribution-url =  http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/bayer22.pdf | contribution = The Process of Political System Change in Hungary | title = Schriftenreihe | publisher = Europa Institutes | place = Budapest, [[Hungary|HU]] | year = 2003 | page = 180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1989, the first visible cracks in the [[Iron Curtain]] appeared when [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] began [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|dismantling its {{convert |240|km| adj =on}} long border fence with Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stokes | first = G | title = The Walls Came Tumbling Down | page = 131 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This increasingly destabilized the [[East Germany|GDR]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] over the summer and autumn as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border. On 1 June 1989 the Communist Party admitted that former Prime Minister [[Imre Nagy]], hanged for treason for his role in the 1956 Hungarian uprising, was executed illegally after a show trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/01/world/hungarian-party-assails-nagy-s-execution.html?scp=654&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=AB4FDDAFE5F0111C9B81EEA7B377A93F | work=The New York Times | title = Hungarian Party Assails Nagy's Execution | date=1 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 June 1989 Nagy was given a solemn funeral on Budapest's largest square in front of crowds of at least 100,000, followed by a hero's burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/17/world/hungarian-who-led-56-revolt-is-buried-as-a-hero.html?scp=678&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=1CA5680B13F144C9AD6C2CA30484B16C | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Who Led '56 Revolt Is Buried as a Hero | date=17 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Table agreement of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered an overhaul of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], establishment of a [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]], the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus).{{Sfn | Heenan | Lamontagne | 1999 | p = 13}}{{Sfn | De Nevers | 2003 | p = 130}} The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system.{{Sfn | Elster | Offe | Preuss | 1998 | p = 66}} A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). On 7 October 1989, the Communist Party at its last congress re-established itself as the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/world/communist-party-in-hungary-votes-for-radical-shift.html?scp=28&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8A34A86DC90090167E32320BB95CB02F | work = The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Communist party in Hungary votes for radical shift | date=8 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election, which took place on [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|March 24, 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/19/world/hungary-purges-stalinism-from-its-constitution.html?scp=61&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=142906DE0FC1FFA303D77A84282021BB | work = The New York Times | title = Hungary Purges Stalinism From Its Constitution | date= 19 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/20/world/hungary-legalizes-opposition-groups.html?scp=68&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=57F88FEB3671803C0BA623ABE2583F4C | work=The New York Times | title=Hungary legalizes opposition groups | date= 20 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 1989, on the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 Revolution, the Communist regime in Hungary was formally abolished.  The [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Soviet military occupation of Hungary]], which had persisted since World War II, ended on 19 June 1991.

=== East Germany ===
{{main|Die Wende|German reunification|Peaceful Revolution}}
[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], 10 November 1989]]
On 2 May 1989, Hungary started dismantling its barbed-wire border with [[Austria]], opening a large hole through the Iron Curtain to the West that was used by a growing number of East Germans. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR ([[Czechoslovakia]]) as the only neighboring state where East Germans could escape to. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.

After the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence and there were rumors a Tiananmen Square-style massacre was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918–2000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as "Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben" ("He who is too late is punished by life"). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.

In spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. This victory of the people facing down the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens to take to the streets. The following Monday, 16 October, 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.

[[Erich Honecker]] had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the [[East Germany|GDR]], as by the [[Warsaw Pact]], would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the [[Eastern Bloc]], and so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and had to remain in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing and on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week. The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, but the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[Günter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect "immediately, without delay," hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and opened the gates to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.

On 13 November, GDR Prime Minister [[Willi Stoph]] and his entire cabinet resigned. A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]]. On 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the constitution of the GDR. On 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later. On 7 December Round Table talks opened between the SED and other political parties. On 16 December 1989, the SED was dissolved and refounded as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|SED-PDS]], abandoning Marxism-Leninism and becoming a mainstream democratic socialist party.

On 15 January 1990, the Stasi's headquarters was stormed by protesters. Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany until free elections were held on 18 March 1990—the first held in that part of Germany since 1933. The SED, renamed the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was heavily defeated. [[Lothar de Maizière]] of the East German Christian Democratic Union became Prime Minister on 4 April 1990 on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the West. The two Germanies were reunified on 3 October 1990.

The Kremlin's willingness to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a dramatic shift by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental paradigm change in international relations, which until 1989 had been dominated by the East-West divide running through Berlin itself. The last Russian troops left the territory of the former GDR, now part of a reunited [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], on 1 September 1994.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{main|Velvet Revolution}}

[[File:Bratislava Slovakia 213.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|Memorial of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Bratislava]] ([[SNP Square (Bratislava)|Námestie SNP]]), [[Slovakia]]]]
The "Velvet Revolution" was a non-violent revolution in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government. On 17 November 1989 (Friday), riot police suppressed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague, although controversy continues over whether anyone died that night. That event sparked a series of popular demonstrations from 19 November to late December. By 20 November the number of peaceful protesters assembled in Prague had swelled from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated half-million. Five days later, the Letná Square protest held 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/demonstrace-na-letne-pred-25-lety-urychlily-kapitulaci-komunistu-20141123.html | title = Demonstrace na letne pred 25 lety urychlily kapitulaci komunistu | language = cs| place = [[Czhec|CZ]] | newspaper = Denik}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, the entire Communist Party leadership, including general secretary [[Miloš Jakeš]], resigned. A two-hour general strike, involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was successfully held on 27 November.

With the collapse of other Communist governments, and increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November 1989 that it would relinquish power and dismantle the single-party state. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President [[Gustáv Husák]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and [[Václav Havel]] the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 27 June 1991 the last Soviet troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=20 Years After Soviet Soldiers Left the Czech Republic, Russians Move In|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/28/soviet-soldiers-left-czechoslovakia-20-years-ago-ordinary-well-off-russians-to-move-in/ | newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
In October and November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].

Mladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the "leading role" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism–Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

=== Romania ===
{{main|Romanian Revolution}}
After having suppressed the [[Braşov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[László Tőkés]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. Tőkés was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timişoara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.

Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceauşescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.

At first the security forces obeyed Ceauşescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu’s Romania|date=November 2012|publisher=East European Politics &amp; Societies|page=34|url=http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518013101/http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|dead-url=yes|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceauşescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building. The revolution resulted in 1,104 deaths. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system.

Although elation followed the flight of the Ceauşescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceauşescus facing a hasty trial, and then undergoing [[summary execution]]. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. However, they were postponed until 20 May 1990. Over 1,000 people died during the Romanian Revolution, out of which 100 where children and the youngest was only one month. The Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and his wife, Elena Ceauşescu, were executed by firing squad after a very brief trial. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989.

=== Mongolia ===
{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}
Mongolia declared independence in 1911 after the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Mongolian People's Party]] [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|took power]] in 1921 and the party renamed itself the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitutions of the Communist World|editor-first=William B.|editor-last=Simons|publisher=BRILL|year=1980|ISBN=9028600701|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. After [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] left in 1984, the new leadership under [[Jambyn Batmönkh]] implemented economic reforms, but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes,&lt;ref name="Kaplonski" /&gt; which led to the "Mongolian Revolution", a democratic [[Nonviolent revolution|peaceful]] revolution that started with demonstrations and [[hunger strike]]s that ended 70-years of [[socialism]] and eventually moved towards democracy. It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. It ended with the [[authoritarian]] government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], [[Erdeniin Bat-Üül]], and [[Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar]].

During the period of the morning of 10 December 1989, the first public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in the capital of Ulaanbaatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.|first=Dari|title=

The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform, but within the context of a "human democratic socialism".&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt; The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional [[Mongolian script]]&amp;mdash;which most Mongolians could not read&amp;mdash;as a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In late December 1989, demonstrations increased when news came of [[Garry Kasparov]]'s interview to ''[[Playboy]]'', suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, History, and Politics in Mongolia: The Memory of Heroes|first=Christopher|last=Kaplonski|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=51, 56, 60, 64–65, 67, 80–82|ISBN=1134396732}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to some 1,000, met on square in front of Lenin Museum which was named as Freedom Square since then in [[Ulaanbaatar]]. A demonstration on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] on 21 January (in weather of -30&amp;nbsp;C) followed. Protesters carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan (also referred to [[Genghis Khan]]), rehabilitating a figure which Soviet schooling neglected to praise.&lt;ref name="Fineman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-24/news/mn-609_1_rock-music/2|title=Mongolia Reform Group Marches to Rock Anthem|first=Mark|last=Fineman|date=1990-01-24|accessdate=2012-12-26|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Mongolia-watchers in Beijing said that... the democracy movement is rooted more in nationalism than in dissent....

Mongolia's first free, multi-party elections for a bicameral parliament took place on 29 July 1990.&lt;ref name="Amarsanaa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-24/news/wr-748_1_mongolian-democratic-party|title=Briefing Paper : For the First Time, Mongolians Have Political Choices|last=Holley|first=David|date=24 July 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|place=Los Angeles, CA|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties ran for 430 seats in the Great Hural. Opposition parties were not able to nominate enough candidates. The opposition nominated 346 candidates for the 430 seats in the Great Hural (upper house). The [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] MPRP won 357 seats in the Great Hural and 31 out of 53 seats in the Small Hural (which was later abolished) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Staisch, Werner M. Prohl, ''Dschingis Khan lächelt'', Bonn 1998, p.38ff&lt;/ref&gt; The MPRP enjoyed a strong position in the countryside. The [[State Great Khural]] first met on 3 September 1990 and elected a president (MPRP), vice president ([[Mongolian Social Democratic Party|Social Democrat]]) who was also a chairman of the Baga Hural, prime minister (MPRP), and 50 members to the Baga Hural (lower house). In November 1991, the People's Great Hural began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH). The MPRP retained its majority, but lost the 1996 elections. The final Russian troops, which had stationed in Mongolia in 1966, fully withdrew in December 1992.

=== Yugoslavia ===
{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version of "Communism"]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a doctrine of "[[Brotherhood and unity]]", but tensions between ethnicities began to escalate with the so-called [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. In 1974 there followed constitutional changes, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some of the federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]]. In the late 1980s [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]n leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] used the Kosovo crisis to stoke up Serb nationalism and attempt to consolidate and dominate the country, which alienated the other ethnic groups.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Parallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] witnessed a policy of gradual liberalization since 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] on one side, and the central Yugoslav Party and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]] on the other side. By the late 1980s, many civil society groups were pushing towards democratization, while widening the space for cultural plurality. In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the Serbian Communist leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

In January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and Croatian Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end the Yugoslav Communist Party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.

On 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1990|elections in Slovenia]], while on 24 April 1990 the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|Croatian elections]] witnessed the landslide victory of the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tuđman]]. The results were much more balanced in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election, 1990|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 1990|Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1990|parliamentary]] and [[Serbian presidential election, 1990|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 1990|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milošević and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.

The Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while the [[Serbs of Croatia]] organized the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[Slovenian independence referendum, 1990|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |format=PDF |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatian independence referendum]] on 2 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.

The escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:
* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)
* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995)
* [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995)
* [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

In addition, the [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]] (1999–2001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91–92}}

=== Albania ===
{{main|Fall of Communism in Albania}} &lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Fall of Communism in Albania.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of Enver Hoxha's Statue in central Tirana on 11 December 1990]] --&gt;
In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], began to gradually open up the regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]] and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest.

== Malta Summit ==
[[File:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[George H. W. Bush]] on board the Soviet cruise ship ''Maxim Gorky'', [[Marsaxlokk Harbour]]]]
The [[Malta Summit]] consisted of a meeting between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and U.S.S.R. leader Mikhail Gorbachev, taking place between 2–3 December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a meeting which contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]]{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} partially as a result of the broader pro-democracy movement. It was their second meeting following a meeting that included then President Ronald Reagan, in New York in December 1988. News reports of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=1989: Malta Summit Ends Cold War|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm|accessdate=23 February 2015| publisher =BBC | work = News|date=3 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the Malta Summit as the most important since 1945, when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt agreed on a post-war plan for Europe at the [[Yalta Conference]].

== Election chronology in Central/Eastern Europe and Central Asia ==
Between June 1989 and April 1991, every Communist or former Communist Central and Eastern European or Asian country—and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia every constituent republic—held competitive parliamentary elections for the first time in many decades.

== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|Tanks in Moscow's [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup attempt]]]]
On 1 July 1991, the Warsaw Pact was officially dissolved at a meeting in Prague. At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US–Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US–Soviet cooperation during the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.

As the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Red Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.

Disaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.

''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.

After a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.

Over the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.

Two weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.

=== Baltic states ===
{{main|Singing Revolution}}
[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union.

The Singing Revolution is a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Thomson | first=Clare | title=The Singing Revolution: A Political Journey through the Baltic States | location= London  | publisher= Joseph | year= 1992 | isbn= 0-7181-3459-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Ginkel | first=John |date=September 2002 | title=Identity Construction in Latvia's "Singing Revolution": Why inter-ethnic conflict failed to occur | journal=Nationalities Papers | volume=30| issue=3| pages=403–33 | doi = 10.1080/0090599022000011697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, [[Heinz Valk]], in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass night-singing demonstrations at the [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nI73PdnqQlcC&amp;pg | title = Between Utopia and Disillusionment | first = Henri | last = Vogt | p = 26 | ISBN = 1-57181-895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declared its sovereignty]] from the Soviet Union on 16 November 1988. Lithuania followed on 18 May 1989 and Latvia on 28 July 1989. [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania declared full independence]] on 11 March 1990 and on 30 March, Estonia announced the start of a transitional period to independence, [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|followed by Latvia]] on 4 May. These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|"January Events" in Lithuania]] and "[[The Barricades]]" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.

Soon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.

=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===
* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on August 25, 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new postcommunist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko]], has obtained power. After a short period he increased his power as a result of two controversial referenda (1995–96) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.
* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces. Communists came back to power in a 2001 election under [[Vladimir Voronin]], but faced [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]] in 2009 over accusations of rigged elections.
* {{flag|Ukraine}} [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared its independence]] in August 1991. Presidencies of former Communists [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]] were followed by the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, in which Ukrainians elected [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (also former member of [[CPSU]]).

=== Transcaucasia ===
[[File:April9victims.jpg|thumb|Photos of 9 April 1989 victims of the [[Tbilisi massacre]] on a billboard in [[Tbilisi]]]]
* {{flag|Georgia|1990}} and the [[North Caucasus]] have been marred by ethnic and sectarian violence since the collapse of the USSR. In April 1989 the [[Soviet Army]] [[April 9 tragedy|massacred]] demonstrators in [[Tbilisi]]. By November 1989, the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] officially condemned the Russian invasion in 1921. Democracy activist [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] served as president from 1991 to 1992. Russia aided break-away republics in wars in [[1991-1992 South Ossetia War|South Ossetia]] and [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|Abkhazia]] during the early 1990s, conflicts that have periodically reemerged, and Russia has accused Georgia of supporting Chechen rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen wars]]. A coup d'état installed former Communist leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as President of Georgia until the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003.
* {{flag|Armenia}}'s independence struggle included violence as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia became increasingly militarized (with the ascendancy of Kocharian, a former president of Nagorno-Karabakh, often viewed as a milestone), while elections have since been increasingly controversial, and government corruption became more rife. After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the "founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.
* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia. Azerbaijani KGB and Azerbaijani SSR leader [[Heydar Aliyev]] captured power and remained president until he transferred the presidency to his son in 2003. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has largely defined the fates of both countries. However, unlike Armenia, which remains a strong Russian ally, Azerbaijan has begun, since Russia's 2008 war with Georgia, to foster better relations with Turkey and other Western nations, while lessening ties with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chechnya ===
[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-women-pray.jpg|thumb|[[Chechen people|Chechen]] women praying in [[Grozny]], December 1994]]
In [[Chechnya]], using tactics partly copied from the Baltics, anti-Communist coalition forces led by former Soviet general [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing the resignation of the Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to his desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/05/2017/5915d8799a794757ef77f42e&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Asia ===
* {{flag|Kazakhstan|1991}}'s independence struggle began with the [[Jeltoqsan]] uprising in 1986. Former Communist leader [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has been in power since 1990 when he started serving as [[Kazakh SSR|President of Kazakh SSR]].
* {{flag|Kyrgyzstan|1991}}'s [[Askar Akayev]] retained power until the [[Tulip Revolution]] in 2005.
* {{flag|Tajikistan|1991}}'s [[Rahmon Nabiyev]] retained power, which led to the [[civil war in Tajikistan]]. [[Emomalii Rahmon]] has succeeded Nabiyev and has retained power since 1992.
* {{flag|Turkmenistan|1991}}'s [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] retained power until his death in 2006 and was criticized as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive leaders, maintaining his own [[cult of personality]].
* {{flag|Uzbekistan}}'s [[Islam Karimov]] retained power until his death in 2016, and was widely criticized for repressing the political opposition throughout his tenure.

=== Post-Soviet conflicts ===
Russia was involved in a number of conflicts, including the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the [[War of Transnistria]], the [[1991–1992 South Ossetia War]], the [[First Chechen War]], the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]], the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]], and the [[2014 Crimean Crisis|Crimea]] and [[War in Donbass|Donbass]] conflicts in Ukraine.

== Political reforms ==
{{main|Decommunization}}
Decommunization is a process of overcoming the legacies of the [[Communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-Communist states.

Decommunization was largely limited or non-existent. Communist parties were not outlawed and their members were not brought to trial. Just a few places even attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries the Communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After Socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several European countries, however, endorsing or attempting to justify crimes committed by Nazi or Communist regimes will be punishable by up to 3 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=888&amp;LID=2|title=This page does not / no longer exist|author=Anne Frank Stichting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic reforms ==
State run enterprises in socialist countries had little or no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt; In the early 1990s, the general view was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism",&lt;ref name="Havrylyshyn"/&gt; and only some elderly people remembered how a market economy worked. As result the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The world after 1989: Walls in the mind |work=The Economist | date=5 November 2009 | url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14793753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a temporary fall of output in the official economy and an increase in black market economic activity.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt;
Countries implemented different reform programs. One example, generally regarded as successful was the "shock therapy" [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in Poland. Eventually the official economy began to grow.&lt;ref name="aslund"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of Output Collapse after Communism | author=Anders Aslund | date=1 December 2000 | url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic liberalisation in India|Economic liberalization in India]] was initiated in 1991.

Harvard University Professor [[Richard B. Freeman]] has called the effect of reforms "The Great Doubling".

In the long, term China, India, and the former Soviet bloc will save and invest and contribute to the expansion of the world capital stock.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;

In 1992, President Yeltsin's government invited [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] to serve as an expert to testify at the [[CPSU]] trial by [[Constitutional Court]] of Russia, where the Communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their party. The respondent's case was that the [[CPSU]] itself had been an unconstitutional organization. To prepare for his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from Soviet archives (then reorganized into [[TsKhSD]]). Using a small handheld scanner and a laptop computer, he managed to secretly scan many documents (some with high [[security clearance]]), including [[KGB]] reports to the [[Central Committee]], and smuggle the files to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = JHU | contribution-url = http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html | contribution = Soviet Archives | title = Info-Russ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The event that many expected would be another [[Nuremberg Trial]] and the beginnings of reconciliation with the Communist past, ended up in half-measures: while the CPSU was found unconstitutional, the Communists were allowed to form new parties in the future. Bukovsky expressed his deep disappointment with this in his writings and interviews: "Having failed to finish off conclusively the Communist system, we are now in danger of integrating the resulting monster into our world. It may not be called Communism anymore, but it retained many of its dangerous characteristics... Until the Nuremberg-style tribunal passes its judgment on all the crimes committed by Communism, it is not dead and the war is not over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com./Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1589 | title = The Cold War and the War Against Terror | first = Jamie | last = Glazov | newspaper = Front Page | date = 1 July 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
The events caught many by surprise. [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|Predictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise]] had been often dismissed.&lt;ref name="melt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Cummins|title=The Great MeltDown|work=The Australian|date=23 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlomiej Kaminski's book ''The Collapse of State Socialism'' argued that the state Socialist system has a lethal paradox, saying that "policy actions designed to improve performance only accelerate its decay".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47325/robert-legvold/the-collapse-of-state-socialism | title = The Collapse of State Socialism | newspaper = Foreign Affairs}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].

[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Central and South-East Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe."&lt;ref name="fa90"&gt;{{Citation | first = Coit D | last = Blacker | title = The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe | journal = Foreign Affairs | year = 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism and the Warsaw Pact. Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been "absurd to keep the system" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had "no relevance to real life."&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
{{as of|2016|7|5}}, the [[United States Strategic Command]] tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,&lt;ref name=ODQN-201607&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv20i3.pdf |title=Orbital Debris Quarterly News |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=8 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,419 operational satellites.&lt;ref name=ucs&gt;{{cite web |title=UCS Satellite Database |date=11 August 2016 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Global Security |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are just objects large enough to be tracked. {{as of|July 2013}}, more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, about 670,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/How_many_space_debris_objects_are_currently_in_orbit "How many space debris objects are currently in orbit?"] ''ESA'', July 2013. Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

Below {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} Earth-[[orbital altitude|altitude]], pieces of debris are denser than [[meteoroid]]s; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from [[RORSAT]] (nuclear-powered satellites).

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J.

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L.

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J.

Although the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.&lt;ref name= Anselmo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anselmo | first1 = L. | last2 = Pardini | first2 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit | url = | journal = Space Debris | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 67–82 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021255523174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, the nature of the problem is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in [[geostationary transfer orbit]], are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [[European Space Agency]] telecom satellite [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure"&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html "The Olympus failure"] ''ESA press release'', 26 August 1993.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181644/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 March 2006, the Russian [[Express (satellite)|Express-AM11]] communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20320 "Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure"] ''Russian Satellite Communications Company'', 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

In 1958, the United States launched [[Vanguard I]] into a [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO). {{As of|2009|10}}, it, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest surviving man-made space objects still in orbit.&lt;ref name="usaweekend"&gt;Julian Smith, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070826/070826space.html#junk "Space Junk"]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''USA Weekend'', 26 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/nrl-vic031308.php Vanguard 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; In a catalog of known launches until July 2009, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] listed 902 operational satellites&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html "UCS Satellite Database"] ''Union of Concerned Scientists'', 16 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy,&lt;ref name=wiedemann2009&gt;C. Wiedemann et al, "Size distribution of NaK droplets for MASTER-2009", ''Proceedings of the 5th European Conference on Space Debris'', 30 March-2 April 2009, (ESA SP-672, July 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; forming additional debris.&lt;ref name=rossi1997&gt;A.

In characterizing the problem of space debris, it was learned that much debris was due to rocket upper stages (e.g. the [[Inertial Upper Stage]]) which end up in orbit, and break up due to decomposition of [[Passivation (spacecraft)|unvented]] unburned fuel.&lt;ref name=loftus1989&gt;{{cite book |last=Loftus|first=Joseph P. |title=Orbital Debris from Upper-stage Breakup |year=1989 |publisher=AIAA |page=227 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RehH7b_kmNEC |isbn=978-1-60086-376-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a major known impact event involved an (intact) [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] booster.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2" /&gt; Although NASA and the [[United States Air Force]] now require upper-stage passivation, other launchers{{vague|date=January 2016}} do not.

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

===== Space Shuttle missions =====

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but [[STS-125]] (the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] repair mission) at {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the [[2009 satellite collision]]). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most manned space activity takes place at altitudes below {{convert|800|to|1500|km|abbr=on}}, a Kessler syndrome cascade in that region would rain down into lower altitudes and the decay time scale is such that "the resulting [low Earth orbit] debris environment is likely to be too hostile for future space use".&lt;ref name=k9163&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bechara J.

When originally proposed in 2015, the [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb constellation]], initially planned to have ~700 satellites anticipated on orbit after 2018, would only state that they would re-enter the atmosphere within 25 years of retirement.&lt;ref name=sn20150615&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacenews.com/airbus-wins-oneweb-contract/ |title=OneWeb Taps Airbus To Build 900 Internet Smallsats |work=SpaceNews |accessdate=19 June 2015 |date=2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By October 2017, both OneWeb—and also SpaceX, with their large [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink constellation]]—had filed documents with the US [[FCC]] with more aggressive space debris mitigation plans.  Both companies committed to a deorbit plan for post-mission satellites which will explicitly move the satellites into orbits where they will reenter the Earth's atmosphere within approximately one year following end-of-life.&lt;ref name=ars20171004&gt;

With a "one-up, one-down" launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launchers would rendezvous with, capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902 /&gt; Another possibility is the [[Mission Extension Vehicle|robotic]] [[Space Infrastructure Servicing|refueling]] of satellites.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[geocentric orbit]] with a low-[[perigee]], thus ensuring rapid [[orbital decay]] and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies.  Such missions require the use of a small [[Apogee kick motor|kick stage]] to circularize the orbit, but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/03/rocket-lab-capitalize-test-flight-success-first-operational-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-removal ===
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris.&lt;ref name= Anselmo /&gt; Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit. This was done with the French [[SPOT (satellites)|Spot-1 satellite]], reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its altitude from {{convert|830|km|0|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|550|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Luc Moliner, [http://www.aiaa.org/spaceops2002archive/papers/SpaceOps02-P-T3-30.pdf "Spot-1 Earth Observation Satellite Deorbitation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116030335/http://www.aiaa.org/Spaceops2002Archive/papers/SpaceOps02-P-T3-30.pdf |date=16 January 2011 }}, AIAA, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.com/resources/downloads/data/spacecraft-digest/display.aspx?i=3352 "Spacecraft: Spot 3"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930142847/http://www.agi.com/resources/downloads/data/spacecraft-digest/display.aspx?i=3352 |date=30 September 2011 }}, agi, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an [[electrodynamic tether]] could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Christensen, [http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_tether_041117.html "The Terminator Tether Aims to Clean Up Low Earth Orbit"], space.com.

=== External removal ===
A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/experts-active-removal-key-countering-space-junk-threat#.Ub3dSuce2Zc "Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat"] Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

{{as of|2006}} the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost-effective.&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;{{outdated inline|date=December 2015}} Since then Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris, has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan |first=McHarg |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-08-aims-space-debris.html |title=Project aims to remove space debris |publisher=Phys.org |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, [[Spacecraft capture|capture]] it temporarily to attach a [[smallsat|smaller de-orbit satellite]] and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location.  The "mothership" would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for [[atmospheric entry]] or move it to a graveyard orbit.

==== Laser methods ====
The [[laser broom]] uses a ground-based [[laser]] to [[Ablation|ablate]] the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Campbell, [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection"], Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired20111026&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann|first=Adam |title=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ |accessdate=1 November 2011 |newspaper=Wired Science |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Bekey, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ESASP.393..699B Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers].", ''Second European Conference on Space Debris'', 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.&lt;ref name=srdc20000816&gt;Justin Mullins [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2426 "A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework."], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report.

The momentum of the laser-beam [[photon]]s could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=UKmail20110316&gt;James Mason et al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1690 "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance"], arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.&lt;ref name=sn20141125 /&gt; A proposal to replace the laser with an [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been made,&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model.

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

=== NORAD, Gabbard and Kessler ===
To avoid artificial space debris, many—but not all—research satellites are launched on [[elliptical orbit]]s with perigees inside Earth's atmosphere so they will destroy themselves. [[Willy Ley]] predicted in 1960 that "In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives".&lt;ref name="ley196008"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=August 1960 |title=How to Slay Dragons |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08#page/n55/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=57–72 |department=For Your Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) began compiling a database (the [[Space Object Catalog]]) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. [[NASA]] published modified versions of the database in [[two-line element set]],&lt;ref name="Hoots"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix Hoots | first1 = Paul Schumacher Jr. | last2 = Glover | first2 = Robert | year = | title = History of Analytical Orbit Modeling in the U.S. Space Surveillance System | url = | journal = Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 174–185 | doi=10.2514/1.9161| bibcode = 2004JGCD...27..174H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak [[bulletin board system]] re-published them.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kelso, [http://celestrak.com/NORAD/archives/ CelesTrak BBS: Historical Archives], 2-line elements dating to 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gabbard diagram.png|thumb|alt=Debris graph of altitude and orbital period|Gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the Chinese Long March 4 booster on 11 March 2000]]
The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

=== Follow-up studies ===
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of episode 4 ("Conflict") of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' includes routine missions for the disposal of spent satellites by bombing.

''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979 TV series) deals humorously with a scrap dealer who establish a space junk salvage company.

''[[Planetes]]'' is a manga (1999-2004) and anime series (2003-2004) that gives focus on a team which is responsible for the collection and disposal of space debris. The DVDs for the TV series include interviews with NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office.

{{other people||Stephen Williams (disambiguation)}}
'''Stephen Williams''' (31 March 1908 - 23 November 1994) was a British radio announcer, presenter and producer, and a pioneer of commercial radio for the UK.

Born in London and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a young boy he was already, in his words, a "wireless fanatic": he said, "I was able to listen proudly to the debut of the BBC on 14 November 1922, and from the moment I heard the announcer say "This is 2LO calling, 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company", I was seized with an ambition to have a job like his."

During his university vacation in 1928 he got a job as announcer on a "broadcasting yacht" sponsored by the Daily Mail newspaper group. This vessel went round the coast of Britain, transmitting music on records and advertisements for the Daily Mail, from just outside territorial waters, an early precursor of the 1960s "pirate radio" ships..

The broadcasting yacht had been the idea of the paper's Circulation and Publicity Director, Valentine Smith, who soon transferred to the Sunday Referee, where he gave Williams a job with the idea of involving the paper in commercial broadcasting. They were soon in contact with Captain [[Leonard F. Plugge]], who was starting the [[International Broadcasting Company]] (IBC).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Williams, "Pioneering commercial radio the D-I-Y way", ''European Journal of Marketing'', October 1987. {{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903160037/http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |archivedate=2003-09-03 |df= }} {{ISSN|0309-0566}} 
(journal title and date wrongly cited on web page).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1932, Williams was sent to France to join Max Staniforth at the IBC's new Radio Normandy service, broadcasting to the south of England.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Plomley, ''Days Seemed Longer: Early Years of a Broadcaster'', London, 1980, p.123. {{ISBN|0-413-39730-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings of two commercials read by Stephen Williams on Radio Normandy in 1932 are said to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Radio For Sale: Sponsored Programming in British Radio during the 1930s", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 1999. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/Street19991.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Williams moved on to a rival company to IBC, Radio Publicity, which started broadcasting to the UK from Radio Paris, then a much more powerful station than Radio Normandy, which rapidly gained a large British audience. But French listeners complained that their most popular station was now too dominated by English programmes, so Radio Publicity turned to the newly created [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], where it was able to gain the sole concession for English programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1933 Williams thus became the first English radio presenter in Luxembourg as well as serving as manager of the station.

Shortly before his death in 1994, Williams gave an interview to Roger Bickerton about his work at Radio Luxembourg which was published in ''The Historic Record and AV Collector'', Issues 39,40 and 41, April, June &amp; October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Recording Technologies and Strategies for British Radio Transmission Before the 2nd World War", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 2002. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/street002.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Luxembourg closed down on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Stephen Williams resumed his duties there when the station restarted in 1946. He left Luxembourg in 1948, and worked until 1975 as a freelance broadcaster.

When, on 1 January 1992, Radio Luxembourg's English service closed down as a terrestrial radio station, the last words heard, "Good luck, good listening ... and goodbye" were spoken by 83-year-old Stephen Williams, who had been the first person ever to say on the air "This is Radio Luxembourg" over 58 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"Last hours on 208m", aircheck available at playlist No 40 on ''The Station of the Stars: Audio Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was awarded the Order of Merit by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1992.

He collected a large archive of material related to Radio Luxembourg, much of which his widow has donated to the Centre for Luxembourg Studies at Sheffield University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html Department of Germanic Studies, University of Sheffield] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062114/http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html |date=2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipient of the 2016 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize==
The Task Force for Global Health received the 2016 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize during a symposium titled "The Future of Humanitarian Action" held at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/task-force-for-global-health-wins-2m-conrad-n-hilton-humanitarian-prize-worlds-largest-humanitarian-award-170335/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Wins $2M Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize, World's Largest Humanitarian Award |website=Christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was selected by a panel of independent international jurors for having made "contributions to improving the health of people living in extreme poverty.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2016/08/09/task-force-for-global-health-wins-2-million-hilton.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was co-founded by global health pioneer and former CDC Director, [[William Foege|Dr. William Foege]] and two of his former CDC colleagues, Carol Walters and Bill Watson. It was founded in 1984 as The Task Force for Child Survival.&lt;ref name="Foege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Foege |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-partners-in-fighting-disease/2012/11/22/f127b0e2-1f00-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_story.html |title=Global partners in fighting disease |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force was initially launched to foster collaboration among leading health and development agencies. Under the leadership of Dr. Foege, The Task Force brought together [[World Bank Group]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[United Nations Development Programme|The United Nations Development Programme]], [[WHO]], and [[UNICEF]], [[WHO]] to raise childhood immunization rates.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saportareport.com/task-force-global-health-receive-2016-2-million-prize-hilton-foundation/ |title=Task Force for Global Health to receive 2016 $2 million prize from Hilton Foundation |website=SaportaReport.com |date=2016-08-09 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, only 20 percent of children worldwide were receiving immunizations and 12,000 children, mostly in the world's poorest countries, were dying every day. By 1990, The Task Force had raised childhood immunization rates to 80 percent globally.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; Since then, The Task Force has used its strength and credibility in collaboration to positively affect a broad range of health issues affecting the world's poor.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt; In 2015, The Task Force celebrated 30 years of contributions to global health at an event that included [[World Bank Group]] President [[Jim Yong Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadership.saportareport.com/globalhealth/2015/10/15/the-task-force-for-global-health-celebrates-30-years-of-contributions-to-global-health/ |title=Task Force for Global Health Celebrates 30 Years &amp;#124; Global Health |website=Leadership.saportareport.com |date=2015-10-15 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The Task Force works with hundreds of partners to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases and increase access to medicines and vaccines for [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[influenza]], and [[cholera]]. Beginning with the Mectizan Donation Program,&lt;ref name="Foege"/&gt; The Task Force is credited with working with the pharmaceutical industry to donate billions of dollars annually in essential medicines for the control and elimination of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref name="globalatlanta1"/&gt;

Collaboration, health equity, and social justice are the cornerstones of all Task Force programs.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt; The organization is a major partner in the global effort to eliminate three neglected tropical diseases by 2025—blinding [[trachoma]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], and [[lymphatic filariasis]]—which collectively threaten hundreds of millions of people each year with blindness, disfigurement, and death.&lt;ref name="saportareport1"/&gt;

Information and laboratory technologies are vital tools in The Task Force's work to control and eliminate diseases and increase access to quality health care for people in developing countries.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpbnews.org/post/atlanta-considered-how-smartphones-and-science-could-help-eradicate-disease |title=Atlanta Considered: How Smartphones And Science Could Help Eradicate Disease &amp;#124; Georgia Public Broadcasting |website=Gpbnews.org |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a smartphone-based data collection system, The Task Force maps the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to determine where interventions should be implemented.&lt;ref name="gpbnews1"/&gt; It uses portable molecular technology and tablet-based systems to detect and diagnose NTDs within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wabe.org/post/closer-look-mayor-kasim-reed-santa-claus-and-more |title=Closer Look: Mayor Kasim Reed; Santa Claus; And More &amp;#124; WABE 90.1 FM |website=News.wabe.org |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses diverse technologies to help developing countries manage their healthcare workforce in order to meet the health needs of their populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2015/03/georgians-nation-stretch-health-resources/ |title=Georgians help a nation stretch its health resources |publisher=Georgia Health News |date=2015-03-23 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, The Task Force's Public Health Informatics Institute was named a partner on a new Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-funded initiative called the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Program (CHAMPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champshealth.org/|title=CHAMPS|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to understand and ultimately address the causes of death for children under 5 in developing countries.

In 2016, the Task Force helped launch a program called Digital Bridge which is developing an electronic case reporting system to improve information exchange between the public health and healthcare sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160827/MAGAZINE/308279979/commentary-stopping-zika-other-emerging-health-threats-requires|title=Commentary: Stopping Zika, other emerging health threats requires stronger surveillance systems|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and future==
In 2016, The Task Force reached an agreement to purchase a DeKalb County government building in downtown Decatur for a larger headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/global-health-organization-plans-expansion-dekalb/IJ3GYxKoKZg75q9EXc9L7I/|title=Task Force for Global Health may buy DeKalb government building|first=Mark|last=Niesse|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has begun examining how it might help address the growing epidemic of [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs) in developing countries.&lt;ref name="businesswire1"/&gt;

The actual construction was done by two Dutch (joint venture) specialist companies, Van Oord and Boskalis. The same companies also created the [[Palm Jumeirah]].

Construction of the 300 islands began in 2003, only to halt due to the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Sinking"&gt;{{cite news|title='The World' is sinking|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/international/4594274/The-World-is-sinking|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though 60 percent of the islands had been sold off to private contractors back in 2008, development on most of these islands has failed to initiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaffer|first1=Sierra|title=The "World" Is Sinking Back Into The Sea, Dubai's World Islands That Is – TechMalak|url=https://www.techmalak.com/the-world-is-sinking-back-into-the-sea-dubais-world-that-is/#.WS2awHXyukA|work=TechMalak|date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the Lebanon Island was developed and was the only island that had so far been developed commercially, being used for private corporate events and public parties. As of late 2013, only two of the islands had been developed. In January 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of "The Heart of Europe" project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/january2014/ |title= KLEINDIENST GROUP LAUNCHES ICONIC THE HEART OF EUROPE PROJECT|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= January 2014 |publisher= JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by February 2014, one of Kleindienst Group's brands - JK Properties - announced in their monthly newsletter that the project was "well underway".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/february2014/ |title= WORK CONTINUES TO PROGRESS AT A PACE ON THE HEART OF EUROPE  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= February 2014  |publisher= JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these series of islands will be Europe, Sweden and Germany with development led by Kleindienst Group.

==Project==
Islands in the project range from {{convert|14000|to|42000|m2|sqft}} in area.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; Distances between islands average {{convert|100|m|ft}}; they are constructed from {{convert|321,000,000|m3|abbr=out}} of sand and 386 million tons of rock.&lt;ref name="Progress Update"/&gt; Designed by [[Creative Kingdom Dubai]], the development is an area that covers {{convert|6|by|9|km|mi}} and is surrounded by an oval-shaped [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] island. Roughly {{convert|232|km|abbr=on}} of shoreline was created. The World's overall development costs were estimated at $13 billion [[Canadian Dollar|CAD]] in 2005.

The archipelago consists of seven sets of islands; [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Antarctica]], and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="Atlas Obscura 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=The World Islands | website=Atlas Obscura | date=September 26, 2016 | url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-islands | access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each artificial islands are named for their representative regions, including those representing [[countries]], [[landmarks]], and [[regions]] such as the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|186483481|United Kingdom}} {{coord|25.22334|N|55.15937|E|format=dec|name=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|2713321|California|tools=short}} {{coord|25.20300|N|55.14376|E|format=dec|name=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Everest]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87185503|Mount Everest}} {{coord|25.23683|N|55.17535|E|format=dec|name=Mount Everest}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87185938|Australia}} {{coord|25.23149|N|55.19435|E|format=dec|name=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|8402261|New Mexico}} {{coord|25.201379|N|55.151797|E|format=dec|name=New Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Upernavik]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87184344|Upernavik}} {{coord|25.22142|N|55.13939|E|format=dec|name=Upernavik}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|202033673|Buenos Aires}} {{coord|25.20106|N|55.1695|E|format=dec|name=Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|87184265|New York}} {{coord|25.21421|N|55.15101|E|format=dec|name=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|8402263|Mexico}} {{coord|25.201824|N|55.154394|E|format=dec|name=Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Petersburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|200489433|St. Petersburg}} {{coord|25.23475|N|55.16479|E|format=dec|name=St. Petersburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|w|170773643|India}} {{coord|25.23110|N|55.1796|E|format=dec|name=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world economic recovery from the [[Great Recession]] has resulted in a rebound for the Dubai real estate market: it has been reported that "residential prices [in Dubai] rose by 17.9% from August 2012 to 2013, while rents soared by 14.9% in the same period." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jk-properties.com/newsletters/november2013/|title=JK Properties Monthly Newsletter (Nov. 2013) "A BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR DUBAI’S PROPERTY MARKET" |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=November 2013 |publisher=JK Properties |accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World was supposed to be serviced by four major transportation hubs linked by waterways. Land parcels are supposedly zoned for various uses: estate, mid density, high density, resorts and commercial.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.ae/videoGallery.html | title=The World Video Gallery|author=Nakheel}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dubai Infinity Holdings construction planner has stated that developers have been negotiating with Nakheel about temporary siting of a cement batching plant on one of the islands to supply subdivided construction.&lt;ref name="national3quarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/property/the-world-three-quarters-sold-out|title=‘The World’ three-quarters sold out|author=The National Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was for utilities to be routed under water, with water plants at each of the hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai Grid and distributed through underwater cables, however as of February 2015 no cables had been laid, so that developers currently have to provide their own power from diesel generators. Waste water and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.&lt;ref name="video"/&gt;

Nakheel Group is itself further developing a resort named Coral Island over 20 islands that make up the North American part of The World. The low-rise development will include a marina and hotel village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uaeinteract.com/docs/Nakheel_unveils_super-luxury_resort_at_Coral_Island_of_The_World/25125.htm|title=Nakheel unveils super-luxury resort at Coral Island of The World |date=2007-03-05|publisher=National Media Council UAE|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second largest confirmed development is the purchase of 14 islands that make up Australia and New Zealand by Investment Dar of [[Kuwait]].  The islands are being [[terraforming|terraformed]] to be developed as a resort named [[OQYANA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatraveltips.com/news05/134-TheWorld.shtml|title=Nakheel sells Australasia segment of The World|date=2005-04-13|publisher=AsiaTravelTips.com|accessdate=2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish business consortium Larionovo had plans to develop the [[Ireland]] island into an Irish-themed resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandofireland.com/|title=The Island of Ireland|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans include a large internal marina, apartments and villas, a gym, hotel, and an Irish-themed pub. In July 2007 it was announced that the Ireland Island would feature a recreation of [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Giant's Causeway]]. However, on 25 November 2008 a provisional liquidator was appointed to Larionovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Tube Challenge''' is the competition for the fastest time to travel to all [[London Underground]] stations, tracked as a [[Guinness World Record]] since 1960. The goal is to visit all the stations on the system, not necessarily all the lines; participants may connect between stations on foot, or by using other forms of public transport.

{{As of|2016}}, the record for fastest completion was held by Andi James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK), who completed the challenge in 15 hours, 45 minutes and 38 seconds on 21 May 2015.&lt;ref name=alwakeel-20160106&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alwakeel|first1=Ramzy|title=Tube challenger reclaims world record for trip around all 270 stations|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/tube-challenger-claws-back-world-record-for-fastest-journey-around-all-270-stations-a3149961.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=Evening Standard|date=6 January 2016|quote=270 Tube stops in 15 hours and 45 minutes … Mr Wilson … and Mr James’s new record has taken eight months for Guinness World Records to ratify – the pair actually completed their run in May last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations|title=Fastest time to travel to all London Underground stations|quote=15 hr 45 min 38 sec, and was achieved by Andy James (Finland) and Steve Wilson (UK) in London, UK, on 21 May 2015.|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=11 March 2016|archivedate=4 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083335/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-time-to-travel-to-all-london-underground-stations/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first recorded challenge took place in 1959. Although many people have attempted the challenge and held the record since, they have not always been credited in the record books. In the earlier days of the challenge, participants were permitted to use private forms of transport (such as a car or bike) to move between stations. This led to times of less than 16 hours in some earlier records, and Guinness later changed the rules{{when|date=July 2011}} to ban private transport.

The following is a list of record holders that have appeared in the printed edition of the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]''. The record did not appear in the book until its eighth edition.

Between the 1960s and 1990s the record regularly appeared in the ''Guinness Book of Records'', initially listed under "Underground Railways – circuit of", but later just under "Railways" and then "Trains".  Since the change of publishing style of the book from the 2001 edition onwards, the record – although frequently broken – has only once appeared in printed form, in the 2008 edition. More recent records have tended to be published online instead. Since the record has not regularly been published in the book, there have been two broad configurations on the system – one for 275 stations, and one for 270 once the East London Line was no longer part of the network.

===275 stations===
On 3 April 2002 Jack Welsby set a new record time for 275 stations by traversing the system in 19 hours, 18 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|title=New record set on the tube|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=24 July 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305141751/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-433122-new-record-set-on-the-tube.do|archivedate=5 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsby made just one attempt, starting his route at Heathrow and finishing at Amersham.

This time was beaten on 4 May 2004 by [[Geoff Marshall]] and Neil Blake who achieved a new record time of 18 hours 35 minutes and 43 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/every-tube-station-in-18-hours-7235423.html|title=Every Tube station in 18 hours|newspaper=Evening Standard|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their attempt began on the first train out of [[Amersham station|Amersham]] on the Metropolitan Line and ended at [[Upminster station|Upminster]], and it took Guinness World Records four months to ratify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3700658.stm|title=Tube station visit record broken|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2004 | date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous attempt had been broadcast on TV as part of ''[[The Tube (2003 TV series)|The Tube]]'' TV series and another attempt had been televised as part of an ITV1 programme ''Metroland: Race Around the Underground'' on 16 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|title=Going down the tubes|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=17 October 2003|accessdate=27 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429143148/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7231700-going-down-the-tubes.do|archivedate=29 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this time stood for two years before being beaten by just five seconds, it was not until Håkan Wolgé and Lars Andersson (both from Sweden) set a new record time for 275 stations that it appeared in the ''Guinness World Records'' Book again, in the 2008 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2008"/&gt; They set a new record of 18 hours, 25 minutes and 3 seconds, on 26 September 2006.

===270 stations===
Changes to the total number of stations meant that the record was 'reset' and broken three more times over a two-year period until Wood Lane station opened in October 2008, and the network settled at 270 stations.

The first holders of the 270-station record were Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who, on 14 December 2009, achieved a record time of 16 hours, 44 minutes and 16 seconds.&lt;ref name=Southwest&gt;{{Cite news|title = Richard's going underground on charity mission|quote = ''[will] attempt to dethrone Andi James, Martin Hazel and Steve Wilson who set the benchmark on December 14, 2009.''|publisher = This Is Plymouth|date = 4 February 2010|url = http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|accessdate = 12 July 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614040236/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/Richard-s-going-underground-charity-mission/story-11837754-detail/story.html|archivedate = 14 June 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TfL used this route four years later as part of the Art on the Underground [[labyrinth]] project to mark the 150th anniversary of the [[London Underground]], installing permanent designs at stations in the same order that the world record route had taken, and later appeared in an ''Information Capital'' article.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Telegraph|title=How to do the Tube Challenge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11174269/How-to-do-the-Tube-Challenge.html|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record remained unbeaten for 17 months, until Marc Gawley from Denton, Greater Manchester, set a new time of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 57 seconds on 21 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|title=New world record for Denton man who travelled to all 270 London tube stations in under 17 hours|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1425496_new-world-record-for-denton-man-who-travelled-to-all-270-london-tube-stations-in-under-17-hours|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a fast marathon runner, he revealed that he did not use any buses on the day, preferring instead to make all his connections on foot. Gawley's record was beaten 37 days later, when James and Wilson completed the challenge in just 44 seconds under Gawley's time, setting a new record of 16 hours, 29 minutes and 13 seconds on 27 May 2011.&lt;ref name="James-Wilson-Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2013"/&gt;

This record stood for over two years until August 2013, before being broken by previous record holder [[Geoff Marshall]] who along with Anthony Smith, completed the challenge in 16 hours, 20 minutes and 27 seconds,&lt;ref name="bbc2013"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=London Tube Station Visiting Record Broken|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24203949|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Londonist|title=New world record for Tube Challenges|url=http://londonist.com/2013/09/new-world-record-for-tube-challenge.php|accessdate=23 September 2013 |date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the record time was then published for the first time in seven years in the ''Guinness World Records'' in the 2015 edition.&lt;ref name="gbr2015"/&gt;

Clive Burgess and Ronan McDonald set a new Guinness world record time of 16 hours, 14 minutes and 10 seconds on 21 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Brighton Argus|title=For the record, world was enthusiats's Oyster card|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/12901532.For_the_record__world_was_enthusiast___s_Oyster__card_/|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken later that year, on 21 May, by previous record holders Andi James and Steve Wilson, in a time of 15 hours 45 minutes 38 seconds.&lt;ref name="guinnessworldrecords.com"/&gt;

==Other attempts==

Attempts to travel the network have been linked to charities such as Children in Need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wear/hi/front_page/newsid_9184000/9184337.stm|title=Pudsey Challenge 2010|publisher=BBC Sunderland|date = 12 November 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/going_underground_1_2769466|title=Going Underground|newspaper=Sunderland Echo|date = 26 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Comic Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesthegill.blogspot.com/2009/03/red-nose-day-tube-challenge-2009.html|title=Aiming to misbehave|date = 14 March 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charity attempt known as "Tube Relief" was organised, following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], to raise money for the [[London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund]].

'''World-systems theory''' (also known as '''world-systems analysis''' or '''the world-systems perspective''')&lt;ref name=IW&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein, (2004), "World-systems Analysis." In ''World System History'', ed. George Modelski, in ''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems'' (EOLSS), Developed under the Auspices of the UNESCO, Eolss Publishers, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt; is a multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to [[world history]] and [[social change]] which emphasizes the [[world-system]] (and not [[nation state]]s) as the primary (but not exclusive) unit of [[social analysis]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

"World-system" refers to the inter-regional and transnational [[division of labor]], which divides the world into [[core countries]], [[semi-periphery countries]], and the [[periphery countries]].&lt;ref name=TB&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The dictionary of anthropology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Print, p.498-499]&lt;/ref&gt; Core countries focus on higher skill, [[Capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive production, and the rest of the world focuses on low-skill, labor-intensive production and extraction of [[raw material]]s.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; This constantly reinforces the dominance of the core countries.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; Nonetheless, the system has dynamic characteristics, in part as a result of revolutions in [[transport]] technology, and individual states can gain or lose their core (semi-periphery, periphery) status over time.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; This structure is unified by the division of labour. It is a world-economy rooted in a capitalist economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World-systems analysis: An introduction|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel Maurice|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=23–24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, certain countries become the world [[hegemon]]; during the last few centuries, as the world-system has extended geographically and intensified economically, this status has passed from the [[Netherlands]], to the [[United Kingdom]] and (most recently) to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;

==Background==

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] has developed the best-known version of world-systems analysis, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1974). The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH&gt;Paul Halsall [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/wallerstein.html Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory], August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Wallerstein traces the rise of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] world-economy from the "long" 16th century (c. 1450–1640). The rise of capitalism, in his view, was an accidental outcome of the protracted crisis of feudalism (c. 1290–1450).&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1992). "The West, Capitalism, and the Modern World-System", Review 15 (4), 561-619; also Wallerstein, The Modern World-System I, chapter one; Moore, Jason W. (2003) "[http://www.jasonwmoore.com/uploads/Moore__The_Modern_World-System_as_Environmental_History__Theory___Society__2003_.pdf The Modern World-System as Environmental History?] Ecology and the rise of Capitalism," Theory &amp; Society 32(3), 307–377.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe ([[Western world|the West]]) used its advantages and gained control over most of the world economy and presided over the development and spread of [[industrialization]] and capitalist economy, indirectly resulting in [[international inequality|unequal development]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

Though other commentators refer to Wallerstein's project as world-systems "theory", he consistently rejects that term.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. ''The Uncertainties of Knowledge''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallerstein, world-systems analysis is a mode of analysis that aims to transcend the structures of knowledge inherited from the 19th century, especially the definition of capitalism, the divisions within the social sciences, and those between the social sciences and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin Y.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London and New Delhi|pages=169–199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallerstein, then, world-systems analysis is a "knowledge movement"&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. 2004a. "World-Systems Analysis." In ''World System History: Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems'', edited by George Modelski. Oxford: UNESCO/EOLSS Publishers, http://www.eolss.net.&lt;/ref&gt; that seeks to discern the "totality of what has been paraded under the labels of the... human sciences and indeed well beyond".&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, ''The Uncertainties of Knowledge'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; "We must invent a new language," Wallerstein insists, to transcend the illusions of the "three supposedly distinctive arenas" of society, economy and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1991. "Beyond Annales," ''Radical History Review'', no. 49, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The trinitarian structure of knowledge is grounded in another, even grander, modernist architecture, the distinction of biophysical worlds (including those within bodies) from social ones: "One question, therefore, is whether we will be able to justify something called social science in the twenty-first century as a separate sphere of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1995. "What Are We Bounding, and Whom, When We Bound Social Research?" ''Social Research'' 62(4):839–856.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. 2011. 2011. "Ecology, Capital, and the Nature of Our Times:  Accumulation &amp; Crisis in the Capitalist World-Ecology," ''Journal of World-Systems Analysis'' 17(1), 108-147, {{cite web |url=http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510142258/http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other scholars have contributed significant work in this "knowledge movement".&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

==Origins==

===Influences and major thinkers===
World-systems theory traces emerged in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Its roots can be found in [[sociology]], but it has developed into a highly interdisciplinary field.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
World-systems theory was aiming to replace [[modernization theory]], which Wallerstein criticised for three reasons:&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
# its focus on the [[nation state]] as the only [[unit of analysis]]
# its assumption that there is only [[sociocultural evolution|a single path of evolutionary development for all countries]]
# its disregard of transnational structures that constrain local and national development.

There are three major predecessors of world-systems theory: the Annales school, the Marxist tradition, and the dependence theory.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAMV&gt;Carlos A. Martínez-Vela, [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/WorldSystem.pdf World Systems Theory], paper prepared for the [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/NewNotebook.htm Research Seminar in Engineering Systems], November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[Annales School]]''' tradition (represented most notably by [[Fernand Braudel]]) influenced Wallerstein to focusing on [[longue durée|long-term processes]] and geo-ecological regions as [[unit of analysis]]. '''[[Marxism]]''' added a stress on [[social conflict]], a focus on the [[capital accumulation]] process and competitive [[class struggle]]s, a focus on a relevant totality, the transitory nature of social forms and a [[dialectic]]al sense of motion through conflict and contradiction.

World-systems theory was also significantly influenced by '''[[dependency theory]]''', a [[neo-Marxist]] explanation of development processes.

Other influences on the world-systems theory come from scholars such as [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]]&lt;ref&gt;Kondratieff Waves in the World System Perspective. ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=336&amp;Itemid=1 Kondratieff Waves. Dimensions and Perspectives at the Dawn of the 21st Century]'' / Ed. by Leonid E. Grinin, Tessaleno C. Devezas, and Andrey V. Korotayev. Volgograd: Uchitel, 2012. P. 23–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (particularly their research on [[business cycles]] and the concepts of three basic modes of economic organization: reciprocal, redistributive, and market modes, which Wallerstein reframed into a discussion of mini systems, world empires, and world economies).

Wallerstein sees the development of the capitalist world economy as detrimental to a large proportion of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1983). Historical Capitalism. London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallerstein views the period since the 1970s as an "age of transition" that will give way to a future world system (or world systems) whose configuration cannot be determined in advance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hopkins|Hopkins, Terence K.]], and Immanuel Wallerstein, coordinators (1996). ''The Age of Transition''. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems thinkers include [[Samir Amin]], [[Giovanni Arrighi]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], with major contributions by [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], [[Beverly Silver]], [[Volker Bornschier]], [[Janet Abu Lughod]], [[Thomas D. Hall]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], [[Theotonio dos Santos]], Dale Tomich, Jason W. Moore and others.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; In sociology, a primary alternative perspective is [[World Polity Theory]], as formulated by [[John W. Meyer]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Dependency theory===
{{Main article|Dependency theory}}
World-systems analysis builds upon but also differs fundamentally from [[dependency theory]]. While accepting world inequality, the world market and imperialism as fundamental features of historical capitalism, Wallerstein broke with orthodox dependency theory's central proposition. For Wallerstein, core countries do not exploit poor countries for two basic reasons.

Firstly, core capitalists exploit workers in all zones of the capitalist world economy (not just the periphery) and therefore, the crucial redistribution between core and periphery is surplus value, not "wealth" or "resources" abstractly conceived. Secondly, core states do not exploit poor states, as dependency theory proposes, because capitalism is organised around an inter-regional and transnational division of labor rather than an international division of labour.

During the Industrial Revolution, for example, English capitalists exploited slaves (unfree workers) in the cotton zones of the American South, a peripheral region within a semiperipheral country, United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1989). The Modern World-System III. San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

From a largely Weberian perspective, [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] described the main tenets of dependency theory as follows:

* There is a financial and technological penetration of the [[periphery countries|periphery]] and [[semi-periphery countries]] by the developed capitalist [[core countries]].
* That produces an unbalanced economic structure within the peripheral societies and between them and the central countries.
* That leads to limitations upon self-sustained growth in the periphery.
* That helps the appearance of specific patterns of class relations.
* They require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso, F. H. (1979). Development under Fire. Mexico D.F.: Instituto Latinoamericano de Estudios Transnacionales, DEE/D/24 i, Mayo (Mexico 20 D.F., Apartado 85 - 025).

MNC Penetration and Contemporary Shifts in the Global Political Economy], September 2009, IZA Discussion Paper No. 4393&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency and world system theory propose that the [[poverty]] and backwardness of poor countries are caused by their peripheral position in the international [[division of labor]]. Since the capitalist world system evolved, the distinction between the central and the peripheral nations has grown and diverged. In recognizing a tripartite pattern in division of labor, world-systems analysis criticized [[dependency theory]] with its bimodal system of only cores and peripheries.

===Immanuel Wallerstein===
The best-known version of the world-systems approach was developed by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Wallerstein notes that world-systems analysis calls for an unidisciplinary historical social science and contends that the modern disciplines, products of the 19th century, are deeply flawed because they are not separate logics, as is manifest for example in the ''de facto'' overlap of analysis among scholars of the disciplines.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Wallerstein offers several definitions of a [[world-system]], defining it in 1974 briefly:

{{quote|a system is defined as a unit with a single division of labor and multiple cultural systems.&lt;ref name="Wallerstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|date=Sep 1974|title=Wallerstein. 1974. "The Rise and Future Demise of the World-Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis|journal=[[Comparative Studies in Society and History]]|volume=16|issue=4|page=390|url=http://bev.berkeley.edu/ipe/readings/Wallerstein.pdf}} Cited after [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also offered a longer definition:

{{quote|...a social system, one that has boundaries, structures, member groups, rules of legitimation, and coherence. Its life is made up of the conflicting forces which hold it together by tension and tear it apart as each group seeks eternally to remold it to its advantage. It has the characteristics of an organism, in that it has a life-span over which its characteristics change in some respects and remain stable in others. One can define its structures as being at different times strong or weak in terms of the internal logic of its functioning.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) ''The Modern World-System'', New York, Academic Press, pp. 347-57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1987, Wallerstein again defined it:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;not the system of the world, but a system that is a world and which can be, most often has been, located in an area less than the entire globe. World-systems analysis argues that the units of social reality within which we operate, whose rules constrain us, are for the most part such world-systems (other than the now extinct, small minisystems that once existed on the earth). World-systems analysis argues that there have been thus far only two varieties of world-systems: world-economies and world empires. A world-empire (examples, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Han China]]) are large bureaucratic structures with a single political center and an axial division of labor, but multiple cultures. A world-economy is a large axial division of labor with multiple political centers and multiple cultures. In English, the hyphen is essential to indicate these concepts. "World system" without a hyphen suggests that there has been only one world-system in the history of the world.|&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

Wallerstein characterises the world system as a set of mechanisms, which redistributes surplus value from the ''[[periphery countries|periphery]]'' to the ''[[core countries|core]]''. In his terminology, the ''core'' is the developed, [[industrialized]] part of the world, and the ''periphery'' is the "[[underdeveloped]]", typically raw materials-exporting, poor part of the world; the ''market'' being the means by which the ''core'' exploits the ''periphery''.

Apart from them, Wallerstein defines four temporal features of the world system. ''Cyclical rhythms'' represent the short-term fluctuation of [[economy]], and ''secular trends'' mean deeper long run tendencies, such as general [[economic growth]] or decline.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; The term ''contradiction'' means a general controversy in the system, usually concerning some short term versus long term tradeoffs. For example, the problem of [[underconsumption]], wherein the driving down of wages increases the profit for capitalists in the short term, but in the long term, the decreasing of wages may have a crucially harmful effect by reducing the demand for the product. The last temporal feature is the ''crisis'': a crisis occurs if a constellation of circumstances brings about the end of the system.

In Wallerstein's view, there have been three kinds of historical systems across human history: "mini-systems" or what anthropologists call bands, tribes, and small chiefdoms, and two types of world systems, one that is politically unified and the other is not (single state world [[empire]]s and multi-polity world economies).&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; World systems are larger, and are ethnically diverse. Modernity is unique in being the first and only fully capitalist world economy to have emerged around 1450 to 1550 and to have [[geography|geographically]] expanded across the entire planet, by about 1900. Not being political unified, many political units are included within the world system loosely tied together in an interstate system. Efficient division of labor is the unifying element of the different units, and it is also a function of capitalism, a system based on [[competition]] between free producers using [[wage labour|free labor]] with free commodities, 'free' meaning available for sale and purchase on a [[market (economics)|market]]. More specifically, it can be described as focusing on endless accumulation of capital; in other words, accumulation of capital in order to accumulate more capital. Such capitalism has a mutually dependent relationship with the world economy since it provides the efficient division of labour, the unifying element of the world economy, through the process of accumulating wealth. Likewise, such capitalism is dependent on the world economy since the latter provides a large market and a multiplicity of states, enabling capitalists to choose to work with states helping their interests.&lt;ref name=IW-D /&gt;

===Research questions===
World-systems theory asks several key questions:

* How is the world system affected by changes in its components (e.g. nations, ethnic groups, social classes, etc.)?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* How does it affect its components?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* To what degree, if any, does the core need the periphery to be underdeveloped?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* What causes world systems to change?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* What system may replace capitalism?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

Some questions are more specific to certain subfields; for example, [[Marxist]]s would concern themselves whether world-systems theory is a useful or unhelpful development of Marxist theories.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{See also|Core-periphery}}

World-systems analysis argues that capitalism, as a historical system, has always integrated a variety of labor forms within a functioning division of labor (world economy). Countries do not have economies but are part of the world economy. Far from being separate societies or worlds, the world economy manifests a tripartite [[division of labor]], with core, semiperipheral and peripheral zones. In the core zones, businesses, with the support of states they operate within, monopolise the most profitable activities of the division of labor.

There are many ways to attribute a specific country to the core, semi-periphery, or periphery. Using an empirically based sharp formal definition of "[[wikt:domination|domination]]" in a two-country relationship, Piana in 2004 defined the "core" as made up of "free countries" dominating others without being dominated, the "semi-periphery" as the countries that are dominated (usually, but not necessarily, by core countries) but at the same time dominating others (usually in the periphery) and "periphery" as the countries dominated. Based on 1998 data, the full list of countries in the three regions, together with a discussion of methodology, can be found.

The late 18th and early 19th centuries marked a great turning point in the development of capitalism in that capitalists achieved state society power in the key states, which furthered the industrial revolution marking the rise of capitalism. World-systems analysis contends that capitalism as a historical system formed earlier and that countries do not "develop" in stages, but the system does, and events have a different meaning as a phase in the development of historical capitalism, the emergence of the three ideologies of the national developmental mythology (the idea that countries can develop through stages if they pursue the right set of policies): conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism.

Proponents of world-systems analysis see the world stratification system the same way [[Karl Marx]] viewed class (ownership versus nonownership of the means of production) and [[Max Weber]] viewed class (which, in addition to ownership, stressed occupational skill level in the production process). The core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks. The periphery nations own very little of the world's means of production (even when they are located in periphery nations) and provide less-skilled labour. Like a class system with a nation, class positions in the [[world economy]] result in an unequal distribution of rewards or resources. The core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the smallest share. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from non-core nations at low prices and demand higher prices for their exports to non-core nations. Chirot (1986) lists the five most important benefits coming to core nations from their domination of periphery nations:

# Access to a large quantity of raw material
# Cheap labour
# Enormous profits from direct [[capital investments]]
# A market for [[exports]]
# Skilled professional labor through [[human migration|migration]] of these people from the non-core to the core.&lt;ref name=chirot1986&gt;Chirot, Daniel. 1986. ''Social Change in the Modern Era.'' New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wallerstein, the unique qualities of the modern world system include its capitalistic nature, its truly global nature, and the fact that it is a world economy that has not become politically unified into a world empire.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

===Core nations===
{{Main article|core countries}}
* Are the most economically diversified, wealthy, and powerful (economically and militarily)&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have strong central governments, controlling extensive bureaucracies and powerful militaries&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have stronger and more complex state institutions that help manage economic affairs internally and externally
* Have a sufficient tax base so state institutions can provide infrastructure for a strong economy
* Highly industrialised and produce manufactured goods rather than raw materials for export&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Increasingly tend to specialise in information, finance and service industries
* More often in the forefront of new technologies and new industries. Examples today include high-technology electronic and biotechnology industries. Another example would be assembly-line auto production in the early 20th century.
* Has strong [[bourgeois]] and [[working class]]es&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Have significant means of influence over non-core nations&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Relatively independent of outside control

Throughout the history of the modern world system, there has been a group of core nations competing with one another for access to the world's resources, economic dominance and [[hegemony]] over periphery nations. Occasionally, there has been one core nation with clear dominance over others.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; According to Immanuel Wallerstein, a core nation is dominant over all the others when it has a lead in three forms of economic dominance over a period of time:

# '''''Productivity dominance''''' allows a country to produce products of greater quality at a cheaper price, compared to other countries.
# Productivity dominance may lead to '''''trade dominance.''''' Now, there is a favorable balance of trade for the dominant nation since more countries are buying the products of the dominant country than buying from them.
# Trade dominance may lead to '''''financial dominance'''''. Now, more money is coming into the country than going out. Bankers of the dominant nation tend to receive more control of the world's financial resources.&lt;ref name=wallerstein1980&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1980. The Modern World System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600-1750. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military]] dominance is also likely after a nation reaches these three rankings. However, it has been posited that throughout the modern world system, no nation has been able to use its military to gain economic dominance. Each of the past dominant nations became dominant with fairly small levels of military spending and began to lose economic dominance with military expansion later on.&lt;ref name=kennedy1987&gt;Kennedy, Paul. 1987. ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict From 1500 to 2000.'' New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, cores were found in Northwestern Europe (England, France, Netherlands) but were later in other parts of the world (such as the United States, Canada, and Australia).&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

===Peripheral nations===
{{Main article|Periphery countries}}
* Are the least economically diversified
* Have relatively weak governments&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have relatively weak institutions, with tax bases too small to support infrastructural development
* Tend to depend on one type of economic activity, often by extracting and exporting raw materials to core nations&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Tend to be the least industrialized&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Are often targets for investments from [[multinational corporation|multinational]] (or [[international corporation|transnational]]) [[corporation]]s from core nations that come into the country to exploit cheap unskilled labor in order to export back to core nations
* Have a small bourgeois and a large peasant classes&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Tend to have populations with high percentages of poor and uneducated people
* Tend to have very high social inequality because of small upper classes that own most of the land and have profitable ties to multinational corporations
* Tend to be extensively influenced by core nations and their multinational corporations and often forced to follow economic policies that help core nations and harm the long-term economic prospects of peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

Historically, peripheries were found outside Europe, such as in [[Latin America]] and today in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

===Semi-peripheral nations===
{{Main article|Semiperiphery countries}}
Semi-peripheral nations are those that are midway between the core and periphery.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Thus, they have to keep themselves from falling into the category of peripheral nations and at the same time, they strive to join the category of core nations. Therefore, they tend to apply protectionist policies most aggressively among the three categories of nations.&lt;ref name=IW-D&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel Maurice. "The Modern World System as a Capitalist World-Economy." ''World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction.'' Durham: Duke UP, 2004. 23-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies. These regions often have relatively developed and diversified economies but are not dominant in international trade.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; They tend to export more to peripheral nations and import more from core nations in trade. According to some scholars, such as Chirot, they are not as subject to outside manipulation as peripheral societies; but according to others (Barfield), they have "periperial-like" relations to the core.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=chirot1977&gt;Chirot, Daniel. 1977. Social Change in the Twentieth Century. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the sphere of influence of some cores, semiperipheries also tend to exert their own control over some peripheries.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Further, semi-peripheries act as buffers between cores and peripheries&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; and thus "...partially deflect the political pressures which groups primarily located in peripheral areas might otherwise direct against core-states" and stabilise the world system.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;

Semi-peripheries can come into existence from developing peripheries and declining cores.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Historically, two examples of semiperipheral nations would be Spain and Portugal, which fell from their early core positions but still managed to retain influence in Latin America.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Those countries imported silver and gold from their American colonies but then had to use it to pay for manufactured goods from core countries such as England and France.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; In the 20th century, nations like the "settler colonies" of Australia, Canada and New Zealand had a semiperipheral status. In the 21st century, nations like Brazil, Russia, India, Israel, China, South Korea and South Africa (BRICS) are usually considered semiperipheral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External areas===
External areas are those that maintain socially necessary divisions of labor independent of the capitalist world economy.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

==Interpretation of world history==
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|400px|The 13th century world-system]]
Before the 16th century, [[Europe]] was dominated by [[feudal]] economies.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; European economies grew from mid-12th to 14th century but from 14th to mid 15th century, they suffered from a major crisis.&lt;ref name=glob&gt;Frank Lechner, [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html Globalization theories: World-System Theory], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Wallerstein explains this crisis as caused by the following:
# stagnation or even decline of agricultural production, increasing the burden of peasants,
# decreased agricultural productivity caused by changing climatological conditions ([[Little Ice Age]]),
# an increase in epidemics ([[Black Death]]),
# optimum level of the feudal economy having been reached in its [[economic cycle]]; the economy moved beyond it and entered a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] period.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt;

As a response to the failure of the feudal system, Europe embraced the capitalist system.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Europeans were motivated to develop technology to explore and trade around the world, using their superior military to take control of the trade routes.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; Europeans exploited their initial small advantages, which led to an accelerating process of accumulation of wealth and power in Europe.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

Wallerstein notes that never before had an economic system encompassed that much of the world, with trade links crossing so many political boundaries.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; In the past, geographically large economic systems existed but were mostly limited to spheres of domination of large empires (such as the [[Roman Empire]]); development of capitalism enabled the world economy to extend beyond individual states.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; [[International division of labor]] was crucial in deciding what relationships exists between different regions, their labor conditions and political systems.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; For classification and comparison purposes, Wallerstein introduced the categories of core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external countries.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Cores monopolized the capital-intensive production, and the rest of the world could provide only workforce and raw resources.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; The resulting inequality reinforced existing unequal development.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

According to Wallerstein there have only been three periods in which a core nation dominated in the modern world-system, with each lasting less than one hundred years. In the initial centuries of the rise of Europe, Northwestern Europe constituted the core, Mediterranean Europe the semiperiphery, and Eastern Europe and the Western hemisphere (and parts of Asia) the periphery.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Around 1450, Spain and Portugal took the early lead when conditions became right for a capitalist world-economy. They led the way in establishing overseas colonies. However, Portugal and Spain lost their lead, primarily by becoming overextended with [[empire]]-building. It became too expensive to dominate and protect so many colonial territories around the world.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chirot1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallerstein1974&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1974. ''The Modern World System: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the 16th Century.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fleuten 1647.jpg|right|thumb|Dutch [[fluyt]]s of the seventeenth century]]
The first nation to gain clear dominance was the Netherlands in the 17th century, after its revolution led to a new financial system that many historians consider revolutionary.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; An impressive [[shipbuilding]] industry also contributed to their economic dominance through more exports to other countries.&lt;ref name="chirot1986" /&gt; Eventually, other countries began to copy the financial methods and efficient production created by the Dutch. After the Dutch gained their dominant status, the [[standard of living]] rose, pushing up production costs.&lt;ref name="wallerstein1980" /&gt;

Dutch [[bankers]] began to go outside of the country seeking profitable investments, and the flow of [[capital (economics)|capital]] moved, especially to England.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; By the end of the 17th century, conflict among core nations increased as a result of the economic decline of the Dutch. Dutch [[financial investment]] helped England gain [[productivity]] and trade dominance, and Dutch military support helped England to defeat France, the other country competing for dominance at the time.

[[File:British Empire 1921.png|left|400px|thumb|Map showing the British Empire in 1921]]
In the 19th century, Britain replaced the Netherlands as the hegemon.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; As a result of the new British dominance, the world system became relatively stable again during the 19th century. The British began to expand globally, with many colonies in the New World, Africa, and Asia. The colonial system began to place a strain on the British military and, along with other factors, led to an economic decline. Again there was a great deal of core conflict after the British lost their clear dominance. This time it was Germany, and later Italy and Japan that provided the new threat.

[[Industrialization]] was another ongoing process during British dominance, resulting in the diminishing importance of the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; In the 18th century, Britain was Europe's leading industrial and agricultural producer; by 1900, only 10% of England's population was working in the [[agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=PH /&gt;

By 1900, the modern world system appeared very different from that of a century earlier in that most of the periphery societies had already been colonised by one of the older core nations.&lt;ref name="chirot1986" /&gt; In 1800, the old European core claimed 35% of the world's territory, but by 1914, it claimed 85% of the world's territory, with the [[Scramble for Africa]] closing out the imperial era.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; If a core nation wanted periphery areas to exploit as had done the Dutch and British, these periphery areas had to be taken from another core nation, which the US did by way of the [[Spanish–American War]], and Germany, and then Japan and Italy, attempted to do in the leadup to [[World War II]]. The modern world system was thus geographically global, and even the most remote regions of the world had all been integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref name=TB /&gt;&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

As countries vied for core status, so did the United States. The [[American Civil War]] led to more power for the Northern industrial elites, who were now better able to pressure the government for policies helping industrial expansion. Like the Dutch bankers, British bankers were putting more investment toward the United States. The US had a small [[military budget]] compared to other industrial nations at the time.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;

The US began to take the place of the British as a new dominant nation after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; With Japan and Europe in ruins after [[World War II]], the US was able to dominate the modern world system more than any other country in history, while the [[USSR]] and to a lesser extent China were viewed as primary threats.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; At its height, US economic reach accounted for over half of the world's industrial production, owned two thirds of the [[gold reserves]] in the world and supplied one third of the world's exports.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;

However, since the end of the [[Cold War]], the future of US hegemony has been questioned by some scholars, as its hegemonic position has been in decline for a few decades.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; By the end of the 20th century, the core of the wealthy industrialized countries was composed of Western Europe, the United States, Japan and a rather limited selection of other countries.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; The semiperiphery was typically composed of independent states that had not achieved Western levels of influence, while poor [[decolonization|former colonies]] of the West formed most of the periphery.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

==Criticisms==
World-systems theory has attracted criticisms from its rivals; notably for being too focused on economy and not enough on [[culture]] and for being too core-centric and state-centric.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; [[William I. Robinson]] has criticized world-systems theory for its nation-state centrism, state-structuralist approach, and its inability to conceptualize the rise of globalization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|date=2011-11-01|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|url=http://iss.sagepub.com/content/26/6/723|journal=International Sociology|language=en|volume=26|issue=6|pages=723–745|doi=10.1177/0268580910393372|issn=0268-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson suggests that world-systems theory doesn't account for emerging transnational social forces and the relationships forged between them and global institutions serving their interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These forces operate on a global, rather than state system and cannot be understood by Wallerstein's nation-centered approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Wallerstein himself, critique of the world-systems approach comes from four directions: the positivists, the orthodox Marxists, the state autonomists, and the culturalists.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The positivists criticise the approach as too prone to [[generalization]], lacking [[quantitative data]] and failing to put forth a [[falsifiable]] proposition.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Orthodox Marxists find the world-systems approach deviating too far from orthodox Marxist principles, such as by not giving enough weight to the concept of [[social class]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The state autonomists criticize the theory for blurring the boundaries between state and businesses.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Further, the positivists and the state autonomists argue that state should be the central [[unit of analysis]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Finally, the culturalists argue that world-systems theory puts too much importance on the economy and not enough on the culture.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; In Wallerstein's own words:

{{quote|In short, most of the criticisms of world-systems analysis criticize it for what it explicitly proclaims as its perspective. World-systems analysis views these other modes of analysis as defective and/or limiting in scope and calls for unthinking them.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

One of the fundamental conceptual problems of the world-system theory is that the assumptions that define its actual conceptual units are social systems. The assumptions, which define them, need to be examined as well as how they are related to each other and how one changes into another. The essential argument of the world-system theory is that in the 16th century a capitalist world economy developed, which could be described as a world system.&lt;ref name="Pieterse"&gt;Jan Nederveen Pieterse,  A Critique of World System Theory, in International Sociology, Volume 3, Issue no. 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a theoretical critique concerned with the basic claims of world-system theory:
"There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form." (Wallerstein 1979)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt;

Robert Brenner has pointed out that the prioritization of the world market means the neglect of local class structures and class struggles:
"They fail to take into account either the way in which these class structures themselves emerge as the outcome of class struggles whose results are incomprehensible in terms merely of market forces." (Brenner 1982)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt; Robert Brenner: Director of the Center for Social Theory and Comparative History at UCLA

Another criticism is that of reductionism made by Theda Skocpol: she believes the interstate system is far from being a simple superstructure of the capitalist world economy:
"The international states system as a transnational structure of military competition was not originally created by capitalism. Throughout modern world history, it represents an analytically autonomous level [... of] world capitalism, but [is] not reducible to it." (Skocpol 1979)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt;

A concept that we can perceive as critique and mostly as renewal is the concept of coloniality ([[Anibal Quijano]], 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unc.edu/~aescobar/wan/wanquijano.pdf|title=Quijano, 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America|author=|date=|website=unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Issued from the think tank of the group "modernity/coloniality" ([[:es:Grupo modernidad/colonialidad]]) in Latin America, it re-uses the concept of world working division and core/periphery system in its system of coloniality. But criticizing the "core-centric" origin of World-system and its only economical development, "coloniality" allows further conception of how power still processes in a colonial way over worldwide populations (Ramon Grosfogel, "the epistemic decolonial turn" 2007 &lt;ref&gt;Ramon Grosfogel, "the epistemic decolonial turn", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;):" by "colonial situations" I mean the cultural, political, sexual, spiritual, epistemic and economic oppression/exploitation of subordinate racialized/ethnic groups by dominant racialized/ethnic groups with or without the existence of colonial administration". Coloniality covers, so far, several fields such as coloniality of gender ([[Maria Lugones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalstudies.trinity.duke.edu/wp-content/themes/cgsh/materials/WKO/v2d2_Lugones.pdf|title=M. Lugones, coloniality of gender, 2008|author=|date=|website=duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;), coloniality of "being" (Maldonado Torres), coloniality of knowledge ([[Walter Mignolo]]) and [[Coloniality of power]] ([[Anibal Quijano]]).

==New developments==
New developments in world systems research include studies on the cyclical processes. More specifically, it refers to the cycle of leading industries or products (ones that are new and have an important share of the overall world market for commodities), which is equal to dissolution of quasi-monopolies or other forms of partial monopolies achieved by core nations. Such forms of partial monopolies are achievable through ownership of leading industries or products, which require technological capabilities, patents, restrictions on imports and/or exports, government subsidies, etc. Such capabilities are most often found in core nations, which accumulate capital through achieving such quasi-monopolies with leading industries or products.

As capital is accumulated, employment and wage also increase, creating a sense of prosperity. This leads to increased production, and sometimes even [[overproduction]], causing price competition to arise. To lower production costs, production processes of the leading industries or products are relocated to semi-peripheral nations. When competition increases and quasi-monopolies cease to exist, their owners, often core nations, move on to other new leading industries or products, and the cycle continues.&lt;ref name=IW-D /&gt;

Other new developments include the consequences of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the roles of [[gender]] and the culture, studies of [[slavery]] and incorporation of new regions into the world system and the precapitalist world systems.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Arguably, the greatest source of renewal in world-systems analysis since 2000 has been the synthesis of world-system and environmental approaches. Key figures in the "greening" of world-systems analysis include Minqi Li, Jason W. Moore, Andreas Malm, Stephen Bunker, Alf Hornborg, and Richard York.

===Time period===
Wallerstein traces the origin of today's world-system to the "long 16th century" (a period that began with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]] by Western European sailors and ended with the [[English Revolution]] of 1640).&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;  And, according to Wallerstein, globalization, or the becoming of the world's system, is a process coterminous with the spread and development of capitalism over the past 500 years.

[[Janet Abu Lughod]] argues that a pre-modern world system extensive across Eurasia existed in the 13th century prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by Wallerstein. [[Janet Abu Lughod]] contends that the [[Secret History of the Mongols|Mongol Empire]] played an important role in stitching together the Chinese, Indian, Muslim and European regions in the 13th century, before the rise of the modern world system.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lugod, Janet (1989), "Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350"&lt;/ref&gt; In debates, Wallerstein contends that Lughod's system was not a "world-system" because it did not entail integrated production networks, but it was instead a vast trading network.

[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|The 11th century world system]]

[[Andre Gunder Frank]] goes further and claims that a global world system that includes Asia, Europe and Africa has existed since the [[4th millennium BCE]]. The centre of this system was in Asia, specifically China.&lt;ref&gt;André Gunder Frank, Barry K. Gills, The world system: five hundred years or five thousand?, Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0-415-15089-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVAWQ1D8UJUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22world-system+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ALVRTLv1J5SssAa_15zoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world-system%20is%22&amp;f=false Google Print, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Korotayev]] goes even further than Frank and dates the beginning of the world system formation to the 10th millennium BCE and connects it with the start of the [[Neolithic Revolution]] in the Middle East. According to him, the centre of this system was originally in [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf Korotayev A.

===Current research===
Wallerstein's theories are widely recognized throughout the world. In the United States, one of the hubs of world-systems research is at the [[Fernand Braudel Center|Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilizations]], at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Among the most important related periodicals are the ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Section on the Political Economy of the World System (PEWS), and the ''[[Review, A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center|Review]]'', published the Braudel Center.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; 

Edythe E. Weeks asserts the proposition that it may be possible to consider, and apply critical insights, to prevent future patterns from emerging in ways to repeat outcomes harmful to humanity. (See ''Outer Space Development, Space Law and International Relations: A Method for Elucidating Seeds'' (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012)). Her current research, as a Fulbright Specialist, further suggests that new territories such as the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica, the Arctic and various regions of outer space, including low Earth orbit, the geostationary orbit, Near Earth orbit are currently in the process of colonization. By applying lessons learned from our past, we can change the future towards a direction less likely to be widely criticized.

Muhammed Asadi suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose superior economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the command states (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them. Militarized States have a life cycle in which destruction is almost inevitable and since their economic growth stabilizes the dominant economies it seldom translates into personal economic development &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/dissertations/447/|title=The Military, Economy and the State: A New International System Analysis|first=Asadi, Muhammed|last=A.|date=16 May 2018|journal=Dissertations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

'''World War&amp;nbsp;II''' (often abbreviated to '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), also known as the '''Second World War''', was a [[World war|global war]] that lasted from 1939 to 1945. [[World War II by country|The vast majority of the world's countries]]—including all the [[great power]]s—eventually formed two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. A state of [[total war]] emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]].

[[Empire of Japan|Japan]], which [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|aimed to dominate]] [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], was [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with China by 1937,{{sfn|Barrett|Shyu|2001|p=6}}{{efn|Although open hostilities existed between Japan and China from 1937, neither belligerent formally declared war on the other until after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.}} though neither side had [[declaration of war|declared war]] on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Alan (2007) ''Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1''. Infobase Publishing. pp. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaign]]s and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and Japan. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], into a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific Ocean. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.

The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South]] [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.

The war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]] by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by fiat by the Allies and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|the Japanese]].

World War&amp;nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power|great powers]]—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].&lt;ref name="The UN Security Council"&gt;{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival [[superpower|superpowers]], setting the stage for the nearly half-century long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From War to Peace: A European Tale|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-lecture_en.html|publisher=Nobel Lecture by the European Union|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council|author2=José Manuel Durão Barroso, President of the European Commission|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of the [[End of World War II in Asia|war's end]] is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the [[armistice]] of 14 August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal [[surrender of Japan]], which was on 2 September 1945 that officially [[End of World War II in Asia|ended the war in Asia]].

== Background ==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

=== Europe ===
[[World War I]] had radically altered the [[Geopolitics|political]] European map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]]—including [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]—and the 1917 [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], which eventually led to the founding of the [[Soviet Union]]. Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]

To prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.

Despite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&amp;pg=PA76 76–8]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}

[[File:Nürnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a "[[New Roman Empire]]".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}

[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}

The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards [[military globalization]]; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=298-299}}

=== Asia ===
The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party]] allies{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} and [[Central Plains War|new regional warlords]]. In 1931, an [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}

Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coogan|1993}}: "Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender. A few commanders submitted, receiving high office in the puppet government, but others took up arms against the invader. The forces they commanded were the first of the volunteer armies."&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]], the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.{{sfn|Busky|2002|p=10}}

{{Main|Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}
[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benito Mussolini]] inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]], 1935]]

The [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War]] was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Names of Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]) by the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), which was launched from [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC |title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia |author1=Andrea L.

Seybolt |page=308 |accessdate=6 April 2014|isbn=9781412981767 |date=5 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, [[Appeasement|but the League did little]] when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's [[Covenant of the League of Nations|Covenant]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–2}} The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but they were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=289}} Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Kitson|2001|p=231}}

=== Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) ===

When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Over 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the [[International Brigades]], also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War II but generally favoured the Axis.{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=271}} His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of [[Blue Division|volunteers]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Payne|2008|page=146}}

=== Japanese invasion of China (1937) ===
{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}
[[File:Shanghai1937IJA ruins.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese Imperial Army]] soldiers during the [[Battle of Shanghai]], 1937]]

In July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of [[Peking]] after instigating the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|pp=547–51}} The Soviets quickly signed a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact with China]] to lend [[materiel]] support, effectively ending China's prior [[Sino-German cooperation 1926–1941|co-operation with Germany]]. From September to November, the Japanese attacked [[Battle of Taiyuan|Taiyuan]], engaged the [[National Revolutionary Army|Kuomintang Army]] [[Battle of Xinkou|around Xinkou]],&lt;ref name="Hsu &amp; Chang 1971 221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=195–200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and fought [[Communist Party of China|Communist forces]] [[Battle of Pingxingguan|in Pingxingguan]].&lt;ref name=Tucker2009&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&amp;pg=PA1873|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East [6 volumes]: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|first=Spencer C.|last=Tucker|date=23 December 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=27 August 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781851096725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yang&gt;Yang Kuisong, "On the reconstruction of the facts of the Battle of Pingxingguan"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanking|capturing the capital Nanking]] in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were [[Nanking Massacre|murdered by the Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Mark and Roberts, Penny.

In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their [[Battle of Taierzhuang|first major victory at Taierzhuang]] but then the city of [[Xuzhou]] [[Battle of Xuzhou|was taken by Japanese]] in May.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=221–230}} In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [[1938 Yellow River flood|flooding the Yellow River]]; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at [[Wuhan]], but the [[Battle of Wuhan|city was taken]] by October.{{sfn|Eastman|1986|p=566}} Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to [[Chongqing]] and continued the war.{{sfn|Taylor|2009|pp=150–2}}{{sfn|Sella|1983|pp=651–87}}

=== Soviet–Japanese border conflicts ===
{{Main|Soviet–Japanese border conflicts}}
[[File:Battle of Lake Khasan-Red Army gunners in the interval.jpg|thumb|[[Red Army]] artillery unit during the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]], 1938]]

In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in [[Manchukuo]] had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]]. The Japanese doctrine of [[Hokushin-ron]], which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkin Gol]] in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=342}} and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of [[Nanshin-ron]], promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Goldman, Stuart D. |date=28 August 2012 |title=The Forgotten Soviet-Japanese War of 1939 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/the-forgotten-soviet-japanese-war-of-1939/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy Neeno |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War |publisher=MilitaryHistoryOnline.com |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/nomonhan.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], again provoking [[Appeasement of Hitler|little response]] from other European powers.{{sfn|Collier|Pedley|2000|p=144}} Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the [[Sudetenland]], an area of [[Czechoslovakia]] with a predominantly [[ethnic German]] population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the counsel of British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and conceded this territory to Germany in the [[Munich Agreement]], which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=121–2}} Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to [[First Vienna Award|cede additional territory]] to [[Hungary]], and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's [[Zaolzie]] region.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=157}}

Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939 [[Plan Z|secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy]] to challenge British naval supremacy.

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in [[Southeast Asia]], the two powers signed the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Garver|1988|p=114}} By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=195}}

Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-3.html 69]}} He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, [[German–Soviet Axis talks|negotiations took place]] to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.

=== War breaks out in the Pacific (1941) ===
{{Main|Pacific War}}

In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan, and beginning with an [[aviation gasoline]] ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.{{r|ibiblio_1940}} During this time, Japan launched its [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|first attack against Changsha]], a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September.{{sfn|Jowett|Andrew|2002|p=14}} Despite [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|several offensives]] by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940.

Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] in early 1940. In August, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communists]] launched an [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|offensive in Central China]]; in retaliation, Japan instituted [[Three Alls Policy|harsh measures]] in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.{{sfn|Joes|2004|p=224}} Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces [[New Fourth Army incident|culminated in armed clashes in January 1941]], effectively ending their co-operation.{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=320}} In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during [[Battle of Shanggao]].{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=30}} In September, Japan attempted to [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|take the city of Changsha]] again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.{{sfn|Hsu|Chang|1971|p=33}}

German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on European governments in [[Southeast Asia]]. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan some oil supplies from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Japanese Policy and Strategy 1931 – July 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=45–66 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=201}}{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|2012|p=456}} At the same time, Japan was [[Kantokuen|planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East]], intending to capitalise off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coox|first1=Alvin|title=Nomonhan: Japan against Russia, 1939|date=1985|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|pages=1046–1049|isbn=978-0-8047-1835-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.&lt;ref name=USAWWIIcp5&gt;{{cite web |title=The decision for War |website=US Army in WWII – Strategy and Command: The First Two Years |pp=113–27 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Strategy/Strategy-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.&lt;ref name=USAWWIIcp4&gt;{{cite web |title=The Showdown With Japan Aug–Dec 1941 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=63–96 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt reinforced [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946)]] and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".{{r|USAWWIIcp4}}

Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new government under [[Hideki Tojo]] presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.{{r|USAWWIIcp5}} The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/pha/congress/app-d.html#363 The United States Replies]. Investigation of the Pearl Harbor attack.&lt;/ref&gt; That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Painter|2012|p=26}}: "The United States cut off oil exports to Japan in the summer of 1941, forcing Japanese leaders to choose between going to war to seize the oil fields of the Netherlands East Indies or giving in to U.S. pressure."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|2007|p=9}}, listing various military and diplomatic developments, observes that "the threat to Japan was not purely economic."&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.{{sfn|Lightbody|2004|p=125}}

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dower|1986|p=5}}, calls attention to the fact that "the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure. Japan did not invade independent countries in southern Asia. It invaded colonial outposts which the Westerners had dominated for generations, taking absolutely for granted their racial and cultural superiority over their Asian subjects." Dower goes on to note that, before the horrors of Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many Asians responded favourably to the victories of the Imperial Japanese forces.&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.{{sfn|Wood|2007|pp=11–2}} On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous [[Japanese expansion (1941–1942)|offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific]].{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} These included an [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor]] and [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|landings in Thailand and Malaya]],{{sfn|Wohlstetter|1962|pp=341–3}} and the [[Battle of Hong Kong]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

These attacks led the [[United States declaration of war on Japan|United States]], [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Japan|United Kingdom]], China, Australia and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunn|1998|p=157}}. According to {{Harvnb|May|1955|p=155}}, Churchill stated: "Russian declaration of war on Japan would be greatly to our advantage, provided, but only provided, that Russians are confident that will not impair their Western Front."&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States|Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States]] in Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.{{r|Events1941}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Klooz |first1=Marle |last2=Wiley |first2=Evelyn |others=Director: Humphrey, Richard A. |year=1944 |title=Events leading up to World War II – Chronological History |series=78th Congress, 2d Session – House Document N. 541 |location=Washington |publisher=US Government Printing Office |at=p. 310 ([http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/1941.html 1941]) |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/events/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casablanca-Conference.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British PM [[Winston Churchill]] seated at the [[Casablanca Conference]], January 1943]]

On 1 January 1942, the [[Four Policemen|Allied Big Four]]{{sfn|Bosworth|Maiolo|2015|pp=313–314}}—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the [[Declaration by United Nations]], thereby affirming the [[Atlantic Charter]],{{sfn|Mingst|Karns|2007|p=22}} and agreeing to not to sign a [[separate peace]] with the Axis powers.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=904}}

During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate [[grand strategy]] to pursue. All agreed that [[Europe first|defeating Germany]] was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, [[Operation Sledgehammer|large-scale attack]] on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Full Dress Debate over Strategic Deployment.

At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration by the United Nations, and demanded the [[unconditional surrender]] of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Casablanca – Beginning of an Era: January 1943 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=18–42 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic2/USA-WD-Strategic2-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trident Conference – New Patterns: May 1943 |website=US Army in WWII – Strategic Planning for Coalition Warfare |pp=126–45 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic2/USA-WD-Strategic2-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered [[Japanese conquest of Burma|Burma]], [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]], [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and [[Rabaul]], inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|pp=247–267, 345}} Despite stubborn [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|resistance]] by Filipino and US forces, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.{{sfn|Lewis|1953|loc=p. 529 (Table 11)}} On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.{{sfn|Slim|1956|pp=71–4}} Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|South China Sea]], [[Battle of the Java Sea|Java Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean raid (1942)|Indian Ocean]],{{sfn|Grove|1995|p=362}} and [[Bombing of Darwin|bombed the Allied naval base]] at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|victory at Changsha]].{{sfn|Ch'i|1992|p=158}} These easy victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.{{sfn|Perez|1998|p=145}}

In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to [[Operation Mo|capture Port Moresby]] by [[amphibious assault]] and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].{{sfn|Maddox|1992|pp=111–2}} Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.{{sfn|Salecker|2001|p=186}} In mid-May, Japan started the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schoppa|2011|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lILltXBTo8oC&amp;pg=PA19 Chevrier &amp; Chomiczewski &amp; Garrigue 2004], p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive [[Battle of Midway|victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ropp|2000|p=368}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marines rest in the field on Guadalcanal.jpg|left|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific theatre]], 1942]]

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=339}} The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Adrian |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=978-1-59228-027-8 |p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].{{sfn|Swain|2001|p=197}} Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=31}} In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|Kerch Peninsula]] and at [[Second Battle of Kharkov|Kharkov]],{{sfn|Read|2004|p=764}} and then launched their main [[Case Blue|summer offensive]] against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the [[Baku Oil Fields|oil fields of the Caucasus]] and occupy [[Kuban]] [[steppe]], while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split [[Army Group South]] into two groups: [[Army Group A]] advanced to the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while [[Army Group B]] headed towards the [[Volga River]].

Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|1986}}; {{Harvnb|Glantz|1989|pp=149–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=592}} This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=32}}

On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own [[Operation Kutuzov|counter-offensives]], thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=595}} giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|O'Reilly|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Healy|1992|p=90}} The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified [[Panther–Wotan line]], but the Soviets broke through it at [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Smolensk]] and by the [[Lower Dnieper Offensive]]s.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|pp=50–5}}

On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]], following [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy's armistice with the Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1990|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=362}} and creating a series of defensive lines.{{sfn|Hart|Hart|Hughes|2000|p=151}} German special forces then [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued Mussolini]], who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the [[Italian Social Republic]],{{sfn|Blinkhorn|2006|p=52}} causing an [[Italian Civil War|Italian civil war]]. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the [[Winter Line|main German defensive line]] in mid-November.{{sfn|Read|Fisher|2002|p=129}}

German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By [[Black May (1943)|May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective]], the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Padfield|1998|pp=335–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1943, [[Franklin D.

From November 1943, during the seven-week [[Battle of Changde]], the Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied relief.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2012 268_274"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|pp=268–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H161&gt;{{Harvnb|Ch'i|1992|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu Chang 412-416"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hsu|Chang|1971|pp=412–416, Map 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1944, the Allies launched a [[Battle of Monte Cassino|series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino]] and tried to outflank it with [[Operation Shingle|landings at Anzio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|pp=660–1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 1944, [[Leningrad Front|Soviet]] troops launched [[Siege of Leningrad#Soviet relief of the siege|a major offensive]] that expelled German forces from the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]], thereby ending the longest and [[List of battles by casualties#Sieges and urban combat|most lethal siege in history]].&lt;ref name="Glantz 2002 327_366"&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2002|pp=327–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive|following Soviet offensive]] was [[Battle of Narva (1944)|halted on the pre-war Estonian border]] by the German [[Army Group North]] aided by [[Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany#Estonians in German Military Units in 1941–1944|Estonians]] hoping to [[Estonian government-in-exile#Failure to reestablish independence|re-establish national independence]].

The period featured massacres with victims in the hundreds at [[Civitella in Val di Chiana|Civitella]] ({{Harvnb|de Grazia|Paggi|1991}}; {{Harvnb|Belco|2010}}), [[Ardeatine massacre|Fosse Ardeatine]] ({{Harvnb|Portelli|2003}}), and [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre|Sant'Anna di Stazzema]] ({{Harvnb|Gordon|2012|pp=10–1}}), and is capped with the [[Marzabotto massacre]].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, [[Operation U-Go|an operation against British positions in Assam, India]],&lt;ref name="Lightbody 2004 224"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lightbody|2004|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]].&lt;ref name="Zeiler"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zeiler|2004|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma,&lt;ref name="Zeiler"/&gt; and Chinese forces that had [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|invaded northern Burma]] in late 1943 [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieged Japanese troops]] in [[Myitkyina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|pp=555–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Operation Ichi-Go|second Japanese invasion]] of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ch'i|1992|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of [[Henan]] and begun a [[Battle of Changsha (1944)|new attack on Changsha]] in the [[Hunan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coble|2003|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by [[Operation Market Garden|a major airborne operation]] in the Netherlands failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dear|Foot|2001|p=562}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but [[Operation Queen|failed to cross the Ruhr river]] in a large offensive.

On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus ("[[Operation Bagration]]") that destroyed the German [[Army Group Centre]] almost completely.&lt;ref name="Zaloga 1996 7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaloga|1996|p=7}}: "It was the most calamitous defeat of all the German armed forces in World War II."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive|another Soviet strategic offensive]] forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviet advance prompted [[Armia Krajowa|resistance forces in Poland]] to [[Operation Tempest|initiate several uprisings]] against the German occupation. However, the largest of these, [[Warsaw Uprising|in Warsaw]] and a [[Slovak National Uprising|national uprising]] in [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], did not receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berend|1996|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army's [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|strategic offensive in eastern Romania]] cut off and destroyed the [[Army Group South Ukraine|considerable German troops there]] and triggered [[King Michael's Coup|a successful coup d'état in Romania]] and [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|in Bulgaria]], followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/23.htm|title=Armistice Negotiations and Soviet Occupation|publisher=US Library of Congress|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=The coup speeded the Red Army's advance, and the Soviet Union later awarded Michael the Order of Victory for his personal courage in overthrowing Antonescu and putting an end to Romania's war against the Allies.

In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups [[Army Group E|E]] and [[Army Group F|F]] in [[Axis occupation of Greece|Greece]], [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–44)|Albania]] and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.&lt;ref name="Evans 2008 653"&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2008|p=653}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, the Communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] under Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], who had led an [[World War II in Yugoslavia|increasingly successful guerrilla campaign]] against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern [[Serbia (1941–1944)|Serbia]], the [[Red Army]], with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of the capital city of Belgrade]] on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a [[Budapest Offensive|massive assault]] against [[Operation Panzerfaust|German-occupied]] Hungary that lasted until [[Battle of Budapest|the fall of Budapest]] in February 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiest|Barbier|2002|pp=65–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, [[Continuation War|bitter Finnish resistance]] to the [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive|Soviet offensive]] in the [[Karelian Isthmus]] denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a [[Moscow Armistice|Soviet-Finnish armistice]] on relatively mild conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wiktor|first=Christian L|title=Multilateral Treaty Calendar – 1648–1995|publisher=Kluwer Law International|year=1998|isbn=978-90-411-0584-4|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Finland was forced to [[Lapland War|fight their former allies]].{{sfn|Schire|1990|p=1085}}

In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands]], and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, [[Hideki Tojo]], and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces [[Battle of Leyte|invaded the Filipino island of Leyte]]; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], one of the largest naval battles in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|Bewes|1997|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axis collapse, Allied victory (1944–45) ===
On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch [[Battle of the Bulge|a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes]] and [[Operation Nordwind|along the French–German border]] to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at [[Antwerp]] to prompt a political settlement.&lt;ref name="parkerxiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|2004|pp=xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70, 329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.&lt;ref name="parkerxiii"/&gt; In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line.

The key military factor causing this effect was the sea blockade, which crippled Japan's ability to produce and equip the forces necessary to execute its strategy. The most important factor accounting for the timing of surrender  was the Soviet attack against Manchuria, largely because it persuaded previously adamant Army leaders that the homeland could not be defended.".&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army also captured the southern part of [[Sakhalin]] Island and the [[Kuril Islands]]. On 15 August 1945, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]], with the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender documents]] finally signed at [[Tokyo Bay]] on the deck of the American battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] on 2 September 1945, ending the war.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2012 776"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beevor|2012|p=776}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies established occupation administrations in [[Allied-occupied Austria|Austria]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]]. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. A [[denazification]] programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the [[Nuremberg trials]] and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.&lt;ref name="Frei 2002 41_66"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frei|2002|pp=41–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to maintain [[world peace]],&lt;ref name="Yoder 1997 39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoder|1997|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Allies formed the [[United Nations]], which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |title=History of the UN |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=25 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as a common standard for all [[Member states of the United Nations|member nations]].&lt;ref name="Waltz 2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waltz|2002}}.&lt;br&gt;
The UDHR is viewable here [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/].&lt;/ref&gt; The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the UN's [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].&lt;ref name="The UN Security Council"/&gt; The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|between]] the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its [[successor state]], the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Post-war border changes in [[Central Europe]] and creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]]]]

Germany had been ''de facto'' divided, and two independent states, the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]],&lt;ref name="Wettig 2008 96_100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were created within the borders of [[Bizone|Allied]] and [[Soviet occupation zone]]s.

As a result, [[East Germany]],&lt;ref name="Applebaum 2012"&gt;{{Harvnb|Applebaum|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]]&lt;ref name="Naimark 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Naimark|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became Soviet [[satellite state]]s.

Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led [[NATO]] and the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="Borstelmann 2005 318"&gt;{{Harvnb|Borstelmann|2005|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the [[Cold War]], would be accompanied by an unprecedented [[arms race]] and [[proxy war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leffler|Westad|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, the United States led the [[occupation of Japan]] and [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|administrated Japan's former islands]] in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]].&lt;ref name="Weinberg 2005 911"&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|2005|p=911}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korea]], formerly [[Korea under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]], was [[Division of Korea|divided and occupied]] by the Soviet Union in the [[North Korea|North]] and the United States in the [[South Korea|South]] between 1945 and 1948.

In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed [[Chinese Civil War|the civil war]] in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Lynch 2010 12_13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lynch|2010|pp=12–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and the [[creation of Israel]] marked the escalation of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their [[colonial empire]]s, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to [[Decolonization|decolonisation]].&lt;ref name="JMRoberts 1996 589"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1997|p=589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|2007|pp=441–3, 464–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a [[Post–World War II baby boom|baby boom]], and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dear|Foot|2001|p=1006}}; {{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|pp=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and US pursued a policy of [[Allied plans for German industry after World War II|industrial disarmament in Western Germany]] in the years 1945–1948.&lt;ref name = "Balabkins 1964 207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|p=207}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Petrov|1967|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Balabkins 1964 208,209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balabkins|1964|pp=208, 209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates.

At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the [[East Asia Development Board]], or ''Kōain'', for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million.&lt;ref name="zhifen2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ju|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/sino-japanese/session6.htm|first=Zhifen|title=Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draughtees after the outbreak of the Pacific war|work=Joint Study of the Sino-Japanese War:Minutes of the June 2002 Conference|publisher=Harvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences|date=June 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521093637/http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/sino-japanese/session6.htm|archivedate=21 May 2012|accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Java]], between 4 and 10 million ''[[rōmusha]]'' (Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military.

[[File:Palmiry before execution.jpg|thumb|right|Polish civilians wearing blindfolds photographed just before [[Palmiry massacre|their execution by German soldiers in Palmiry forest]], 1940]]

In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizeable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Liberman|1996|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went on.&lt;ref name="Milward 1979 138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen retouched.jpg|thumb|left|[[Soviet partisans]] hung executed by the German army. The [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] reported in 1995 [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|civilian victims in the Soviet Union]] at German hands totalled 13.7 million dead, twenty percent of the 68 million persons in the occupied Soviet Union.]]

In the East, the intended gains of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet [[scorched earth]] policies denied resources to the German invaders.&lt;ref name="Milward 1992 148"&gt;{{Harvnb|Milward|1992|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the West, the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policy]] encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "[[Untermensch|inferior people]]" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by [[Generalplan Ost|mass executions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|Harrison|2006|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Resistance during World War II|resistance groups]] formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2005|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the West&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Christofferson|Christofferson|2006|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; until late 1943.

In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], essentially a Japanese [[hegemony]] which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radtke|1997|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks.&lt;ref name="GSWW6_266" /&gt; During Japan's initial conquest it captured {{convert|4000000|oilbbl}} of oil (~5.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to {{bbl to t|50|mlt=M}}, 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate.&lt;ref name="GSWW6_266"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rahn|2001|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home fronts and production ===
{{Main|Military production during World War II|Home front during World War II}}
[[File:WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis-simple.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Allied to Axis GDP ratio]]

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.&lt;ref name="6Econ3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.&lt;ref name="6Econ3"/&gt;

The United States provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Wilson, ''Destructive Creation: American Business and the Winning of World War II'' (2016) p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].&lt;ref name="6Econ2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harrison|1998|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the [[labour force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|1991|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffith|first=Charles|title=The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II|isbn=978-1-58566-069-8|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1999|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany's late shift to a [[war economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overy|1994|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|BBSU|1998|p=84}}; {{Harvnb|Lindberg|Todd|2001|p=126}}..&lt;/ref&gt; To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Unidas|first=Naciones|title=World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration|page=23|publisher=United Nations Pubns|year=2005|isbn=978-92-1-109147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Germany used]] about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="compensation"/&gt; while [[Slavery in Japan|Japan used]] more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.&lt;ref name="zhifen2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indonesiaww2"/&gt;

=== Advances in technology and warfare ===
{{Main|Technology during World War II}}
[[File:Boeing-Whichata B-29 Assembly Line - 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] [[strategic bombers]] on the [[Boeing]] assembly line in [[Wichita, Kansas]], 1944]]

Aircraft were used for [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]], as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s, and [[close air support|ground-support]], and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);&lt;ref name="EncWWII_76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levine|1992|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Klavans|Di Benedetto|Prudom|1997}}; {{Harvnb|Ward|2010|pp=247–51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Missile|guided missiles]] were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably [[Surface-to-air missile|target aircraft]] until some years after the war.

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of [[naval warfare]], most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, [[Battle of Taranto|actions at Taranto]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=978-1-84509-079-1|location=Wigston, Leics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

The British focused development on [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[anti-submarine weapon|weaponry]] and tactics, such as [[sonar]] and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII submarine]] and [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] tactics.&lt;ref name="Bur&amp;Ryd 1995 16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burcher|Rydill|1995|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the [[Leigh light]], [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]], [[Squid (weapon)|squid]], and [[Mark 24 mine|homing torpedoes]] proved victorious.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Land warfare]] changed from the static front lines of [[trench warfare]] of World War&amp;nbsp;I, which had relied on improved [[artillery]] that outmatched the speed of both [[infantry]] and [[cavalry]], to increased mobility and [[combined arms]]. The [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=978-0-7106-0123-0|year=1982|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] with increases in speed, armour and firepower.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_125"/&gt; Many means of [[anti-tank warfare|destroying tanks]], including [[Indirect fire|indirect artillery]], [[anti-tank gun]]s (both towed and [[self-propelled gun|self-propelled]]), [[anti-tank mine|mines]], short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.&lt;ref name="EncWWII_108" /&gt; Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,&lt;ref name="EncWWII_734"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2004|p=734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref name="Comp_221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowley|Parker|2001|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German [[MG34]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were suited to [[close combat]] in urban and jungle settings.&lt;ref name="Comp_221" /&gt; The [[assault rifle]], a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine |publisher=controlarms.org |first=Oliver |last=Sprague |first2=Hugh |last2=Griffiths |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/011/2006/en/ |accessdate=14 November 2009 |year=2006 |format=PDF |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large [[codebook]]s for [[cryptography]] by designing [[cipher]]ing machines, the most well known being the German [[Enigma machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ratcliff|2006|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of [[SIGINT]] (''sig''nals ''int''elligence) and [[cryptanalysis]] enabled the countering process of decryption.

'''World energy consumption''' is the total [[energy]] used by the entire human [[civilization]]. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every [[energy development|energy source]] applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. It does not include energy from food, and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented.  Being the power source metric of civilization, World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere.

Institutions such as the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), and the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) record and publish energy data periodically. Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns, which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions.

Closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total [[primary energy]] supply (TPES), which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes. Since changes of energy storage over the year are minor, TPES values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption. However, TPES ignores conversion efficiency, overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (e.g. [[coal]], gas and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (e.g. [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic]] or [[hydroelectricity]]). The IEA estimates that, in 2013, total primary energy supply (TPES) was 1.575 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Watt hour|Wh]] (= 157.5 PWh, 157,500 TWh, 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s, or 13,541 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) or about 18 TW-year.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title= IEA - Key world energy statistics, 2015 |url=ftp://ftp.energia.bme.hu/pub/energetikai_alapismeretek/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydropower and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, in part due to nuclear disasters (e.g. [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] 1979, [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] 1986, and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] 2011).&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="undp"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf World Energy Assessment] (WEA). UNDP, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, World Energy Council, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion USD, or about 10% of the world [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Europe spends close to one-quarter of the world's energy expenditures, North America close to 20%, and Japan 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Desbrosses, [http://www.leonardo-energy.org/blog/world-energy-expenditures World Energy Expenditures], Leonardo Energy, Nov. 28 2011 (accessed 30 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

World [[primary energy|total primary energy supply]] (TPES), or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers. For instance, when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline, so that it can be used in a car, and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers. World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity.

Also, one needs to bear in mind that there are different [[Energy quality|qualities of energy]]. Heat, especially at a relatively low temperature, is low-quality energy, whereas electricity is high-quality energy. It takes around 3&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity. But by the same token, a kilowatt-hour of this high-quality electricity can be used to pump several kilowatt-hours of heat into a building using a heat pump. And electricity can be used in many ways in which heat cannot. So the "loss" of energy incurred when generating electricity is not the same as a loss due, say, to resistance in power lines

In 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,541&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]], while the world final energy consumption was 109,613&amp;nbsp;TWh or about 29.5% less than the total supply.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2016"/&gt; World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use amounted to 
9,723 TWh (836 Mtoe) in 2015.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2017"/&gt;

The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources. For 2013, estimated world energy consumption was 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules, or 157,481&amp;nbsp;TWh. According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] the total world energy consumption in past years was 143,851 TWh in 2008, 133,602&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, 117,687&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000, and 102,569&amp;nbsp;TWh in 1990.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015" /&gt; In 2012 approximately 22% of world energy was consumed in North America, 5% was consumed South and Central America, 23% was consumed in Europe and Eurasia, 3% was consumed in Africa, and 40% was consumed in the Asia Pacific region.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

===Electricity generation===
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2013, 16,503&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2008, 15,105&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, and 12,116&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000. 
By the end of 2014, the total installed electricity generating capacity worldwide was nearly 6.142 [[Terawatt|TW]] (million MW) which only includes generation connected to local [[electricity grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Electricity - Installed generating capacity, 2014 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2236.html#xx|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition there is an unknown amount of heat and electricity consumed off-grid by isolated villages and industries. 
In 2014, the share of world energy consumption for electricity generation by source was coal at 40.8%, natural gas at 21.6%, nuclear at 10.6%, hydro at 16.4%, other sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) at 6.3% and oil at 4.3%. 
Coal and natural gas were the most used energy fuels for generating electricity. 
The world's electricity consumption was 18,608&amp;nbsp;TWh {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} in 2012. 
This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants ([[gross generation]]). 
[[Cogeneration]] (CHP) power stations use some of the heat that is otherwise wasted for use in buildings or in industrial processes.

In 2016 while total world energy came from 80% fossil fuels, 10% biofuels, 5% nuclear and 5% renewable (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal), only 18% of that total world energy was in the form of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/d62f12b8fe88e85dc3349c38b1ca5e44cc22c5ccc6f70beed634020cfb527c82/shell-world-energy-model.pdf pg4&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other 82% was used for heat and transportation.

Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Global energy: perspectives"&gt;{{cite book |last= Nakićenović |first= Nebojša |last2= Grübler|first2= Arnulf |last3= McDonald|first3= Alan | date= 1998 |title= Global energy: perspectives |location= Cambridge, New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0521642000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt; From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth. For several years now, the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets, while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies, high oil prices, resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/energy-press-releases/sluggish-growth-world-energy-demand-in-2011.php|title=Sluggish growth of World energy demand in 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the EU-27 block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.

In 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours ([[TWh]]) or 474 exajoules ([[exajoules|EJ]]).&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |work= Statistical Review of World Energy 2009 |publisher= [[BP]] |url= http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |title= Consumption by fuel, 1965–2008 |format= XLS |date= 8 June 2009 |accessdate= 24 October 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130726202544/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |archivedate= 26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 TWh (567&amp;nbsp;EJ).&lt;ref name=EIAIES2015&gt;{{cite web |title= International Energy Statistics|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption in the [[Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors|G20]] increased by more than 5% in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. In 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1%, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent ([[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]), as a result of the financial and economic crisis, which reduced world GDP by 0.6% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php|title=World Energy Statistics – Energy Supply &amp; Demand |publisher= Enerdata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (+4%). Conversely, in OECD, consumption was severely cut by 4.7% in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels. In North America, Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], consumptions shrank by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5% respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity. China became the world's largest energy consumer (18% of the total) since its consumption surged by 8% during 2009 (up from 4% in 2008). Oil remained the largest energy source (33%) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time. Coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009, it accounted for 27% of the total.

Most energy is used in the country of origin, since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials. In 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50% (1,952/3,941&amp;nbsp;Mt), gas 25% (800/3,149&amp;nbsp;bcm) and hard coal 14% (793/5,845&amp;nbsp;Mt).&lt;ref name=IEA20109&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] and [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key_stats_2009.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2009] oil page 11, gas p.13, hard coal (excluding brown coal) p. 15 and electricity p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter ''(see [[solar constant]])'', though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of [[Solar energy#Energy from the Sun|solar energy]] received by the planet; about half, 89,000&amp;nbsp;TW, reaches the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= William |last= Schreiber |url= http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/196/schreiber.html |title= Solving the Energy Problem |work= MIT Faculty Newsletter |date=May–June 2007 |accessdate= 2016-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4&amp;nbsp; yottajoule ([[Yottajoule|YJ]]) or 4 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules, and the available nuclear fuel such as [[uranium]] exceeding 2.5&amp;nbsp;YJ. Fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3&amp;nbsp;YJ if estimates of reserves of [[methane clathrates]] are accurate and become technically extractable. The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 5.5&amp;nbsp;YJ per year, though not all of this is available for human consumption. The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of $48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks."&lt;ref name="IEAreport"&gt;{{cite news |title= IEA estimates $48tn investments till 2035 to meet global energy demands |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-03/energy-supply-requires-40-trillion-investment-to-2035-iea-says.html |accessdate= 4 June 2014 |publisher= [[Bloomberg News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IEA (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2&amp;nbsp;°C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If action is not taken before 2017, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. Fossil fuels are dominant in the global [[energy mix]], supported by $523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30% on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf IEA World Energy Outlook 2012 Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emissions ===
[[Global warming]] [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] resulting from energy production are an [[environmental problem]]. Efforts to resolve this include the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (1997) and the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015), international governmental agreements aiming to [[Climate change mitigation|reduce harmful climate impacts]], which a number of nations have signed. Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, thought to be a risk by the [[Stockholm Environmental Institute|SEI]], is now doubtful.

To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in [[carbon emissions]] in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Energiläget 2050 by prof. Cristian Azar and Kristian Lindgren [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers]] [[Göteborg]] {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to [[Robert Engelman]] (Worldwatch institute), in order to prevent collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).&lt;ref&gt;''State of the world 2009'', [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse gases]] are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption. Large amounts of pollutants such as [[sulphurous oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[particulate matter]] (PM) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] [[combustion]] is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing air pollution like [[fossil fuel]] combustion, most biomass has high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PFPI-biomass-carbon-accounting-overview_April.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil fuels ===
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

The twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels. Between 1980 and 2006, the worldwide annual growth rate was 2%.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; According to the US [[Energy Information Administration]]'s 2006 estimate, the estimated 471.8&amp;nbsp;EJ total consumption in 2004, was divided as given in the table above, with fossil fuels supplying 86% of the world's energy:

====Coal====
{{Main article|Coal|List of countries by coal production}}

In 2000, China accounted for 28% of world coal consumption, other Asia consumed 19%, North America 25% and the EU 14%. The single greatest coal-consuming country is China. Its share of the world coal production was 28% in 2000 and rose to 48% in 2009. In contrast to China's ~70% increase in coal consumption, world coal use increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia.&lt;ref name="energisve2010Coal"/&gt; China's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector, the majority of which comes from coal consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Damien. "China's Coming Decade of Natural Gas". ''Asia's Uncertain LNG Future, NBR Special Report''. November 2013. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World annual coal production increased 1,905&amp;nbsp;Mt or 32% in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70% was in China and 8% in India. Coal production was in 2011 7,783&amp;nbsp;Mt, and 2009 6,903&amp;nbsp;Mt, equal to 12.7% production increase in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012, 2010 and 2006 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in the world. According to [[James Hansen]] the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from [[Coal mining|coal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf The True Cost of Coal] 27 November 2008 pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Energy in Australia|Australia]] exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oil ====
{{Main article|Petroleum|List of countries by oil production|List of countries by oil consumption}}

Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity, [[Petroleum|oil]] became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]], during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.&lt;ref name = "IEAKey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= International Energy Agency |title= Key World Energy Statistics |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }} pp. 48–57&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers needed on book sources --&gt;

It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090507072830.htm How Much Oil Have We Used?], [[Science Daily]], 8 May 2009. Retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural Gas ====
{{Main article|Natural Gas|List of countries by natural gas production|List of countries by natural gas consumption}}

In 2009, the world use of natural gas grew 31% compared to 2000. 66% of this growth was outside EU, North America, Latin America, and Russia. Others include the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The gas supply increased also in the previous regions: 8.6% in the EU and 16% in the North America 2000–2009.&lt;ref name="energiläget2010G"/&gt;

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title= Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author= [[REN21]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate= 4 September 2014 |year= 2014 |pages= 13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] is resulting in significant [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]], [[climate change mitigation]], and economic benefits.&lt;ref name="International Energy Agency 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ETP2012SUM.pdf |title= Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 |author= International Energy Agency |year= 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries |url= http://www.unep.org/pdf/72_Glob_Sust_Energy_Inv_Report_(2007).pdf |website= www.unep.org |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate= 13 October 2014 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6TIFLZQC2?url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/72_Glob_Sust_Energy_Inv_Report_(2007).pdf |archivedate= 13 October 2014 |page= 3 |format= PDF |year= 2007 |deadurl= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply.

==== Hydro ====
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower}}

Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with {{convert|721|TWh|PJ|abbr=on|order=flip}} of production in 2010, representing around 17% of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10&amp;nbsp;GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] in Brazil, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title= Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |publisher= Worldwatch Institute |date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|worlds top 10 renewable electricity producers]] are primarily hydroelectric, one is wind.

==== Marine energy ====
{{Main article|Ocean energy}}
[[Marine energy]], also known as ''ocean energy'' and ''marine and hydrokinetic energy'' (MHK) includes [[tidal power|tidal]] and [[wave power|wave]] power and is a relatively new sector of renewable energy, with most projects still in the pilot phase, but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4–18 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe). MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream [[turbine]]s in fast-moving [[river]]s, ocean current turbines in areas of strong [[marine current]]s, and [[ocean thermal energy converter]]s in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tethys |url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Solar ====
{{Main article|Solar energy|Solar power|Solar power by country}}

Solar energy, radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], has been harnessed by humans since [[ancient history|ancient times]] using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar architecture]], which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. The [[International Energy Agency]] projected that solar power could provide "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be reduced to very low levels."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s and [[solar thermal collector]]s to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. From 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3% of global energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geothermal ====
{{Main article|Geothermal energy|Geothermal power}}

[[Geothermal energy]] is used commercially in over 70 countries.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[MIT]] |title= The Future of Geothermal Energy |url= http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 7 February 2007 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110310030646/http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |archive-date= 10 March 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, {{convert|200|PJ|TWh}} of electricity was generated from geothermal resources, and an additional {{convert|270|PJ|TWh}} of geothermal energy was used directly, mostly for space heating. In 2007, the world had a global capacity for {{val|10|u=GW}} of electricity generation and an additional {{val|28|u=GW}} of [[geothermal heating|direct heating]], including extraction by [[geothermal heat pumps]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century |title= Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |archivedate= 18 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Ingvar B. |last1= Fridleifsson, |first2= Ruggero |last2= Bertani |first3= Ernst |last3= Huenges |first4= John W. |last4= Lund |first5= Arni |last5= Ragnarsson |first6= Ladislaus |last6= Rybach |date= 11 February 2008 |title= The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change |conference= IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources |editor= O.

==== Bio energy ====
{{Main article|Biomass|Biogas|Biofuel}}

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from [[biomass]] sources was estimated at 44&amp;nbsp;GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220&amp;nbsp;GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264&amp;nbsp;GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; World production of [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] increased by 8% in 2005 to reach {{convert|33|GL|usgal|lk=on}}, with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; [[Biodiesel]] increased by 85% to {{convert|3.9|GL|usgal}}, making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt;

[[File:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|World energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]]

Energy consumption is loosely correlated with [[Gross National Product#Gross National Product|gross national product]] and climate, but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries, such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6&amp;nbsp;kW per person and the [[Energy use in the United States|United States]] with an energy consumption rate of 11.4&amp;nbsp;kW per person. In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7&amp;nbsp;kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

The US consumes 25% of the world's energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.59%.&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://esa.un.org/UNPP/ |title= World Population Prospects |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= 7 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |archive-date= 21 March 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (19.6% of the world population&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects" /&gt;) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

One measurement of efficiency is [[energy intensity]]. This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product.

The table to the right shows the amounts of energy consumed worldwide in 2012 by four sectors, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[US Department of Energy]]:
*Residential (heating, lighting, and appliances)
*Commercial (lighting, heating and cooling of commercial buildings, and provision of water and sewer services)
*Industrial users (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction)
*Transportation (passenger, freight, and pipeline)
Of the total 120 PWh ({{val|120e15|ul=Wh}}) consumed, 19.4 were in the form of electricity, but this electricity required 61.7 PWh to produce. Thus the total energy consumption was around 160 PWh (ca {{val|550e15|ul=Btu}}).&lt;ref name=EIA2016/&gt; The efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy efficiency measures and technological improvements. |url= http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |publisher= e8.org |accessdate= 21 January 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204112155/http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |archivedate= 4 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }} Article by group of ten leading electricity companies&lt;/ref&gt; The new generation of gas-fired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55%.

Another report gives different values for the sectors, apparently due to different definitions. According to this, total world energy use per sector in 2008 was industry 28%, transport 27% and residential and service 36%. Division was about the same in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="energisve2010xS"/&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Environmental Agency]] (EEA) measures final energy consumption (does not include energy used in production and lost in transportation) and finds that the transport sector is responsible for 31.8% of final energy consumption, households 26.2%, industry 25.6%, [[service (economics)|services]] 13.5% and agriculture 2.9% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;European Environmental Agency. {{Cite web|url = http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/final-energy-consumption-by-sector-8/assessment-2|title = Final energy consumption by sector and fuel (CSI 027/ENER 016) - Assessment published Jan 2015|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }} Retrieved 21 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of energy is responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (79%), with the energy sector representing 31%, transport 19%, industry 13%, households 9% and others 7%.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hoos [[European Commission]] 2011. [http://eme2.eu/cust/documentrequest.aspx?DocID=148 A new Directive on Energy Efficiency]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[efficient energy use]] and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of [[coal plants]] in the [[European Union]] are more than 20 years old and operate at an efficiency level of between 32–40%.&lt;ref name=EC1&gt;[[European Commission]] 2011.
