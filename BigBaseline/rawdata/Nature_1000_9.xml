[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's [[strange attractor]] for values ρ=28, σ = 10, β = 8/3. The butterfly effect or sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the property of a [[dynamical system]] that, starting from any of various arbitrarily close alternative [[initial condition]]s on the attractor, the [[iteration#mathematics|iterated points]] will become arbitrarily spread out from each other.]]

[[File:Double pendulum simultaneous realisations.ogv|thumb|200px|right|Experimental demonstration of the butterfly effect with different recordings of the same double pendulum. In each recording, the pendulum starts with almost the same initial condition. Over time the differences in the dynamics grow from almost unnoticeable to drastic ones.]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123841/http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:dnf&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lorenz gave a name to the phenomenon, the idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer [[Henri Poincaré]] and American mathematician and philosopher [[Norbert Wiener]]. [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]]'s work placed the concept of ''instability'' of the earth's [[atmosphere]] onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butterfly effect - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102214427/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems.

==History==
In ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234031/http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"/&gt;

The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | title = The Physics of Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2012-06-15 | accessdate = 2015-09-02 | first = Faye | last = Flam | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130717/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz wrote:
{{blockquote|
"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution." (E. N. Lorenz, ''The Essence of Chaos'', U. Washington Press, Seattle (1993), page 134)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos at fifty|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003926/http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|archivedate=2016-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&amp;author=E.+N.+Lorenz&amp;publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]&lt;/ref&gt; (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061640/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963" /&gt; Elsewhere he stated:{{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Edward N. |last2= |first2= |date=1963 |title=The Predictability of Hydrodynamic Flow |url=http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_hydrodynamic_flow_1963.pdf |journal=Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=409–432 |doi= |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010161512/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_hydrodynamic_flow_1963.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Following suggestions from colleagues, in later speeches and papers Lorenz used the more poetic [[butterfly]]. According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350–362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[initial condition]] parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. For rational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are irrational, and, for irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; folded within the range&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==In physical systems==

===In weather===

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In quantum mechanics===

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]].

==In popular culture==
{{main|Butterfly effect in popular culture}}

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dizikes |first1=Petyer |title=The meaning of the butterfly |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |accessdate=8 June 2016 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=8 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418154015/http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Hazards''' are physical phenomena that expose a coastal area to risk of property damage, loss of life and environmental degradation. Rapid-onset hazards last over periods of minutes to several days and examples include major cyclones accompanied by high winds, waves and surges or tsunamis created by [[submarine earthquake]]s and landslides. Slow-onset hazards develop incrementally over longer time periods and examples include erosion and gradual inundation.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2005) Encyclopaedia of Coastal Science, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since early civilisation, coastal areas have been attractive settling grounds for human population as they provided abundant marine resources, fertile agricultural land and possibilities for trade and transport. This has led to high population densities and high levels of development in many coastal areas and this trend is continuing into the 21st century. At present, about 1,2 billion people live in coastal areas globally, and this number is  predicted to increase to 1,8–5,2 billion by the 2080s due to a combination of population growth and coastal migration.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this increase follows major investments in infrastructure and the build environment.

The characteristics of coastal environments, however, pose some great challenges to human habitation. Coastlines are highly dynamic natural systems that interact with terrestrial, marine and atmospheric processes and undergo continuous change in response to these processes. Over the years, human society has often failed to recognize the hazards related to these dynamics &lt;ref&gt;Masselink &amp; Hughes, Coastal processes &amp; geomorphology, Arnold, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and this has led to major disasters and societal disruption to various degrees. Even today, coastal development is often taking place with little regard to the hazards present in these environments, although climate change is likely to increase the general hazard levels.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2014: http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/&lt;/ref&gt; Societal activities in coastal areas can also pose a hazard to the natural balance of coastal systems, thereby disrupting e.g. sensitive ecosystems and subsequently human livelihood.

Coastal hazard management has become an increasingly important aspect of coastal planning in order to improve the resilience of society to coastal hazards. Possible management options include hard engineering structures, soft protection measures, various accommodation approaches as well as a managed retreat from the coastline. For addressing coastal hazards, it is also important to have early warning systems and emergency management plans in place to be able to address sudden and potential disastrous hazards i.e. major flooding events. Events as the Hurricane Katrina affecting the southern USA in 2005 and the cyclone Nargis affecting Myanmar in 2008 provides clear examples of the importance of timely coastal hazard management.

== Coastal environments of the USA ==
There are many different types of environments along the coasts of the United States with very diverse features that affect, influence, and mold the near-shore processes that are involved.  Understanding these ecosystems and environments can further advance the mitigating techniques and policy-making efforts against natural and man-made coastal hazards in these vulnerable areas.  The five most common types of [[coastal zone]]s range from the northern ice-pushing, mountainous coastline of Alaska and Maine, the barrier island coasts facing the Atlantic, the steep, cliff-back [[Headlands and bays|headlands]] along the pacific coast, the marginal-sea type coastline of the Gulf region, and the coral reef coasts bordering Southern Florida and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, Douglas L. "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE IN THE COASTAL ZONE." Environmental Science in the Coastal Zone: Issues for Further Research. The National Academic Press. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice-pushing/mountainous coastline'''

These coastal regions along the northernmost part of the nation were affected predominantly by, along with the rest of the Pacific Coast, continuous tectonic activity, forming a very long, irregular, ridged, steep and mostly mountainous coastline.  These environments are heavily occupied with permafrost and glaciers, which are the two major conditions affecting Alaska's Coastal Development.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrier island coastline'''

[[Barrier island]]s are a land form system that consists of fairly narrow strips of sand running parallel to the mainland and play a significant role in mitigating storm surges and oceans swells as natural storm events occur. The morphology of the various types and sizes of barrier islands depend on the wave energy, tidal range, basement controls, and sea level trends.  The islands create multiple unique environments of wetland systems including marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;"BarrierIslnd." Smithsonian Marine Station (SMS) at Fort Pierce. Web. 30 April 2012. &lt;http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/BarrierIslnd.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steep, cliff-backing abrasion coastline'''

The coastline along the western part of the nation consists of very steep, cliffed rock formations generally with vegetative slopes descending down and a fringing beach below.  The various sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rock formations assembled along a tectonically disturbed environment, all with altering resistances running perpendicular, cause the ridged, extensive stretch of uplifted cliffs that form the peninsulas, lagoons, and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, B., and N. Sitar. "Processes of Coastal Bluff Erosion in Weakly Lithified Sands, Pacifica, California, USA." Geomorphology 97.3–4 (2008): 483–501. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal-sea type coastline'''

The southern banks of the United States border the Gulf of Mexico, intersecting numerous rivers, forming many inlets bays, and lagoons along its coast, consisting of vast areas of marsh and wetlands.  This region of landform is prone to natural disasters yet highly and continuously developed, with man-made structures attaining to water flow and control.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coral reef coastline'''

[[Coral reef]]s are located off the shores of the southern Florida and Hawaii consisting of rough and complex natural structures along the bottom of the ocean floor with extremely diverse ecosystems, absorbing up to ninety percent of the energy dissipated from wind-generated waves.  This process is a significant buffer for the inner-lying coastlines, naturally protecting and minimizing the impact of storm surge and direct wave damage.  Because of the highly diverse ecosystems, these coral reefs not only provide for the shoreline protection, but also deliver an abundant amount of services to fisheries and  tourism, increasing its economic value.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, John. "Coral Reefs". Nature 40.1030 (1889): 294. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Coastal Hazards ==

[[File:Hurricane Flooding.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Surge]]

'''Natural VS Human disasters'''

The population that lives along or near our coastlines are an extremely vulnerable population.  There are numerous issues facing our coastlines and there are two main categories that these hazards can be placed under, [[Natural disasters]] and Human disasters.  Both of these issues cause great damage to our coastlines and discussion is still ongoing regarding what standards or responses need to be met to help both the individuals who want to continue living along the coastline, while keeping them safe and not eroding more coastline away.  Natural disasters are disasters that are out of human control and are usually caused by the weather.  Disasters that include but are not limited to; [[storms]], [[tsunamis]], [[typhoons]], [[flooding]], [[tides]], [[waterspouts]], [[nor'easters]], and [[storm surge]].  Human disasters occur when humans are the main culprit behind why the disaster happened.  Some human disasters are but are not limited to; [[pollution]], [[trawling]], and human development. Natural and human disasters continue to harm the coastlines severely and they need to be researched in order to prepare/stop the hazards if possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Coastal hazards- natural," 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations that live near or along the coast experience many hazards and it affects millions of people.  Around ten million people globally feel the effects of coastal problems yearly and most are due to certain natural hazards like coastal flooding with storm surges and typhoons.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A major problem related to coastal regions deals with how the entire global environment is changing and in response, the coastal regions are easily affected.

'''Storms, Flooding and Erosion'''

Storms are one of the major hazards that are associated to coastal regions.  Storms, flooding, and erosion are closely associated and can happen simultaneously.  Tropical storms or Hurricanes especially can devastate coastal regions.  For example, Florida during [[Hurricane Andrew]] occurred in 1992 that caused extreme damage.  It was a category five hurricane that caused $26.5 billion in damages and even 23 individuals lost their lives from the storm.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurricane Katrina also caused havoc along the coast to show the extreme force a hurricane can do in a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;Burby, R. (n.d.). Hurricane katrina . Sage journals, Retrieved from http://ann.sagepub.com/content/604/1/171.short&lt;/ref&gt; The Chennai Floods of 2015, which affected many people, is an example of flooding due to cyclones. People across the whole state of Tamil Nadu felt its impact and even parts of Andhra Pradesh got affected. There was a loss of Rs.900 crore and 280 people died. Many cyclones like this happen across Asia but the media reports only minor hurricanes which hit the United States.

  In almost all cases, storms are the major culprit that causes flooding and erosion.  Flash flooding is caused by storms that occurs when a massive amount of rainfall comes down into an area over a short period of time.  Where as a storm surge, which is closely related to tropical storms, is when the wind collects and pushes water towards low pressure or inland and can rise rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;(2009).  Coastal hazards- natural disasters. Ocean science and stewardship, Retrieved from http://dels-old.nas.edu/oceans/coastal_hazards_part_2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an offshore rise of water and overall creates a higher sea level that rises and is pushed inland.  The amount of rise or fall of storm surge depends greatly on the amount and duration of wind and water in a specific location.  Also if it occurs during a high tide it can have an even greater effect on the coast.

Almost all storms with high wind and water cause erosion along the coast.  Erosion occurs when but not limited to; along shore currents, tides, sea level rise and fall, and high winds.  Larger amounts of erosion cause the coastline to erode away at a faster rate and can leave people homeless and leave less land to develop or keep for environmental reasons.  Coastal erosion has been increasing over the past few years and it is still on the rise which makes it a major coastline hazard.  In the United States, 45 percent of its coast line is along the Atlantic or Gulf coast and the erosion rate per year along the Gulf coast is at six feet a year.  The average rate of erosion along the Atlantic is around two to three feet a year.  Even with these findings, erosion rates in specific locations vary because of various environmental factors such as major storms that can cause major erosion upwards to 100 feet or more in only one day.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA or Federal Emergency Management Agency. (2000). Significant losses from coastal erosion anticipated along u.s. coastlines. Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov /news/newsrelease.fema?id=7708&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pollution, Trawling and Human Development'''
[[File:Loss of Property due to storms.jpg|thumb|right|North Carolina Homes being taken by the Atlantic Ocean 08-23-2011]]
Pollution, trawling, and human development are major human disasters that affect coastal regions.  There are two main categories related to pollution, [[point source pollution]], and [[nonpoint source pollution]].  Point source pollution is when there is an exact location such as a pipeline or a body of water that leads into the rivers and oceans.  Known dumping into the ocean is also another point source of pollution.  Nonpoint source pollution would pertain more to fertilizer runoff, and industrial waste.  Examples of pollution that affect the coastal regions are but are not limited to; fertilizer runoff, oil spills, and dumping of hazardous materials into the oceans.  More human acts that hurt the coastline are as follows; waste discharge, fishing, dredging, mining, and drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, D. (n.d.). Types of coastal zones: similarities and differences. Retrieved from http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&amp;page=67&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil spills are one of the most hazardous dangers towards coastal communities.  They are hard to contain, difficult to clean up, and devastate everything.  The fish, animals such as birds, the water, and especially the coastline near the spill.  The most recent oil spill that had everybody concerned with oil spill was the [[BP oil spill]].

Trawling hurts the normal ecosystems in the water around the coastline.  It depletes all ecosystems on the ocean floor such as, flounder, shellfish, marsh etc.. It is simply a giant net that is drug across the ocean floor and destroys and catches anything in its path.  Human development is one of the major problems when facing coastal hazards.  The overall construction of buildings and houses on the coast line takes away the natural occurrences to handle the fluctuation in water and sea level rise.  Building houses in pre-flood areas or high risk areas that are extremely vulnerable to flooding are major concerns towards human development in coastal regions.  Having houses and buildings in areas that are known to have powerful storms that will create people to be in risk by living there.  Also pertaining to barrier islands, where land is at risk for erosion but they still continue to build there anyway.  More and more houses today are being taken by the ocean; look at picture above.

'''Coastal hazards &amp; climate change'''

The predicted climate change is adding an extra risk factor to human settlement in coastal areas. Whereas the natural dynamics that shape our coastlines have been relatively stable and predictable over the last centuries, much more rapid change is now expected in processes as sea level rise, ocean temperature and acidity, tropical storm intensity and precipitation/runoff patterns.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. 
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The world's coastlines will respond to these changes in different ways and at different pace depending on their bio-geophysical characteristics, but generally society will have to recognize that past coastal trends cannot be directly projected into the future. Instead, it is necessary to consider how different coastal environments will respond to the predicted climate change and take the expected future hazards into account in the coastal planning processes.

== Policies ==

'''National Flood Insurance Program'''

The National Flood Insurance Program or [[NFIP]] was instituted in 1968 and offers home owners in qualifying communities an opportunity to rebuild and recover after flooding events following the decision by insurance companies to discontinue providing flood insurance. This decision was made on behalf of the private insurers after continually high and widespread flood losses. The goals of this program are to not only better protect individuals from flood, but to reduce property losses, and reduce the total amount disbursed for flood loses by the government. Only communities which have adopted and implemented mitigation policies that are compliant with or exceed federal regulations. The regulatory policies reduce risk to life and property located within floodplains. The NFIP also comprehensively mapped domestic floodplains increasing public awareness of risk.  The majority of structures were constructed after the mapping was completed and risk could be assessed. To reduce the cost to these owners, which constitute roughly 25% of the total policies the rates for insurance are subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration. National Flood Insurance Program: Program Description. U.S. Government Press, August 1, 2002 Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1480&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal States Organization'''

The [[Coastal States Organization]] or COS was established in 1970 to represent 35 U.S. sub-federal governments on issues of coastal policies. CSO lobbies Congress on issues pertaining to Coastal Policy allowing states input on federal policy decisions. Funding, support, water quality, coastal hazards, and coastal zone management are the primary issues COS promotes. The strategic goals of COS are to provide information and assistance to members,evaluate and manage coastal needs, and secure long term funding for member states initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;About COS. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.coastalstates.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Zone Management Act'''

In 1972 the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] or CZMA works to streamline the policies which states create to a minimum federal standard for environmental protection. CZMA establishes the national policy for the development and implementation of regulatory programs for coastal land usage, which is supposed to be reflected in state legislation such as CAMA. CZMA also provides minimum building requirements to make the insurance provided through the NFIP less expensive for the government to operate by mitigating losses. Congress found that it was necessary to establish the minimum which programs should provide for. Each coastal state is required to have a program with 7 distinct parts: Identifying land uses,Identifying critical coastal areas, Management measures,Technical assistance, Public participation, Administrative coordination, State coastal zone boundary modification.&lt;ref&gt;(1972). 16 usc chapter 33 – coastal zone management.

'''The Coastal Area Management Act'''

The Coastal Area Management Act or CAMA is policy that was implemented by the state of North Carolina in 1974 to work in-tandem with the CZMA. It creates a cooperative program between the state and local governments. The State government operates in an advisory capacity and reviews decisions made by local government planners. The goal of this legislation was to create a management system capable of preserving the coastal environment, insure the preservation of land and water resources, balance the use of coastal resources and establish guidelines and standards for conservations, economic development, tourism, transportation, and the protection of common law.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, Division of Coastal Management.

== Management and planning ==

Due to the increasing urbanization along the coastlines, planning and management are essential to protecting the ecosystems and environment from depleting. [[Coastal management]] is becoming implemented more because of the movement of people to the shore and the hazards that come with the territory. Some of the hazards include movement of [[barrier island]]s, [[sea level rise]], [[hurricane]]s, [[nor'easter]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[flooding]], [[erosion]], [[pollution]] and human development along the coast. The [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA)  was created in 1972 because of the continued growth along the coast, this act introduced better management practices such as [[integrated coastal zone management]], [[adaptive management]] and the use [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] strategies when planning. According to the Coastal Zone Management Act, the objectives are to remain balanced to "preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the resources of the nation's coastal zone".&lt;ref&gt;National oceanic and atmospheric administration. (2011). Retrieved from http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/czm/czm_act.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of the land can strongly affect the sea,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. Coastal zone management handbook. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZHvKDJSg1PEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=management of coastal hazards&amp;ots=bwKAk06AoG&amp;sig=b9_iBP7OykljD0qtF9BkJutiEUw&lt;/ref&gt; for example the engineering of structures versus non-structures and the effects of erosion along the shore.

'''Integrated coastal zone management'''

Integrated coastal zone management means the integration of all aspects of the coastal zone; this includes environmentally, socially, culturally politically and economically to meet a sustainable balance all around. Sustainability is the goal to allow development yet protect the environment in which we develop. Coastal zones are fragile and do not do well with change so it is important to acquire sustainable development. The integration from all views will entitle a holistic view for the best implementation and management of that country, region and local scales. The five types of integration&lt;ref&gt;CICIN-SAIN, B. 1993. Sustainable Development and Integrated Coastal Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 11–43.&lt;/ref&gt; include integration among sectors, integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone, integration amount levels of government, integration between nations and integration among disciplines are all essential to meet the needs for implementation.
Management practices include
#maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems,without disrupting the environment
#reducing resource-use conflicts, by making sure resources are used adequately and sustainably,
#maintaining the health of the environment, which means to protect the ecosystems and natural cycle,
#facilitating the progress of multisectoral development, which means allowing developers to develop within standards.&lt;ref&gt;THIA-ENG, C. 1993. Essential Elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 81–108.&lt;/ref&gt;
These four management practices should be based on a bottom-up approach, meaning the approach starts from a local level which is more intimate to the specific environment of that area. After assessment from the local level, the state and federal input can be implemented. The bottom-up approach is key for protecting the local environments because there is a diversity of environments that have specific needs all over the world.

'''Adaptive management'''
[[File:Managing Coastal Hazards.gif|thumb|left| Managing Coastal Hazards Chart]]
Adaptive management is another practice of development adaptation with the environment. Resources are the major factor when managing  adaptively to a certain environment to accommodate all the needs of development and ecosystems. Strategies used must be flexible by either passive or active adaptive management include these key features:&lt;ref&gt;Elzinga, C.L., D. W. Salzer, J. W. Willoughby (1998). Measuring and Monitoring Plant Populations. Denver, CO: Bureau of Land Management. BLM Technical Reference 1730-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*AIterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning process)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference (experimentation)
*Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding (trial and error)
To achieve adaptive management is testing the assumptions to achieve a desired outcome, such as trial and error, find the best known strategy then monitoring it to adapt to the environment, and learning the outcomes of success and failures of a project.

'''Mitigation'''
[[File:Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Relocation due to high energy wave activity.jpg|thumb|right|Relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, NC, Failure of groin to protect the coast]]
The purpose of [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] is not only to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resources&lt;ref&gt;Race, Margret. , &amp; Christie, Donna, (n.d.). Coastal zone development: Mitigation and decision-making. 6(4), 317–328. Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/r078478127573341/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline.  Structural management deals with the use of the following: groins which are man-made solution to [[longshore drift|longshore current]] movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.
The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline. Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.

'''Cobblestone''' is a natural building material based on [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]-sized stones, and is used for [[Road surface|pavement roads]], streets, and buildings.

In England, it was commonplace since ancient times for flat stones with a flat narrow edge to be set on edge to provide an even paved surface. This was known as a 'pitched' surface and was common all over Britain, as it did not require rounded pebbles. Pitched surfaces predate the use of regularly-sized granite setts by more than a thousand years. Such pitched paving is quite distinct from that formed from rounded stones, although both forms are commonly referred to as 'cobbled' surfaces. Most surviving genuinely old 'cobbled' areas are in reality pitched surfaces. A cobbled area is known as a "causey", "cassay" or "cassie" in [[Scots language|Scots]] (probably from ''causeway'').&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary Association (1999) ''Concise Scots Dictionary ''. Edinburgh, Polygon. {{ISBN|1-902930-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sett (paving)|Setts]] are often idiomatically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cobble?region=uk|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|title=Cobble |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as "cobbles", although a sett is distinct from a cobblestone by being quarried or shaped to a regular form, whereas cobblestone is generally of a naturally occurring form.

==Use in roading==
Cobblestones are typically either set in sand or similar material, or are bound together with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Paving with cobblestones allows a road to be heavily used all year long. It prevents the build-up of [[Rut (roads)|ruts]] often found in [[dirt road]]s. It has the additional advantage of not getting muddy in wet weather or dusty in dry weather. Shod horses are also able to get better traction on stone cobbles, pitches or setts than tarmac/asphalt. The fact that [[carriage]] [[wheel]]s, [[horse]] [[hooves]] and even modern automobiles make a lot of noise when rolling over cobblestone paving might be thought a disadvantage, but it has the advantage of warning pedestrians of their approach. In England, the custom was to strew the cobbles outside the house of a sick or dying person with straw to dampen the sound.

Cobblestones set in sand have the environmental advantage of being [[permeable paving]], and of moving rather than cracking with movements in the ground.

===Use today===
Cobblestones were largely replaced by quarried granite [[Sett (paving)|setts]] (also known as Belgian block&lt;ref name="belgianblock"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A27568|title=Were Pittsburgh's original finished roads and streets paved with cobblestone, Belgian block or some other type of brick?|last=Potter|first=Chris|date=14 October 2004|work=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]|accessdate=23 September 2009|quote=In fact, Belgian block refers not to the type of stone but the way it is cut: in rectangles. People often refer to roads paved this way as "cobblestone streets," but that isn't strictly correct. Cobblestones are rounded, typically because they've been worn smooth by rivers. They might be hell to drive on, but they were cheap: you could just dredge them up from the river, the same way the Pirates put together the roster for their farm teams.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the nineteenth century. The word cobblestone is often wrongly used to describe such treatment. Setts were relatively even and roughly rectangular stones that were laid in regular patterns. They gave a smoother ride for carts than cobbles, although in heavily used sections, such as in yards and the like, the usual practice was to replace the setts by parallel granite slabs set apart by the standard axle length of the time.

Cobblestoned and "setted" streets gradually gave way to [[macadam]] roads, and later to [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], and finally to [[asphalt concrete]] at the beginning of the 20th century. However, cobble&amp;shy;stones are often retained in historic areas, even for streets with modern vehicular traffic. Many older villages and cities in [[Europe]] are still paved with cobblestones or pitched.

Popular television soap opera [[Coronation Street sets|Coronation Street]] has cobblestones and they are often referenced in relation to reports on the show.

In recent decades, cobblestones have become a popular material for paving newly [[pedestrian]]ised streets in Europe. In this case, the noisy nature of the surface is an advantage as pedestrians can hear approaching vehicles. The visual cues of the cobblestones also clarify that the area is more than just a normal street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Architect: Open Salem pedestrian mall to cars, parking |url=http://www.salemnews.com/local/x2036003030/Architect-Open-Salem-pedestrian-mall-to-cars-parking |accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=The Salem News|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cobblestones/setts is also considered to be a more "upmarket" roadway solution, having been described as "unique and artistic" compared to the normal asphalt road environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frances Page|first=Cecilia|title=Authentic Insights|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Setts cobblestones.JPG|thumb|right|Setts visible beneath cracked asphalt in New Bedford, MA.]]
In older U.S. cities such as [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref name="belgianblock" /&gt; [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Portland, Maine|Portland (Maine)]], [[Baltimore]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[New Orleans]], many of the older streets are paved in cobblestones and setts (mostly setts); however, many such streets have been paved over with asphalt, which can crack and erode away due to heavy traffic, thus revealing the original stone pavement.

In some places such as [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], as late as the 1990s some busy intersections still showed cobblestones through worn down sections of pavement. In Toronto streets using setts were used by streetcar routes and disappeared by the 1980s, but are still found in the [[Distillery District]].

Many cities in Latin America, such as [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]; [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] and [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], in [[Mexico]]; [[Old San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]; [[Philippines]], [[Vigan]]; and [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], are well known for their many cobblestone streets, which are still operational and in good condition. They are still maintained and repaired the traditional manner, by placing and arranging granite stones by hand.

In the [[Czech Republic]], there are old cobblestone paths with colored [[marble]]s and [[limestone]]s. The design with three colors (red/limestone, black/limestone, white/marble) has a long tradition in [[Bohemia]]. The cubes of the old ways are handmade.

==Use in architecture==
{{main|Cobblestone architecture}}

In the [[Finger Lakes]] Region of New York State, the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age left numerous small, rounded cobblestones available for building.  Pre-Civil War architecture in the region made heavy use of cobblestones for walls.  Today, the fewer than 600 remaining cobblestone buildings are prized as historic locations, most of them private homes. They are clustered south of Lake Ontario, between Buffalo and Syracuse. There is also a cluster of cobblestone buildings in the Town of [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]], [[Ontario]]. In addition to homes, cobblestones were used to build barns, stagecoach taverns, smokehouses, stores, churches, schools, factories, and cemetery markers. The history of building with cobblestones and 17 driving tours to see the remaining structures are found in "''Cobblestone Quest - Road Tours of New York's Historic Buildings''".

The only public cobblestone building is the [[Alexander Classical School]], located in [[Alexander (village), New York|Alexander, New York]].

==Use in cycling==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In cycling road races, cobblestones are used as an additional difficulty for the riders. It requires a certain skill to ride cobblestones efficiently, without falling or getting a flat tire. [[Tour of Flanders]] and [[Paris–Roubaix]] are notable [[cobbled classics]].

{{Over-quotation|date=December 2015}}
In [[philosophy of science]] and [[philosophy of mind]], '''cognitive closure''' is the proposition that human minds are constitutionally incapable of solving certain perennial philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Marsh (ed.), ''Hayek in Mind: Hayek's Philosophical Psychology'', Emerald Group Publishing, 2011, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Flanagan]] calls this position '''anti-constructive naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or the "[[new mysterianism]]" and the primary advocate of the hypothesis, [[Colin McGinn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Errol E | last = Harris | title = Reflections on the Problem of Consciousness | year = 2006 | page = 51 | quote = McGinn's stance, while he denies the possibility of ever understanding the causal connection, may be regarded as "naturalistic" in the sense that he does not reject the validity of neuro-physiological theory, and does not doubt that brain activity accompanies conscious states.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross Wilson (ed.), ''The Meaning of "Life" in Romantic Poetry and Poetics'', Routledge, 2009, p. 88: "[McGinn] calls his stance "transcendental naturalism..."&lt;/ref&gt; calls it '''transcendental naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; acknowledging the possibility that solutions may be an intelligent non-human of some kind. According to McGinn, such philosophical questions include the [[mind-body problem]], [[personal identity|identity of the self]], [[meaning (philosophy of language)|foundations of meaning]], [[free will]], and [[epistemology|knowledge]], both ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and [[empiricism|empirical]].&lt;ref name = "McGinn1994"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Philosophical Studies |volume=76 |year=1994 | pages =133–56 | doi=10.1007/bf00989821 |url= http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/consciousness97/papers/ProblemOfPhilosophy.html |title= The Problem of Philosophy |first=Colin |last=McGinn | quote =it combines deep epistemic transcendence with the denial that what thus transcends is thereby non-natural.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colin McGinn==
{{quote|It cannot be simply taken for granted that the human reasoning faculty is naturally suited for answering philosophical questions: the questions and their subject matter are one thing; and rational faculty, as a human trait, is another. From the fact that it is the best faculty we have… for doing philosophy it does not follow that it is a remotely good or adequate faculty for that purpose.&lt;ref name = "lim"&gt;{{Citation | first = Colin | last = McGinn | title = Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry | year = 1993 | page = 31 | quote = There is, I believe, a systematic pattern to philosophical disputation, in which the same kinds of unsatisfying alternatives recur}}.&lt;/ref&gt; |Colin McGinn|''Problems in Philosophy: The Limits of Inquiry''}}
{{quote |When human minds interact with philosophical problems, especially those of the form 'How is X possible?', they are apt to go into one of four possible states. Either (i) they try to domesticate the object of puzzlement by providing a reductive or explanatory theory of it; or (ii) they declare it irreducible and hence not open to any levelling account; or (iii) they succumb to a magical story or image of what seems so puzzling; or (iv) they simply eliminate the source of trouble for fear of ontological embarrassment... The topics on which it imprints itself, and which I have discussed in some diagnostic detail in the aforementioned book, include: consciousness and the mind-body problem, the nature and identity of the self, the foundations of meaning, the possibility of free will, the availability of a priori and empirical knowledge...  Basically what we find, quite generally, is the threat of magic or elimination in the face of the theoretical obduracy of the phenomenon that invites philosophical attention. The phenomenon presents initial problems of possibility... Free will, for instance, looks upon early inspection to be impossible, so we try to find some conception of it that permits its existence, but this conception always turns out to be dubiously reductive and distorting, leaving us with the unpalatable options of magic, elimination or quietism... so we hop unhappily from one unsatisfactory option to the next; or dig our heels (squintingly) into a position that seems the least intellectually unconscionable of the bunch... Science, then, might be aptly characterised as that set of questions that does not attract [these] options – where our cognitive faculties allow us to form the necessary concepts and theories. The distinction between science and philosophy is, on this view, at root a reflection of the cognitive powers we happen to possess or lack, and is therefore creature-relative: it does not correspond to any interesting real division within objective reality... It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that our brains would have to be made of something other than neurons in order for us to have the kinds of cognitive powers needed to solve the problems philosophy poses; at any rate, this is the sort of diagnosis [transcendental naturalism] offers for our philosophical retardation... The hardness of philosophy is thus an upshot of the particular way that natural selection has built our thinking organ, not an objective trait of the subject-matter of philosophical questions.&lt;ref name ="McGinn1994" /&gt;|Colin McGinn|"Problems in Philosophy" in ''Philosophical Studies''}}

==Friedrich Hayek==
For [[Friedrich Hayek]], "The whole idea of the mind explaining itself is a logical contradiction"... and "takes this incompleteness—the constitutional inability of mind to explain itself—to be a generalized case of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]... Hayek is ''not'' a naturalistic agnostic, that is, the view that science ''currently'' cannot offer an explanation of the mind-body relationship, but in principle it could."&lt;ref name ="Butos2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=W.N. | last =Butos |year=2010 |title=The Social Science of Hayek's The Sensory Order | series = Advances in [[Austrian Economics]] | publisher =Emerald |isbn=978-1-84950975-6 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Uo4pjUvVmHEC&amp;pg=PA127 | pages = 127–28 | quote=1. ''Explanation'' is delimited by the apparatus of classification (the mind)... 2. An apparatus of classification cannot ''explain'' anything more complex than itself... 3.

==John Tyndall==
{{quote | [The] passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of consciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought, and a definite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously; we do not possess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the organ, which would enable us to pass, by a process of reasoning, from the one to the other. They appear together, but we do not know why. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the brain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their groupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be; and were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and feeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem, "How are these physical processes connected with the facts of consciousness?" The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would still remain intellectually impassable. Let the consciousness of love, for example, be associated with a right-handed spiral motion of the molecules of the brain, and the consciousness of hate with a left-handed spiral motion. We should then know, when we love, that the motion is in one direction, and, when we hate, that the motion is in the other; but the "Why?" would remain as unanswerable as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tyndall | first = John | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hipQtHDerYQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=86#PPA86,M1 | title = Fragments of Science | date = 1871 | pages = 86–87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|John Tyndall (1871)|''Fragments of Science''}}

==Noam Chomsky==
[[Noam Chomsky]] argues that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology and that certain problems may be beyond our understanding:
{{quote |A Martian scientist, with a mind different from ours might regard this problem [of free will] as trivial, and wonder why humans never seem to hit on the obvious way of solving it.  This observer might also be amazed at the ability of every human child to acquire language, something that seems to him incomprehensible, requiring divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Noam | last = Chomsky | title = Language and problems of knowledge | year = 1988 | page = 152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|Noam Chomsky|''Language and problems of knowledge''}}

==Phenomena and noumena==
As argued in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', human thinking is unavoidably structured by [[categories of the understanding]]:
{{Quote | '''Quantity''' – Unity, Plurality, Totality.&lt;br&gt;
'''Quality''' – [[Reality]], Negation, Limitation.&lt;br&gt;
'''Relation''' – [[Inherence]] and Subsistence, [[Causality]] and Dependence, Community.&lt;br&gt;
'''Modality''' – [[Logical possibility|Possibility]] or Impossibility, [[Existence]] or Non-Existence, Necessity or Contingence.}}

These are ideas to which there is no escape, thus they pose a limit to thinking. What can be known through the categories is called [[phenomena]] and what is outside the categories is called [[noumena]], the unthinkable "things in themselves".

==New mysterians==
{{main|New mysterianism}}
In his (famous) essay "[[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?]]" [[Thomas Nagel]] mentions the possibility of cognitive closure to the [[subjective character of experience]] and the (deep) implications that it has for [[materialism|materialist]] [[reductionism|reductionist]] [[science]]. [[Owen Flanagan]] noted in his 1991 book ''Science of the Mind'' that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness will never be completely explained. Flanagan called them "the new mysterians" after the rock group [[Question Mark and the Mysterians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Flanagan |title=The Science of the Mind |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-262-56056-9 |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to McGinn, the solution to the [[mind-body problem]] cannot be grasped, despite the fact that the solution is "written in our genes".

[[Emergent materialism]] is a similar but different claim that humans are not smart enough to determine "the relationship between [[mind]] and matter."{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

'''Deistic evolution''' is a position in the [[origins debate]] which involves accepting the [[scientific]] evidence for [[evolution]] and age of the [[universe]] whilst advocating the view that a [[deist]]ic [[God]] created the universe but has not interfered since. The position is a counterpoint to [[theistic evolution]] and is endorsed by those who believe in both [[deism]] and the veracity of science.

==Various views on deistic evolution==

In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8birAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;dq=deistic+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI2NPFwPLdxgIViBo-Ch1TWwAE#v=onepage&amp;q=deistic%20evolution&amp;f=false Christian Theology]'', by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:

{{quote|Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws its development has followed. Thus, he programmed the process and then withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator Emeritus. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution, for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process.
Deistic evolution has little difficulty with the scientific data. There is a definite conflict, however, between deism's view of an absentee God and the biblical picture of a God who has been involved in a whole series of creative acts. In particular, both Genesis accounts of the origin of human beings indicate that God definitely and distinctly willed and acted to bring them into existence. In addition, deistic evolution conflicts with the scriptural doctrine of providence, according to which God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.}}

The [[psychologist]] Steve Stewart-Williams&lt;ref&gt;[http://psy.swan.ac.uk/staff/stewart-williams/ Homepage for Dr Steve Stewart-Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' (2010) states:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolutionists hold that God created the universe and the laws of nature... but that once the ball was rolling, he ceased to intervene in the day-today running of the world or in the course of natural law. God was like the ether after Einstein: he no longer had any role to play in the universe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' 2010 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips [[God]] of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for [[prayer]]s, [[miracles]] or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with [[monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was [[Michael Anthony Corey]], author of the book ''Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution'' (1994).

Some scholars have written that [[Charles Darwin]] was an advocate of deistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent ''Evolution and Creationism: A Documentary and Reference Guide'' 2007, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic evolution is similarly the operative idea  in [[Pandeism]], which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which "are compatible with modern [[science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theistic predeterminism==
Deistic evolution is not the same as [[theistic evolution]], yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a [[deism|deistic god]] that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.

==Criticism from Christian Creationists==

Deistic evolution has been criticised by Christian [[creationists]] as being incompatible with [[Christianity]] since it contradicts a literal reading of the [[Bible]] and more importantly, leaves no role for the "Christian personal God".&lt;ref&gt;James K. A. Smith, Amos Yong ''Science and the Spirit: A Pentecostal Engagement With the Sciences'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liberty: a magazine of religious freedom: Volumes 86-88, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which "God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation."&lt;ref&gt;Erickson M.J., "Christian Theology", 1985, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, "Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Higher Criticism and the Bible," by Charles P. Grannan, DD, PhD, in ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', 1894, Volume 19, Page 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that [[gravity]] was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:

{{quote|If evolution is God's method of creating he is still at work. Theistic Deism and evolution is possible, but deistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. Again, it is all a mere supposition that God created the world and endowed it with forces which will of necessity work out his will. It is impossible for us to say that God put forth energy in the beginning and then ceased. It is, to say the least, as probable that gravitation is a divine force constantly exerted on matter in a certain way as that it is a divine force deposited in matter once for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Christian Faith'' by Charles Wesley Rishell, 1899, Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Science==

Deistic evolution does not oppose or contradict [[evolution]] or come into conflict with [[science]] as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.

Stewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolution eliminates any immediate conflict between science and belief in God. Anyone who believes that God's role was merely to create the laws of nature can accept the scientific worldview in its totality; they simply add the proviso that 'God did it' - i.e., that God is responsible for the world that science describes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is considerable room for this "[[god of the gaps]]" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the [[Planck epoch]], the earliest 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:

*God created the universe, perhaps using the "big bang" about 15,000 million years ago as his method. He set up basic laws to govern the running of the universe, and then left the scene entirely. God has not been seen since. The earth coalesced about 4 or 5 thousand million years ago without any input from God. Later, elementary life forms formed, which evolved into the animals and plant life that we see today through purely natural forces. It is essentially identical to naturalistic evolution, excepts that it reserves one action for God: that of initially creating the matter of the universe. This belief is common among Deists. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_world3.htm]
*Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws which its devel- opment has followed. Thus, he programmed the process. Then he withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator emeritus. The progress of the created order is free of direct influence by God. He is the Creator of everything, but only the first living form was directly created. All the rest of God's creating has been done indirectly. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process. [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199505-10/0171.html]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in [[St. Peter's Square]]:

:When the Pontiff finished his address, he put his papers to one side and commented on the thought of St. Basil the Great, a Doctor of the Church, who said that some, "deceived by the atheism they bear within them, imagined the universe deprived of a guide and order, at the mercy of chance. I believe the words of this fourth-century Father are of amazing timeliness," said Benedict XVI. "How many are these 'some' today? Deceived by atheism, they believe and try to demonstrate that it is scientific to think that everything lacks a guide and order," he continued.

The term '''directed evolution''' is used within the [[transhumanist]] community to refer to the idea of applying the principles of [[directed evolution]] and [[experimental evolution]] to the control of human evolution.&lt;ref name=mehlman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Mehlman|title=Will Directed Evolution Destroy Humanity, and If So, What Can We Do About It?|url=http://www.slu.edu/Documents/law/SLUJHP/Mehlman_Article.pdf|publisher=3 St. Louis U.J.

Maxwell J. Melhmanh has described directed evolution of humans as the Holy Grail of [[transhumanism]].&lt;ref name = mehlman/&gt;
Oxford philosopher [[Julian Savulescu]] wrote that:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity until this point has been a story of evolution for the survival genes - survival and reproduction ... we are entering a new phase of human evolution—evolution under reason—where human beings are masters of their destiny. Power has been transferred from nature to science.
 |source = [[Julian Savulescu]] &lt;ref name=Savulescu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savulescu|first1=Julian|title=Human-Animal Transgenesis and Chimeras Might Be an Expression of Our Humanity|journal=Journal of Bioethics|date=2003|volume=3|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] biophysicist [[Gregory Stock]]:
{{Quote
 |quote  = Humanity is leaving its childhood and moving into its adolescence as its powers infuse into realms hitherto beyond our reach.
 |source = [[Gregory Stock]] &lt;ref name=gstock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stock|first1=Gregory|title=Germinal Choice Technology and the Human Future|journal=Ethics L. &amp; Moral Phil. Reprod. Biomedicine|date=2005|volume=10|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 |width  = 90%

}}

[[Riccardo Campa]], from the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]], wrote that "self-directed evolution" can be coupled with many different political, philosophical, and religious views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campa|first1=Riccardo|title=Toward a transhumanist politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/campa20090622/|website=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that referring to [[transhumanism]] as directed evolution is problematic because evolution is ateleological and transhumanism is [[teleological]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Askland|first1=Andrew|title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution|journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|pages=71–78|url=https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227044619/https://www.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participant evolution==
Participant evolution is an alternative term that refers to the process of deliberately redesigning the [[human body]] and [[Human brain|brain]] using [[Technology|technological]] means, rather than through the natural processes of [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]], with the goal of removing "biological limitations" and human enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=28HEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|title=Human Nature in an Age of Biotechnology: The Case for Mediated Posthumanism|first=Tamar|last=Sharon|date=11 October 2013|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LiOheK_2uZ8C&amp;pg=PA376|title=Biomedicalization: Technoscience, Health, and Illness in the U.S.|first1=Adele E.|last1=Clarke|first2=Laura|last2=Mamo|first3=Jennifer Ruth|last3=Fosket|first4=Jennifer R.|last4=Fishman|first5=Janet K.|last5=Shim|date=1 January 2009|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WgPHCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179|title=The Cybernetics Moment: Or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age|first=Ronald R.|last=Kline|date=25 June 2015|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mZLV5wLbQvAC&amp;pg=PA58|title=Iphigenias at Aulis: Textual Multiplicity, Radical Philology|first=Sean Alexander|last=Gurd|date=1 January 2005|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WK3Wj2bwHScC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Panic Diaries: A Genealogy of Panic Disorder|first=Jackie|last=Orr|date=8 February 2006|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Ix1HCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|title=Transcend the Flesh: Transhumanism debate|first=Tobiasz|last=Mazan|date=17 April 2015|publisher=Tobiasz Mazan|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g7mZw8FSHpwC|title=Beyond Human: From Animality to Transhumanism|first1=Charlie|last1=Blake|first2=Claire|last2=Molloy|first3=Steven|last3=Shakespeare|date=15 March 2012|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7CIeXt8yIhkC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Frontiers of Cyberspace|first=Daniel|last=Riha|date=28 December 2016|publisher=Rodopi|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=629wC2skzb0C&amp;pg=PA125|title=Rape of the Wild: Man's Violence Against Animals and the Earth|first1=Andrée|last1=Collard|first2=Joyce|last2=Contrucci|date=1 January 1989|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=pDg3jDHDBSUC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Shaw and Science Fiction|first=Milton T.|last=Wolf|date=1 January 1997|publisher=[[Penn State Press]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |date=1961 |title=Drugs, Space, and Cybernetics: Evolution to Cyborgs |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208174752/http://www.microsoundmusic.com/home/microsound/.blogs/post8883/Drugs%2C%20Space%2C%20and%20Cybernetics%3B%20Evolution%20to%20Cyborgs.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

volume=September}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they argued that the human species was already on a path of participant evolution. [[Science fiction]] writers have speculated what the next stage of such participant evolution will be.

Whilst Clynes and Kline saw participant evolution as the process of creating [[cyborg]]s, the idea has been adopted and propounded by [[Transhumanism|transhumanists]] who argue that individuals should have the choice of using [[human enhancement]] technologies on themselves and their children, to progressively become [[transhuman]] and ultimately [[posthuman]], as part of a voluntary regimen of participant evolution.

'''Dry stone''', sometimes called '''drystack''' or, in Scotland, '''drystane''', is a building method by which structures are constructed from [[Rock (geology)|stones]] without any [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to bind them together.&lt;ref name="arts"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Seymour | first = John | title = The Forgotten Arts A practical guide to traditional skills | publisher = Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers | date = 1984 &lt;!--copyright by Dorling Kindersley Limited, London. Text copyright 1984 by John Seymour--&gt; | location = page 54 | pages = 192 | isbn = 0-207-15007-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry stone structures are stable because of their unique construction method, which is characterized by the presence of a load-bearing façade of carefully selected interlocking stones.

Dry stone construction is best known in the context of [[stone wall]]s, traditionally used for the boundaries of fields and [[churchyard]]s, or as [[retaining wall]]s for terracing, but dry stone sculptures, buildings, bridges, and other structures also exist.

The art of dry stone walling, was inscribed in 2018 on the [[UNESCO]] representative [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity]], for dry stone walls in countries such as [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/art-of-dry-stone-walling-knowledge-and-techniques-01393|title=Art of dry stone walling, knowledge and techniques - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[File:Mycenae lion gate dsc06382.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion Gate]] of the [[Mycenae]] acropolis, Greece, is dry stone.]]

Some dry-stone wall constructions in north-west Europe have been dated back to the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] Age. Some Cornish hedges are believed by the Guild of Cornish Hedgers to date from 5000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.cornishhedges.co.uk/PDF/prehistoric.pdf | title = Prehistoric Hedges in Cornwall (5000BC - AD450) | publisher = Guild of Cornish Hedgers | website = www.cornishhedges.co.uk | author = Robin Menneer | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2011-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there appears to be little dating evidence. In [[County Mayo]], Ireland, an entire field system made from dry-stone walls, since covered in peat, have been carbon-dated to 3800 BC. The [[cyclopean]] walls of the [[acropolis]] of [[Mycenae]], Greece, have been dated to 1350 BC and those of [[Tiryns]] slightly earlier. In [[Belize]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Lubaantun]] illustrate use of dry stone construction in architecture of the 8th and 9th centuries AD.

== Location and terminology ==

Terminology varies regionally. When used as field boundaries, dry stone structures often are known as dykes, particularly in [[Scotland]].  Dry stone walls are characteristic of upland areas of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] where rock outcrops naturally or large stones exist in quantity in the soil. They are especially abundant in the West of Ireland, particularly [[Connemara]]. They may also be found throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including retaining walls used for terracing. Such constructions are common where large stones are plentiful (for example, in [[The Burren]]) or conditions are too harsh for hedges capable of retaining livestock to be grown as reliable field boundaries. Many thousands of miles of such walls exist, most of them centuries old.

In the [[United States]] they are common in areas with rocky soils, such as [[New England]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] and are a notable characteristic of the [[bluegrass region]] of central [[Kentucky]] as well as [[Virginia]], where they are usually referred to as ''rock fences'' or ''stone fences'', and the [[Napa Valley]] in north central [[California]]. The technique of construction was brought to America primarily by [[English people|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] immigrants. The technique was also taken to [[Australia]] (principally western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and some parts of [[Tasmania]] and [[New South Wales]]) and [[New Zealand]] (especially [[Otago]]).

[[File:DryStoneArt.jpg|thumb|[[Mosaic]] embedded in a dry stone wall in Italian [[Switzerland]]]]

Similar walls also are found in the Swiss-Italian border region, where they are often used to enclose the open space under large natural boulders or outcrops.

The higher-lying rock-rich fields and pastures in [[Bohemia]]'s South-Western border range of [[Šumava]] (e.g. around the mountain river of Vydra) are often lined by dry stone walls built of [[fieldstone|field-stones]] removed from the arable or cultural land. They serve both as cattle/sheep fences and the lot's borders. Sometimes also the dry stone terracing is apparent, often combined with parts of stone [[masonry]] (house foundations and shed walls) that are held together by a clay-cum-needles {{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} "composite" [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. {{Elucidate|date=May 2016}} {{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

In [[Peru]] in the 15th century AD, the [[Inca]] made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building dry stone walls to create [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]]. They also employed this mode of construction for freestanding walls. Their [[ashlar]] type construction in [[Machu Picchu]] uses the classic [[Inca architecture|Inca architectural style]] of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar. Many junctions are so perfect that not even a knife fits between the stones. The structures have persisted in the high earthquake region because of the flexibility of the walls and that in their double wall architecture, the two portions of the walls incline into each other.

== Construction ==

[[File:Dry stone globe.jpg|thumb|Boundary wall of a pub featuring a dry stone sculpture, in the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Gloucestershire]], UK]]

A wall's style and method of construction will vary, depending on the type of stone available, its intended use and local tradition. Most older walls are constructed from stones and [[boulders]] cleared from the fields during preparation for agriculture&lt;ref&gt;See "The Character of a Wall. The changing construction of agricultural walls on the island of Gozo", http://www.omertaa.org/archive/omertaa0006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (''field stones'') but many also from stone quarried nearby. For modern walls, quarried stone is almost always used. The type of wall built will depend on the nature of the stones available.
[[File:3.-Pedra en sec (26051155523).jpg|350px|thumb|left|Construction work on dry stone. Illustration of the [[Valencian Museum of Ethnology]]]]
One type of wall is called a "double" wall and is constructed by placing two rows of stones along the boundary to be walled. The foundation stones are ideally set into the ground so as to rest firmly on the subsoil. The rows are composed of large flattish stones, diminishing in size as the wall rises. Smaller stones may be used as chocks in areas where the natural stone shape is more rounded. The walls are built up to the desired height layer-by-layer (''course by course'') and, at intervals, large [[Perpend|tie-stones]] or ''through stones'' are placed which span both faces of the wall and sometimes project. These have the effect of bonding what would otherwise be two thin walls leaning against each other, greatly increasing the strength of the wall. Diminishing the width of the wall as it gets higher, as traditionally done in Britain, also strengthens the wall considerably. The voids between the facing stones are carefully packed with smaller stones (''filling'', ''hearting'').

The final layer on the top of the wall also consists of large stones, called ''capstones'', ''coping stones'' or ''copes''. As with the tie stones, the capstones span the entire width of the wall and prevent it breaking apart. In some areas, such as South Wales, there is a tradition of placing the coping stones on a final layer of flat stones slightly wider than the top of the wall proper (''coverbands'').

In addition to gates a wall may contain smaller purposely built gaps for the passage or control of wildlife and [[livestock]] such as sheep. The smaller holes usually no more than 8&amp;nbsp; inches in height are called 'Bolt Holes' or 'Smoots'. Larger ones may be between eighteen and 24 inches in height, these are called a 'Cripple Hole'.&lt;ref&gt;See the "Cripple hole" and "Smoot" entries in the glossary at the end of ''Dry Stone Walling'', https://www.conservationhandbooks.com/dry-stone-walling/glossary/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulder walls are a type of single wall in which the wall consists primarily of large boulders, around which smaller stones are placed. Single walls work best with large, flatter stones. Ideally, the largest stones are being placed at the bottom and the whole wall tapers toward the top. Sometimes a row of capstones completes the top of a wall, with the long rectangular side of each [[Coping (architecture)|capstone]] perpendicular to the wall alignment.

[[File:Galloway Dyke on Fetlar.jpg|thumb|Galloway dyke on [[Fetlar]], [[Shetland Islands]], [[UK]]]]

[[Galloway]] dykes consist of a base of double-wall construction or larger boulders with single-wall construction above. They appear to be rickety, with many holes, which deters livestock (and people) from attempting to cross them. These dykes are principally found in locations with exceptionally high winds, where a solid wall might be at risk of being unsettled by the buffeting. The porous nature of the wall significantly reduces wind force but takes greater skill to construct. They are also found in grazing areas where they are used to maximize the utility of the available stones (where ploughing was not turning up ever more stones).

Another variation is the "[[Cornish hedge]]" or Welsh ''clawdd'', which is a stone-clad earth bank topped by turf, scrub, or trees and characterised by a strict inward-curved [[Batter (walls)|batter]] (the slope of the "hedge"). As with many other varieties of wall, the height is the same as the width of the base, and the top is half the base width.

Different regions have made minor modifications to the general method of construction — sometimes because of limitations of building material available, but also to create a look that is distinctive for that area. Whichever method is used to build a dry stone wall, considerable skill is required. Correcting any mistakes invariably means disassembling down to the level of the error. Selection of the correct stone for every position in the wall makes an enormous difference to the lifetime of the finished product, and a skilled waller will take time making the selection.

As with many older crafts, skilled wallers, today, are few in number. With the advent of modern wire fencing, fields can be fenced with much less time and expense using wire than using stone walls; however, the initial expense of building dykes is offset by their sturdiness and consequent long, low-maintenance lifetimes. As a result of the increasing appreciation of the landscape and heritage value of dry stone walls, wallers remain in demand, as do the walls themselves. A nationally recognised certification scheme is operated in the UK by the Dry Stone Walling Association, with four grades from Initial to Master Craftsman.

Notable examples include:
* [[Mourne Wall]]: twenty-two mile long wall in the [[Mourne Mountains]] location in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]]
* [[Ottenby]] nature reserve, built by [[Charles X Gustav]] in mid 17th century, [[Öland]], Sweden

== Other uses ==
[[File:Machupicchu intihuatana.JPG|thumb|Intihuatana ritual buildings of dry stone at [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]]]]

While the dry-stone technique is generally used for field enclosures, it also was used for buildings. The traditional turf-roofed Highland [[blackhouse]] was constructed using the double wall dry stone method. When buildings are constructed using this method, the middle of the wall is generally filled with earth or sand in order to eliminate draughts. During the Iron Age, and perhaps earlier, the technique also was used to build fortifications such as the walls of [[Eketorp Castle]] ([[Öland]], [[Sweden]]), [[Maiden Castle, North Yorkshire]], [[Reeth]], [[Dunlough Castle]] in southwest Ireland and the rampart of the Long Scar Dyke. Many of the dry-stone walls that exist today in Scotland can be dated to the 14th century or earlier when they were built to divide fields and retain livestock. Some extremely well built examples are found on the lands of [[Muchalls Castle]].

Dry stone walls can be built against embankments or even vertical terraces. If they are subjected to lateral earth pressure, they are retaining walls of the type gravity wall. The weight of the stones resists the pressure from the retained soil, including any surcharges, and the friction between the stones causes most of them to act as if being a monolithic gravity wall of the same weight. Dry stone retaining walls were once built in great numbers for agricultural terracing and also to carry paths, roads and railways. Although dry stone is seldom used for these purposes today, a great many are still in use and maintained. New ones are often built in gardens and nature conservation areas. Dry stone retaining structures continue to be a subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/C0C88DB0-86CB-4262-BDCC-2DA9E7CFCC45#tabPublications&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olandalbymedbridge.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval]] dry stone bridge in [[Alby, Öland|Alby, Sweden]]]]

Since at least the [[Middle Ages]] some bridges capable of carrying horse or carriage traffic have been constructed using drystone techniques. An example of a well-preserved bridge of this type is a double arched [[limestone]] bridge in [[Alby, Öland|Alby, Sweden]] on the island of [[Öland]], ''(shown at right)''.

In northeastern [[Somalia]], on the coastal plain 20&amp;nbsp;km to [[Aluula]]'s east are found ruins of an ancient monument in a platform style. The structure is formed by a rectangular dry stone wall that is low in height; the space in between is filled with rubble and manually covered with small stones. Relatively large standing stones are also positioned on the edifice's corners. Near the platform are graves, which are outlined in stones. 24 m by 17 m in dimension, the structure is the largest of a string of ancient platform and enclosed platform monuments exclusive to far northeastern Somalia.&lt;ref name="Ncaaroth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chittick|first=Neville|title=An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Horn: The British-Somali Expedition|year=1975|pages=117–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burial sites near [[Burao]] in the northwestern part of the country likewise feature a number of old [[stela]]e.&lt;ref name="Shaanm"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums|url=http://www.somaliheritage.org/museums.php|publisher=Somali Heritage and Archaeology|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DryStoneMarkingA.jpg|thumb|Dry stone marking or [[cairn]]]]

In Great Britain, Ireland and Switzerland, it is possible to find small dry stone structures built as signs, marking mountain paths or boundaries of owned land. In many countries, [[cairn]]s, as they are called in Scotland, are used as road and mountain top markers.

The '''eagle bone whistle''' is a highly [[sacred]] religious object, used by some members of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual societies in particularly sacred ceremonies. They are made from bones of either the American [[bald eagle]] or the American [[golden eagle]], and are considered extremely powerful spiritual objects.&lt;ref name="Maroukis"&gt;Maroukis, Thomas Constantine (2005).

==Federal law==
Both the bald and golden eagle are protected by federal law: the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit as outlined at  [[Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations|50 CFR]] 21.11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/22.1 |title= 50 CFR 22.1 - What is the purpose of this part? |publisher=Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute | accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf | date=17 September 1999 | title = Migratory Bird Management Information: List of Protected Birds (10.13) Questions and Answers | publisher = [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 7 August 2015 | format = PDF}} As amended 20 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the hunting of migratory birds should be allowed, as well as to adopt and implement suitable regulations permitting and governing the hunting of any type of migratory bird (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). The [[Eagle feather law]] is another name for the exemptions to this act that are sometimes granted to enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemeanor conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/environment/ac-cn-eagles-drones-0423-story.html Drone pilot buzzed Bald Eagle's Nest] Capital Gazette.

'''Crustal evolution''' involves the formation, destruction and renewal of the rocky outer shell at the [[Earth]]'s surface.

The variation in composition within the Earth's crust is much greater than other [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial planets]]. [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and other planetary bodies have relatively quasi-uniform crusts unlike that of the Earth which contains both oceanic and continental plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albarède|first=Francis|last2=Blichert-Toft|first2=Janne|date=2007-12-19|title=The split fate of the early Earth, Mars, Venus, and Moon|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642761|journal=Geochemistry (Cosmochemistry)|volume=339|issue=14–15|pages=917–927|doi=10.1016/j.crte.2007.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique property reflects the complex series of crustal processes that have taken place throughout the planet's history, including the ongoing process of [[plate tectonics]].

The proposed mechanisms, regarding Earth's crustal evolution, take a theory-orientated approach. Fragmentary geologic evidence and observations provide the basis for hypothetical solutions to problems relating to the early Earth system. Therefore a combination of these theories creates both a framework of current understanding and also a platform for future study.

== Early crust ==

=== Mechanisms of early crust formation ===
The early Earth was entirely molten. This was due to high temperatures created and maintained by the following processes:

The [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] remained hotter than modern day temperatures throughout the [[Archean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-07-01|title=A great thermal divergence in the mantle beginning 2.5 Ga: Geochemical constraints from greenstone basalts and komatiites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116000311|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=543–553|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.01.006|issn=1674-9871|last1=Condie|first1=Kent C.|last2=Aster|first2=Richard C.|last3=Van Hunen|first3=Jeroen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the Earth began to cool as [[planetary accretion]] slowed and heat stored within the [[magma ocean]] was lost to space through [[radiation]].

A theory for the initiation of magma solidification states that once cool enough, the cooler base of the magma ocean would begin to crystallise first.

The composition of the crystals produced during the crystallisation of the magma ocean varied with depth. Experiments involving the melting of [[peridotite]] magma show that deep in the ocean (&gt;≈700m), the main mineral present would be Mg-[[perovskite]]. Whereas [[olivine]] would dominate in the shallower areas along with its high pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s e.g. [[garnet]] and [[majorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-06-15|title=Melting experiments of mantle materials under lower mantle conditions with implications for magma ocean differentiation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920104000718|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=143-144|pages=397–406|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2003.09.016|issn=0031-9201|last1=Ito|first1=E.|last2=Kubo|first2=A.|last3=Katsura|first3=T.|last4=Walter|first4=M.J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing theory to the formation of the first continental crust is through intrusive [[pluton]]ic volcanism.

== Crustal dichotomy ==
Crustal dichotomy represents the distinct contrast in composition and nature of the oceanic and continental plates, which together form the overall crust.

=== Timing ===
Oceanic and continental crusts are, at the present day, produced and maintained through plate tectonic processes. However the same mechanisms are unlikely to have produced the crustal [[dichotomy]] of the early lithosphere. This is thought to be true on the basis that sections of the thin, low density continental lithosphere could not have been sub-ducted under each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequently, a proposed relative timing for crustal dichotomy is put forward stating that dichotomy took place before the commencement of global plate tectonics. This is so a difference in crustal density could be established to facilitate plate subduction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-02-01|title=Crustal evolution of the early earth: The role of major impacts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926880900121|journal=Precambrian Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=3–4|pages=195–216|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(80)90012-1|issn=0301-9268|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert|hdl=2060/19790015389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation ===
[[File:Complex Impact Crater Formation.png|thumb|Development of a the base of an impact crater on the Earth's surface showing infill of basaltic partial melts from mantle. This solidified to form the early differentiated oceanic crust.|317x317px]]
==== Impact cratering ====
Large and numerous impact craters can be recognised on planetary bodies across the Solar System. These craters are thought to date back to a period where there was an increased frequency and intensity of asteroid impacts with terrestrial planets, known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], which terminated approximately 4Ga.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/collections/pjfmznbgbx|title=Bombardment of the early Solar System : Nature Geoscience|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal goes on, claiming the Earth would have also sustained the same relative intensity of cratering as other planetesimals in the [[Solar System]]. It is therefore only due to Earth's high erosional rates and constant plate tectonics that the craters are not visible today. By scaling up the number and size of impact craters seen on the Moon to fit the size of Earth, it is predicted that at least 50% of the Earth's initial crust was covered in impact basins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This estimate provides a lower limit of the effect impact cratering had on the Earth's surface. 

======&lt;small&gt;Effects&lt;/small&gt;======
The main effects of impact cratering on the early lithosphere were:

* Formation of large craters. [[Isostasy|Isostatic rebound]] would adjust the depth of the craters making them relatively shallow in comparison to their diameter;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1977-10-01|title=Origin of the Earth's ocean basins|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103577900641|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=235–250|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(77)90064-1|issn=0019-1035|last1=Frey|first1=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; some reaching 4&amp;nbsp;km deep and 1000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*[[Topography|Topographic]] division between the low-lying impact basins and the now elevated surface.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Release in pressure at the surface from the removal of [[overburden]]. This produced a greater increase in temperature with depth below the surface. Increased surface temperatures caused the [[partial melting]] of mantle which erupted and deposited within the surface basins. The [[pyrolite]] mantle would have produced [[basalt]]ic partial melts, compositionally contrasting to the existing [[sial]]ic crust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magnitude of these impacts is interpreted, with a high level of uncertainty, to have converted roughly half of the 'continental' crust into terrestrial [[Lunar mare|maria]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Stuart Ross|date=1989-04-20|title=Growth of planetary crusts|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195189901510|journal=Tectonophysics|language=en|volume=161|issue=3–4|pages=147–156|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(89)90151-0|issn=0040-1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore providing a method for the formation of crustal dichotomy, as seen today.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Types of crust ==

==== Primordial crust ====
The initial crystallisation of minerals from the [[magma ocean]] formed the primordial crust. 

A potential explanation of this process states the resultant solidification of the mantle edge took place approximately 4.43Ga. This would subsequently produce continents composed of [[komatiite]], an ultramafic rock rich in [[magnesium]] with a high melting point and low [[dynamic viscosity]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nna-Mvondo|first=Delphine|last2=Martinez-Frias|first2=Jesus|date=2007-02-15|title=Review komatiites: from Earth's geological settings to planetary and astrobiological contexts|journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets|language=en|volume=100|issue=3–4|pages=157–179|doi=10.1007/s11038-007-9135-9|issn=0167-9295|hdl=10261/8082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of research follows up on this, proposing that differences in the densities of newly formed crystals caused separation of crustal rocks; upper crust largely composed of fractionated [[gabbro]]s and lower crust composed of [[anorthosite]]s.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Santosh|first1=M.|last2=Arai|first2=T.|last3=Maruyama|first3=S.|date=2017-03-01|title=Hadean Earth and primordial continents: The cradle of prebiotic life|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987116300834|journal=Geoscience Frontiers|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=309–327|doi=10.1016/j.gsf.2016.07.005|issn=1674-9871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result of initial crystallisation formed a primordial crust roughly 60&amp;nbsp;km in depth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The lack of certainty regarding the formation of primordial crust is due to there being no remaining present day examples. This is due to Earth's high erosional rates and the [[subduction]] and subsequent destruction of tectonic plates throughout its 4.5 Ga history.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, during its existence the primordial crust is thought to have been regularly broken and re-formed by impacts involving other planetesimals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This continued for several hundred million years after [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], which concluded approximately 4.4Ga.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The outcome of this would be the constant alteration in the composition of the primordial crust, increasing the difficulty in determining its nature.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

==== Secondary crust ====
Recycling of existing primordial crust contributes to the production of secondary crust. Partial melting of the existing crust increases the [[mafic]] content of the melt producing basaltic secondary crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8OM3NDrttsC&amp;pg=PA484&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=secondary+crust#v=onepage&amp;q=secondary%20crust&amp;f=false|title=Earth as an Evolving Planetary System|last=Condie|first=Kent C.|date=2011-08-25|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123852274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further method of formation due to the decay of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] elements within the Earth releasing heat energy and eventually causing the partial melting of upper mantle, also producing basaltic lavas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RtC-nQEACAAJ|title=The Continental Crust: Its Composition and Evolution|last=Taylor|first=Stuart Ross|date=1985|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, most secondary crust on Earth is formed at [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid ocean ridges]] forming the oceanic crust.

==== Tertiary crust ====
The present day continental crust is an example of a tertiary crust. Tertiary crust is the most differentiated type of crust and so has a composition vastly different to that of the bulk Earth.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S. R.|last2=McLennan|first2=S. M.|date=1985-01-01|title=The continental crust: Its composition and evolution|language=English|osti=6582885}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tertiary crust contains over 20% of the abundance of [[incompatible element]]s, which are elements a size or charge that prevent them from being included in mineral structure.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This a result of its generation from the subduction and partial melting of secondary crust where it undergoes further [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallisation]]. Two stages of evolution produce an increased proportion of incompatible elements.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Initiation of plate tectonics ==
[[File:Plumeinducedsubduction.png|thumb|357x357px|A schematic evolutionary diagram showing the impact of a mantle plume on the early lithosphere (dark blue) and surface proto-crust (brown). This initiated subduction and subsequent global plate tectonics within a previously unseparated lithosphere that had no lateral surface movement.Modified from &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-12-01|title=Subduction initiation by thermal–chemical plumes: Numerical studies|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920108001581|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=171|issue=1-4|pages=296–312|doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2008.06.032|issn=0031-9201}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Plume induced subduction ===
The formation and development of [[Mantle plume|plumes]] in the early mantle contributed to triggering the lateral movement of crust across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kröner|first=A.|last2=Layer|first2=P. W.|date=1992-06-05|title=Crust Formation and Plate Motion in the Early Archean|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5062/1405|journal=Science|language=en|volume=256|issue=5062|pages=1405–1411|doi=10.1126/science.256.5062.1405|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17791608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of upwelling mantle plumes on the lithosphere can be seen today through local depressions around [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] such as [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]. The scale of this impact is much less than that exhibited in the Archean eon where mantle temperatures were much greater. Localised areas of hot mantle rose to the surface through a central plume wedge, weakening the damaged and already thin lithosphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once the plume head breaks the surface, crust either side of the head is forced downwards through the conservation of mass, initiating subduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Late Cretaceous plume-induced subduction initiation along the southern margin of the Caribbean and NW South America: The first documented example with implications for the onset of plate tectonics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1342937X14002391|journal=Gondwana Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=38–63|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.07.011|issn=1342-937X|last1=Whattam|first1=Scott A.|last2=Stern|first2=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical modelling shows only strongly energetic plumes are capable of weakening the lithosphere enough to rupture it, such plumes would have been present in the hot Archean mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerya|first=T.

Pre-tectonic subduction can also be inferred from the internal volcanism on Venus. [[Artemis Corona]] is a large plume formed by the upwelling of mantle derived magma and is on a scale potentially comparable to that in the [[Archean]] mantle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Models using its known characteristics showed that continued magmatism from [[Thermal conduction|conductive]] heat through the plume caused gravitational collapse. The weight of collapse caused the spreading of the surrounding crust outwards and subsequent subduction around the margins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Kranendonk|first=Martin J|date=2010|title=Two types of Archean continental crust: Plume and plate tectonics on early Earth|url=http://www.ajsonline.org/content/310/10/1187.full.pdf+html|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=310|pages=1187–1209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anhydrous]] nature of the crust on Venus prevents it from sliding past each other, whereas through the study of oxygen isotopes, the presence of water on Earth can be confirmed from 4.3Ga.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-07-15|title=Magmatic δ18O in 4400–3900 Ma detrital zircons: A record of the alteration and recycling of crust in the Early Archean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05002773|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|language=en|volume=235|issue=3–4|pages=663–681|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2005.04.028|issn=0012-821X|last1=Cavosie|first1=A.J.|last2=Valley|first2=J.W.|last3=Wilde|first3=S.A.|last4=e.i.m.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this model helps provide a mechanism for how plate tectonics could have been triggered on Earth, although it does not demonstrate that subduction was initiated at the earliest confirmed presence of water on Earth. Based on these models, the onset of subduction and plate tectonics is dated at 3.6Ga.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Late Heavy Bombardment ===
Impact cratering also had consequences for both the development of plume-induced subduction and the establishment of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The steepening of geothermal gradients could have directly enhanced convective mantle transport which now beneath an increasingly fractured lithosphere could have created stresses great enough to cause rifting and the separation of crust into plates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Crustal growth rates ==
[[File:Growthcurve.png|thumb|331x331px|Plots showing the rate of continental crustal growth over time as a percentage of the total mass, along with associated thickness of the newly generated crust. The plot of crustal reworking represents the amount of post formational alteration undergone by the crust. The dramatic increase in crustal reworking and reduction in the rate of crustal growth at approximately 3.6Ga represents the onset of subduction and plate tectonics. Modified from &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;]]

=== Lithological dating ===
Crustal growth rates can be used to calculate estimates for the age of the continental crust. This can be done through analysis of [[igneous rock]]s with the same [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition as initial mantle rock. These igneous rocks are dated and assumed to be direct evidence of new continental crust formation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resulting ages of isotopically juvenile igneous rocks give distinct peaks, representing an increased proportion of igneous rock and therefore increased crust growth, at 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga. The validity of these results is questioned as the peaks could represent periods of preservation rather than increased continental crust generation. This is reinforced by the fact that such peaks are not observed in recent geologic time where it is given that [[magmatism]] resulting from the plate subduction has strongly contributed to producing new crust.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=C. J.|last2=Kemp|first2=A. I. S.|date=2006-10-19|title=Evolution of the continental crust|journal=Nature|volume=443|issue=7113|pages=811–817|doi=10.1038/nature05191|issn=1476-4687|pmid=17051208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustal growth rates from igneous rocks can be compared to the rates generated from [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic]] isotope ratios in sedimentary rocks. Projections of growth rates using these techniques does not produce staggered peaks, instead smooth shallow curves presenting a more constant rate of crustal growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although representative of large periods of time, limitations are found where samples do not solely represent magmatic production events. Instead samples include the mixing of sediments which produces a mix of original and altered isotope ratios.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zircon dating ===
[[Zircon]] minerals can be both [[Detritus (geology)|detrital]] grains from sedimentary rocks and crystals in igneous rocks. Therefore, a combination of zircon forms can provide a more accurate estimate of crustal growth rates. Further to this, zircon minerals can be subject to [[Hafnium|Hf]] and [[Oxygen|O]] isotope ratio analysis.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is important as Hf isotopes indicate whether a rock originates from the mantle or an existing rock. High δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of zircons represent rock recycled at the Earth's surface and thus potentially producing mixed samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condie|first=K. C.|date=2014-06|title=Growth of continental crust: a balance between preservation and recycling|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/minmag/article/78/3/623/85695/growth-of-continental-crust-a-balance-between|journal=Mineralogical Magazine|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=623–637|doi=10.1180/minmag.2014.078.3.11|issn=0026-461X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this combined analysis is valid zircons showing periods of increased crustal generation at at 1.9 and 3.3Ga, the latter of which representing the time period following the commencement of global plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Earth-centered religion or [[nature worship]] is a system of religion based on the veneration of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406588/nature-worship Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers any [[religion]] that [[worship]]s the [[earth]], [[nature]], or [[fertility deity]], such as the various forms of [[Mother Goddess|goddess worship]] or [[matriarchal religion]]. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
[[File:Annarbor tree.jpg|thumb]]

===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Old Europe (archaeology)|pre-Indo-European]] societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced [[matrilineal succession]] and goddess-centered religion&lt;ref name="From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2002 |last=French |first=Marilyn |title=From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Slavic+matrilinear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iftdUb2HOoq-8AToy4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Slavic%20matrilinear&amp;f=false |publisher=McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In [[Irish mythology]] she is [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], in [[Slavic mythology]] she is [[Mat Zemlya]], and in other cultures she is [[Pachamama]], [[Ninsun]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], [[Nüwa]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matres]] or [[Shakti]].

In the late 1800s, [[James Weir (1856-1906)|James Weir]] wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the [[nature worship|worship of nature]] formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.&lt;ref name="Lust and Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=James|title=Lust and Religion|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26071/26071-h/26071-h.htm|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|format=EBook|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]] have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, ''The Urantia Book'',  another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2" /&gt;  His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright Morning Star|title=The Urantia Book|year=2005|publisher=Uversa Press|location=New York|isbn=0965197220|pages=805–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MfMsljJW3gC&amp;pg=PA806&amp;lpg=PA806&amp;dq=%22The+objects+of+worship+were+altogether+suggestive;+they+consisted+of+the+things+of+nature+which+were+close+at+hand,+or+which+loomed+large+in+the+commonplace+experience+of+the+simple-minded+primitive+Urantians%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IqLZ2C00XB&amp;sig=b8eFU33wB5hl6ekR_BZSjG3rpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5ZIUZiOLsWTyQHrnoCQBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20objects%20of%20worship%20were%20altogether%20suggestive%3B%20they%20consisted%20of%20the%20things%20of%20nature%20which%20were%20close%20at%20hand%2C%20or%20which%20loomed%20large%20in%20the%20commonplace%20experience%20of%20the%20simple-minded%20primitive%20Urantians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.

===Origins of religion===
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. [[Pascal Boyer]] suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a "blank slate."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained|year=2001|publisher=A Member of the Perseus Book club|location=New Work|isbn=0465006965|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that "having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Barbara J.|title=Evolving God: A Provocative View of the Origins of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday Religion|location=New York|isbn=0385521553}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Mar 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of [[belongingness]], which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;  This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the [[hominidae|hominid]] (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that "an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

==Encompassed religions==
The term ''earth religion'' encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as [[paganism]], which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; [[animism]], which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; [[Wicca]], who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and [[druidism]], which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is [[pantheism]], which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that "all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part" and "we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WPM Statement of Principles|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheism|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom "consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimoń|first=Henryk|title=The Sacredness of the Earth Among the Konkomba of Northern Ghana|journal=Anthropos|year=2003|volume=98|issue=2|pages=421–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Konkomba]] of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as [[Peyote Religion]], [[Longhouse Religion]], and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as [[International Mother Earth Day]] by the [[United Nations]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10823.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Proclaims 22 April 'International Mother Earth Day' Adopting By Consensus Bolivia-Led Resolution |publisher=United Nations |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. [[Winter solstice]] and [[Summer solstice]] are celebrated with holidays like [[Yule]] and [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongzhi]] in the winter and [[Tiregān]] and [[Kupala]] in the summer.

===Africa===
[[Animism]] is practiced among the [[Bantu peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rGpO_TzeCsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=nature+worship+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XENeUaTVH4ym9gT0uIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nature%20worship%20animism&amp;f=false |title=African Traditional Religion in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography p 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Dahomey mythology]] has deities like [[Nana Buluku]], [[Gleti]], [[Mawu]],     [[Asase Yaa]], [[Naa Nyonmo]] and [[Xevioso]].

===Europe===
In [[Baltic mythology]], the sun is a female deity, [[Saulė|Saule]], a mother or a bride, and [[Mēness]] is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In [[Slavic mythology]] [[Mokosh]] and [[Mat Zemlya]] together with [[Perun]] head up the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. [[Dragobete]] is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] spring holiday that celebrates "the day when the birds are betrothed."

===India===
In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[yoni]] is the creative power of nature and the [[origin of life]]. In [[Shaktism]], the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. ''[[The X-Files]]'' was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air [[witchcraft]] and [[Wicca]] (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little "sensationalistic". That same year, the movie ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as ''The X-Files'' had been.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Juggler|url=http://culture.pagannewswirecollective.com/2010/08/a-time-line-of-wiccan-pop-culture/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' - became widely popular. Although ''Charmed'' focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, ''Buffy'' was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on [[Vampire|vampires]], the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"/&gt;

Other movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s most well known films - ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=krasskova|title=My Top 10 Pagan/Heathen Movies|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/11/my-top-10-paganheathen-movies/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]''. Those who practice Earth Religion view ''The Lion King'' as an Earth Religion film mainly for the "interconnectedness" and "Circle of Life" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, ''Brother Bear'' portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

Other earth religion movies include ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', ''[[The Deceivers (film)]]'', ''[[Sorceress (1982 film)]]'', ''[[Anchoress (film)]]'', ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', ''[[Agora (film)]]'', and ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)]]''. These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[File:Emirgan 04589.jpg|thumb]]

===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of "Mother Earth" is that the rights of nature and [[ecocide]] movements are inhibitors of human progress and development.&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley|title=Ecocide is Earth Religion|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/322526/ecocide-earth-religion|work=Human Exceptionalism|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “[[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] with the potential to do real harm to the human family.”&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"/&gt; According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
A lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is believed to be "too preoccupied with awakening magical powers"&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Herman|title=Earth Religion News|journal=geraldgardner.com|year=1976|volume=I|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/Earth_Religion_News.php|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to [[George Pickingill|"Old George" Pickingill]], who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and "England’s most notorious Witch".&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

Crowley himself was "allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert."&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt; He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being "punished" by women.&lt;ref name="The Great Beast: Aleister Crowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symonds|first=John|title=The Great Beast|year=1952|publisher=Roy|isbn=0356036316|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, [[Witchcraft]], a common practice of [[Wicca]]ns, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism.&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Wicca?|url=http://www.thecircleofthesacredwell.org/more_info/what_is_wicca.htm|work=An Eclectic Neopagan Circle|publisher=The Circle of the Sacred Well|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Wicca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: a Neopagan, Earth-centered religion|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm|work=Religioustolerance.org|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca "have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc."&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"/&gt;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism.&lt;ref name="Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/introductory/neo-pagan_satanism.php|work=Confusions and Distinctions|publisher=The Pagan Library|accessdate=20 March 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.&lt;ref name="Is Satanism Pagan?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vera|first=Diane|title=Is Satanism "Pagan"?|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/pagan/Is-Satanism-Pagan.html|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of Satanism as Religious Harassment====
Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as "other" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the "other" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as [[Samhain]]. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or "the adversary", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the "other" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of ''earth religion'' there is no consensus of beliefs.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede" /&gt;  However, the [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt; These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.

===The Wiccan Rede===
"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will."&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Commonly worded in modern English as "if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piper|first=David|title=Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wiccan_ethics_rede.php|publisher=paganlibrary.com|accessdate=15 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought"&gt;{{cite web|last=McColman|first=Carl|title=Principles of Moral Thought and Action|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/Principles-of-Moral-Thought-and-Action.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiccan Statement of Principles" /&gt;   The [[Wiccan Rede|rede]] clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All About You" /&gt;  Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into "Do what ye will an it harm none," meaning "Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the "harmlessness" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a [[karma]] reaction from every action.&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lark|title=Beyond The Wiccan Rede - Other Pagan Ethics|url=http://realpagan.net/forum/topics/beyond-the-wiccan-rede-other|publisher=realpagan.net|accessdate=15 Mar 2013|date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Threefold Law===
[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|The Threefold Law]] is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.&lt;ref name=Threefold&gt;{{cite web|last=Wren|title=The Law of Three|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=basics&amp;id=2872|publisher=witchvox.com|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|date=16 Jul 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor===

An '''earth structure''' is a building or other structure made largely from [[soil]]. Since soil is a widely available material, it has been used in construction since prehistoric times.
It may be combined with other materials, compressed and/or baked to add strength. 
Soil is still an economical material for many applications, and may have low environmental impact both during and after construction.

Earth structure materials may be as simple as [[mud]], or mud mixed with straw to make [[Cob (material)|cob]]. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from [[sod]] or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be compacted into [[rammed earth]]. Construction is faster with pre-formed [[adobe]] or [[mudbrick]]s, [[compressed earth block]]s, [[Earthbag construction|earthbag]]s or [[brick|fired clay brick]]s.{{efn|Fired bricks and concrete are derived from earth, but structures built from these materials are usually not considered earth structures.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}} }}

Types of earth structure include [[earth sheltering|earth shelters]], where a dwelling is wholly or partly embedded in the ground or encased in soil. Native American [[earth lodge]]s are examples. [[Wattle and daub]] houses use a "wattle" of  poles interwoven with sticks to provide stability for mud walls. [[Sod house]]s were built on the northwest coast of Europe, and later by European settlers on the North American prairies. Adobe or mud-brick buildings are built around the world and include houses, apartment buildings, mosques and churches. [[Fujian Tulou]]s are large fortified rammed earth buildings in southeastern China that shelter as many as 80 families. Other types of earth structure include mounds and pyramids used for religious purposes, [[levee]]s, [[mechanically stabilized earth]] retaining walls, forts, trenches and [[embankment dam]]s.

==Soil==
[[File:SoilTexture USDA.png|thumb|[[Soil type]]s by clay, silt and sand composition as used by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]]]
Soil is created from rock that has been chemically or physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated.{{sfn|USDA|1974|p=112-113}}
Soil particles include [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]].  Sand particles are the largest at {{convert|2|to|0.05|mm}} in diameter and clay the smallest at less than {{convert|0.002|mm}} in diameter.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}
Both sand and silt are mostly inert rock particles, including  [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[feldspar]] and [[mica]].{{sfn|Shah|Shroff|2003|p=22}}

Clays typically are [[phyllosilicate]] minerals with a sheet-like structure.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}
The very small clay particles interact with each other physically and chemically. 
Even a small proportion of clay affects the physical properties of the soil much more than might be expected.{{sfn|Shah|Shroff|2003|p=22}}
Clays such as [[kaolinite]] do not expand or contract when wetted or dried, and are useful for brick-making. 
Others, such as [[smectite]]s, expand or contract considerably when wet or dry, and are not suitable for building.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}

[[Loam]] is a mix of sand, silt and clay in which none predominates. 
Soils are given different names depending on the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay such as "Silt Loam", "Clay Loam" and "Silty Clay".{{sfn|Ball|Norton|2002|p=219}}
Loam construction, the subject of this article, referred to as adobe construction when it uses unfired clay bricks, is an ancient building technology. It was used in the early civilizations of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], in the [[Indus]], [[Ganges]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] river valleys, in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. 
As of 2005 about 1.5 billion people lived in houses built of loam.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=1}}{{efn|One source estimates that as many as three billion people live in earth buildings.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}} }}

In recent years, interest in loam construction has revived in the developed world. It is seen as a way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, and to create a comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}}
The two main technologies are stamped or rammed earth, clay or loam, called ''pise de terre'' in French, and [[adobe]], typically using sun-dried bricks made of a mud and straw mixture.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}}{{efn|The word "adobe" is derived from the ancient Egyptian "tob", meaning "brick". The Arabs adopted the word as "at-tub" or "attuba", and the Spanish made this "adobe".{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}} }}

[[File:Mud houses are commonly found in various regions of Afghanistan..jpg|thumb|Mud houses in [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan]]
Earth usually requires some sort of processing for use in construction. It may be combined with water to make [[mud]], straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement may be used to harden the earth, and the earth may be compacted to increase strength.{{Sfn|Watson|1993|p=290}}

===Mud===

Coursed mud construction is one of the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.{{sfn|Cornerstones Community Partnerships|2006|p=72}}
In Iran, puddled mud walls are called ''chine'' construction. Each course is about {{convert|18|to|24|in}} thick, and about {{convert|18|to|24|in}} high. Typically the technique is used for garden walls but not for house construction, presumably because of concern about the strength of walls made in this way.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=110}}
A drawback to the approach is that a lot of time can be spent waiting for each course to dry.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}}
Another technique, used in areas where wood is plentiful, is to build a wood frame house and to infill it with mud, primarily to provide insulation. In parts of England a similar technique was used with cob.{{sfn|Cornerstones Community Partnerships|2006|p=72}}

===Cob===
[[File:Cob wall in Harwell - geograph.org.uk - 1483279.jpg|thumb|Cob wall in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], England, hundreds of years old, thatched to protect it from water]]
[[Cob (material)|Cob]], sometimes referred to as "monolithic adobe",{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} is a [[natural building]] material made from soil that includes clay, sand or small stones and an organic material such as [[straw]]. Cob walls are usually built up in courses, have no mortar joints and need 30% or more clay in the soil. Cob can be used as in-fill in post-and-beam buildings, but is often used for load bearing walls, and can bear up to two stories.  A cob wall should be at least {{convert|16|in}} thick, and the ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten.{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} It will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime, soil and sand. Cob is fireproof, and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures.{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} 
Tests have shown that cob has some resistance to seismic activity. However, building codes in the developed world may not recognize cob as an approved material.{{sfn|Goodnow|2007}}

===Sod or turf===
[[File:Sod House Detail (4245555122).jpg|thumb|Sod bricks in a house wall]]
Cut [[sod]] bricks, called ''terrone'' in Spanish, can be used to make tough and durable walls. The sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots, which may be found in river bottom lands. It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}}
European settlers on the North American Prairies found that the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs.{{sfn|Rollings-Magnusson|2012|p=28}} Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses may still be found. A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.{{sfn|Berge|2009|p=232}}
The Icelanders find that the best quality turf is the ''Strengur'', the top {{convert|5|cm}} of the grass turf.{{sfn|Berge|2009|p=233}}

===Stabilized earth===

Clay is usually hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, but if the wall is directly exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it may become saturated and collapse.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=4}}
Earth may be "stabilized" to make it more weather resistant. The practice of stabilizing earth by adding burnt lime is centuries old.{{sfn|Teter|Liu|Kent|1964|p=1}}
[[Portland cement]] or [[bitumen]] may also be added to earth intended for construction which adds strength, although the stabilized earth is not as strong as fired clay or concrete.{{sfn|Teter|Liu|Kent|1964|p=1}} Mixtures of cement and lime, or [[pozzolana]] and lime, may also be used for stabilization.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=5}}

Preferably the sand content of the soil will be 65% – 75%. Soils with low clay content, or with no more than 15% non-expansive clay, are suitable for stabilized earth.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=6}} The clay percentage may be reduced by adding sand, if available.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=8}}
If there is more than 15% clay it may take more than 10% cement to stabilize the soil, which adds to the cost.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=6}}
If earth contains little clay and holds 10% or more cement, it is in effect concrete.
Cement is not particularly environmentally friendly, since the manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}
Low-density stabilized earth will be porous and weak. The earth must therefore be compacted either by a machine that makes blocks or within the wall using the "rammed earth" technique.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=5}}

===Rammed earth===
[[File:Alte Schule Bonbaden 1.jpg|thumb|Old school built of rammed earth in 1836–37 in [[Bonbaden]], Hesse, Germany ]]
Rammed earth is a technique for building walls using natural raw materials such as earth, [[chalk]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] or [[gravel]].
A rammed earth wall is built by placing damp soil in a temporary form. The soil is manually or mechanically compacted and then the form is removed.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1966}}
Rammed earth is generally made without much water, and so does not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}

In China, rammed earth walls were built by the [[Longshan culture|Longshan people]] in 2600–1900 BC, during the period when cities first appeared in the region. Thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as [[Sikkim]].{{sfn|Outlook|2008|p=38}} The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of [[Carthage]] was built of rammed earth. From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=17}}
Rammed earth structures may be long lasting. Most of the [[Great Wall of China]] was made from rammed earth, as was the [[Alhambra]] in the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. In Northern Europe there are rammed earth buildings up to seven stories high and two hundred years old.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}

===Concrete===

The Romans made durable concrete strong enough for load-bearing walls.{{sfn|Snell|2004|pp=27-28}} Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and ''pozzolana'', a volcanic material that contributed significantly to its strength.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=3}} Roman concrete structures such as the [[Colosseum]], completed in 80 AD, still stand.{{sfn|Snell|2004|p=28}}
Their longevity may be explained by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.{{sfn|Snell|2004|p=29}} Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}}

==Building units==

===Mud brick or adobe brick===
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], Kyrgyzstan]]
[[File:Working mudbrick press 5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Making mudbricks near [[Cooktown, Australia]]]]
{{Main|Mudbrick|Adobe}}
Mudbricks or Adobe bricks are preformed modular masonry units of sun-dried mud that were invented at different times in different parts of the world as civilization developed.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=3}} Construction with bricks avoids the delays while each course of puddled mud dries. Wall murals show that adobe production techniques were highly advanced in Egypt by 2500 BC.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}} 
Adobe construction is common throughout much of Africa today.{{Sfn|Elleh|1998|p=47}} 
Adobe bricks are traditionally made from sand and clay mixed with water to a plastic consistency, with straw or grass as a binder.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}}{{efn|The straw and grass in adobe does not make the brick any stronger in the long term, but helps ensure that the bricks shrink uniformly as they dry.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}} }}
The mud is prepared, placed in wooden forms, tamped and leveled, and then turned out of the mold to dry for several days. 
The bricks are then stood on end to air-cure for a month or more.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}}

In the southwest United States and Mexico adobe buildings had massive walls and were rarely more than two stories high. 
Adobe mission churches were never more than about {{convert|35|ft}}.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=50}}
Since adobe surfaces are fragile, coatings are used to protect them. 
These coatings, periodically renewed, have included mud plaster, lime plaster, whitewash{{efn|Whitewash, made of ground [[gypsum]] mixed with water and clay, has been used to protect earth walls since ancient times.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=51}} }} or stucco.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=51}}
Adobe walls were historically made by laying the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks at the same rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=50}}

===Compressed earth block===
[[File:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|[[Compressed earth block]] housing being built in [[Midland, Texas]] in 2006]]
[[Compressed earth block]]s (CEB) were traditionally made by using a stick to ram soil into a wooden mold. Today they are usually made from subsoil compressed in a hand-operated or powered machine. In the developing world, manual machines can be a cost-effective solution for making uniform building blocks, while the more complex and expensive motorized machines are less likely to be appropriate. 
Although labor-intensive, CEB construction avoids the cost of buying and transporting materials.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=138}}
Block-making machines may form blocks that have interlocking shapes to reduce the requirement for mortar.
The block may have holes or grooves so rods such as bamboo can be inserted to improve earthquake resistance.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=139}}

Suitable earth must be used, with enough clay to hold the block together and resist erosion, but not too much expansive clay.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=140}}
When the block has been made from stabilized earth, which contains cement, the concrete must be given perhaps three weeks to cure.
During this time the blocks should be stacked and kept from drying out by sprinkling water over them. 
This may be a problem in hot, dry climates where water is scarce.
Closely stacking the blocks and covering them with a polythene sheet may help reduce water loss.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=24}}

===Earthbags===

[[Earthbag construction]] is a [[natural building]] technique that has evolved from historic military construction techniques for [[bunker]]s.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
Local subsoil of almost any composition can be used, although an adobe mix would be preferable.
The soil is moistened so it will compact into a stable structure when packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. Polypropylene (pp) sacks are most common, since they are durable when covered, cheap, and widely available.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
The bags are laid in courses, with barbed wire between each course to prevent slipping. Each course is tamped after it is laid.{{sfn|Calkins|2008|p=162}}
The structure in pp bags is similar to adobe but more flexible. With mesh tubing the structure is like rammed earth.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
Earthbags may be used to make dome-shaped or vertical wall buildings. With soil stabilization they may also be used for retaining walls.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=152}}

===Fired clay brick===
[[File:English Bond - geograph.org.uk - 702506.jpg|thumb|English bond bricks from 1454 at the Old College in [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire, England]]
The technique of firing clay [[brick]]s in a kiln dates to about 3500 BC. 
Fired bricks were being used to build durable masonry across Europe, Asia and North Africa by 1200 BC and still remain an important building material.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=163}} Modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales, shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8–12 hours at a temperature of 900–1150&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}}{{efn|Yellow [[Dutch brick]]s were made from clay or mud dredged from the [[IJssel]] and other rivers, which was molded and burned in peat-fired kilns for three or four weeks. The bricks were then given about three weeks to cool before being removed.{{sfn|Manufacture of Brick – Yellow Dutch Brick 1840|p=290}} 
Modern processes use higher temperatures and much shorter firing times.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}} }}
The result is a [[ceramic]] that is mainly composed of silica and alumina, with other ingredients such as quartz sand. The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration. The bricks may vary in color depending on the amount of iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used, and the amount of oxygen in the kiln.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}}
Bricks may decay due to crystallization of salts on the brick or in its pores, from frost action and from acidic gases.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=166}}

Bricks are laid in courses bonded with mortar, a combination of Portland cement, lime and sand.{{sfn|Kreh|1997|p=72}}
A wall that is two bricks thick will include stretcher bricks with their long, narrow side exposed and header bricks crossing from side to side. 
There are various [[brickwork]] "bonds", or patterns of stretchers and headers, including the English, Dutch and Flemish bonds.{{sfn|Lloyd|1929|p=81}}

==Examples==

===Earth sheltering===
[[File:Iceland Keldur Earth covered homes.JPG|thumb|[[Icelandic turf house|Turf houses]] in [[Keldur]], [[Iceland]], an example of [[Earth sheltering]]]]
[[Earth sheltering]] has been used for thousands of years to make energy-efficient dwellings.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=3}}
There are various configurations. At one extreme, an earth sheltered dwelling is completely underground, with perhaps an open courtyard to provide air and light. 
An [[earth house]] may be set into a slope, with windows or door openings in one or more of its sides, or the building may be on ground level, but with earth mounded against the walls, and perhaps with an earth roof.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=8}}

Pit houses made by [[Hohokam]] farmers between 100 and 900 AD, in what is now the southwest of the US, were bermed structures, partially embedded in south-facing slopes. Their successful design was used for hundreds of years.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=2}}
At [[Matmata, Tunisia]], most of the ancient homes were built {{convert|12|m}} below ground level, and surrounded courtyards about {{convert|12|m}} square.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=4}}{{efn|The opening scenes of ''[[Star Wars]]'' were shot in the Hotel Sidi Driss in [[Matmata, Tunisia]], an earth sheltered dwelling around a deeply sunken courtyard.{{sfn|Robb|2012|p=33}} }}
The homes were reached through tunnels. Other examples of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both hot and cold climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=4}} A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=3}} By setting an earth house into the ground, the house will be cooler in the warm season and warmer in the cool season.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=8}}

===Native American earth lodge===

An [[earth lodge]] is a circular building made by some of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of North America. 
They have wood post and beam construction and are dome-shaped.{{sfn|Earth Lodge, Random House}}
A typical structure would have four or more central posts planted in the ground and connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.{{sfn|Nabokov|1989|p=126}}
The structure was covered by sticks and brush or grass, covered in turn by a heavy layer of earth or [[sod]].
Some groups plastered the whole structure with mud, which dried to form a shell.{{sfn|Nabokov|1989|p=126}}
[[File:School in a Maasai village on the A109 road, Kenya.jpg|thumb|School in a [[Maasai people|Maasai]] village on the A109 road, Kenya]]

===Wattle and daub===
[[Wattle and daub]] is an old building technique in which vines or smaller sticks are interwoven between upright poles, and then mud mixed with straw and grass is plastered over the wall.{{sfn|Young|Fowler|2000|p=46}}
The technique is found around the world, from the Nile Delta to Japan, where bamboo was used to make the wattle.{{sfn|Racusin|McArleton|2012|p=252}}
In [[Cahokia]], now in Illinois, USA, wattle and daub houses were built with the floor lowered by {{convert|1|to|3|ft}} below the ground. 
A variant of the technique is called ''bajareque'' in [[Colombia]].{{sfn|Young|Fowler|2000|p=46}}
In prehistoric Britain simple circular wattle and daub shelters were built wherever adequate clay was available.{{sfn|Sunshine|2006|p=5}}
Wattle and daub is still found as the panels in timber-framed buildings.{{sfn|Sunshine|2006|p=Back cover}} Generally the walls are not structural, and in interior use the technique in the developed world was replaced by lath and plaster, and then by [[gypsum wallboard]].{{sfn|Racusin|McArleton|2012|p=252}}

===Prairie sod house===
[[File:Omer Kem's sod house.jpg|thumb|[[Omer Madison Kem]], (later, Representative to the United States Congress) in front of his sod house in Nebraska (1886)]]
European pioneer farmers in the prairies of North America, where there is no wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a covering over the entrance. When they had time, they would build a [[sod house]]. The farmer would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks {{convert|1|by|2|ft}}, which were then piled up to form the walls.{{sfn|White|1991|p=228}}
The sod strips were piled grass-side down, staggered in the same way as brickwork, in three side-by-side rows, resulting in a wall over {{convert|3|ft}} thick. The sod wall was built around door and window frames, and the corners of the wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them. The roof was made with poles or brush, covered with prairie grass, and then sealed with a layer of sod.{{sfn|Porterfield|2004|p=39}}
Sod houses were strong and often lasted many years, but they were damp and dirty unless the interior walls were plastered.{{sfn|White|1991|p=228}}
The roofs tended to leak, and sometimes collapsed in a rainstorm.{{sfn|Porterfield|2004|p=39}}

===Mud brick buildings===

There are innumerable examples of mud brick or adobe building around the world. The walled city of [[Shibam]] in Yemen, designated a World Heritage Site in 1982, is known fr its ten-story unreinforced mud-brick buildings.{{sfn|Jerome|2006|p=144}}
The [[Djinguereber Mosque]] of [[Timbuktu]], Mali, was first built at the start of the 14th century AD (8th century AH) from round mud bricks and a stone-mud misture, and was rebuilt several times afterwards, steadily growing in size.{{sfn|Sliwoski|2007|p=70}}
Further south in Mali, the [[Great Mosque of Djenné|Great Mosque]] of [[Djenné]], a dramatic example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. was built in 1907, based on the design of an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280. Mudbrick requires maintenance, and the fundamentalist ruler [[Seku Amadu]] had let the previous mosque collapse.{{sfn|Ham|2009|p=498}}

The [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], now a national monument in Arizona protected by a modern roof, is a massive four-story adobe structure built by Hohokam people between 1200 and 1450 AD.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=13}}
The first European to record the great house was a Jesuit priest, Father [[Eusebio Kino]], who visited the site in 1694. 
At that time it had long been abandoned.{{sfn|Houk|1996|p=6}}
By the time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 the adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years.{{sfn|Houk|1996|p=9}}

[[Huaca de la Luna]] in what is now northern Peru is a large adobe temple built by the [[Moche culture|Moche people]]. The building went through a series of construction phases, growing eventually to a height of about {{convert|32|m}}, with three main platforms, four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures. The walls were covered by striking multi-colored murals and friezes; those visible today date from about 400–610 AD.{{sfn|Jackson|2008|p=22}}

===Toulous===
[[File:Snail pit tulou.jpg|thumb|[[Tianluokeng Tulou cluster]] in [[Fujian]] province, China]]
A [[Fujian Tulou]] is a type of rural dwelling of the [[Hakka people]] in the mountainous areas in southeastern [[Fujian]], China.{{sfn|Needham|1971|pp=133–134}}
They were mostly built between the 13th and the 20th centuries.{{sfn|Fujian Tulou, UNESCO}} 
A tulou is a large, enclosed and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, with very thick load-bearing [[rammed earth]] walls between three and five stories high.
A toulou might house up to 80 families. Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls, storehouses, wells and living areas.
The structure resembles a small fortified city.{{sfn|Earthen Houses (Tulou), Fujian Province}}
The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, and are to {{convert|6|ft}} thick. 
The result is a well-lit, well-ventilated, windproof and earthquake-proof building that is warm in winter and cool in summer.{{sfn|Earthen Houses (Tulou), Fujian Province}}

===Mounds and pyramids===
[[File:Ancient ziggurat at Ali Air Base Iraq 2005.jpg|thumb|Ziggurat at [[Ali Air Base]] in Iraq]]
[[Ziggurat]]s were elevated temples constructed by the [[Sumer]]ians between the end of the 4th millennium BC and the 2nd millennium BC, rising in a series of terraces to a temple up to {{convert|200|ft}} above ground level. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]] contained about three million bricks, none more than {{convert|15|in}} in length, so construction would have been a huge project.{{sfn|Forrest|1969|p=6}}
The largest ziggurat was in Babylon, and is thought by some to be the [[Tower of Babel]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. It was destroyed by [[Alexander the Great]] and only the foundations remain, but originally it stood {{convert|300|ft}} high on a base about {{convert|660|ft}} square.{{sfn|Faiella|2005|p=17}}
Sun-dried bricks were used for the interior and kiln-fired bricks for the facing. 
The bricks were held together by clay or bitumen.{{sfn|Faiella|2005|p=18}}

Many pre-Columbian Native American societies of ancient North America built large [[pyramid]]al earth structures known as [[platform mound]]s. Among the largest and best-known of these structures is [[Monks Mound]] at the site of [[Cahokia]] in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have played a central role in the mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public [[Tribal chief|chief]]'s house platforms, public [[temple]] platforms, [[mortuary]] platforms, [[charnel house]] platforms, [[earth lodge]]/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.{{sfn|Lindauer|Blitz|1997|p=169ff}}{{sfn|Fogelson|2004|p=741}}

The {{convert|207|ft}} [[Pyramid of the Sun]] in [[Teotihuacan]], Mexico, was started in 100 AD. 
The stone-faced structure contains two million tons of rammed earth.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=17}}

===Earthworks===
[[File:Retaining wall, Ramsden Wood Road - geograph.org.uk - 1268429.jpg|thumb|Retaining wall near [[Todmorden]], West Yorkshire, England]]
[[Earthworks (engineering)|Earthworks]] are engineering works created through moving or processing quantities of soil or unformed rock. 
The material may be moved to another location and formed into a desired shape for a purpose.{{sfn|Merritt|Loftin|Ricketts|1995|p=13.1}}
[[Levee]]s, embankments and dams are types of earthwork.
A levee, floodbank or stopbank is an elongated natural ridge or artificially constructed [[fill dirt|dirt fill]] wall that regulates water levels. It is usually earthen and often runs parallel to the course of a river in its [[floodplain]] or along low-lying coastlines.{{sfn|Petroski|2006|pp=7–11}}

[[Mechanically stabilized earth]] (MSE) retaining walls may be used for embankments.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=131}}
MSE walls combine a concrete leveling pad, wall facing panels, coping, soil reinforcement and select backfill.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=3}}
A variety of designs of wall facing panels may be used.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=3}}
After the leveling pad has been laid and the first row of panels has been placed and braced, the first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind the wall and compacted.
The first set of reinforcements is then laid over the earth.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=15}}
The reinforcements, which may be tensioned polymer or galvanized metal strips or grids, are attached to the facing panels.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=2}}
This process is repeated with successive layers of panels, earth and reinforcements.
The panels are thus tied into the earth embankment to make a stable structure with balanced stresses.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=16-17}}

Although construction using the basic principles of MSE has a long history, MSE was developed in its current form in the 1960s. The reinforcing elements used can vary but include [[steel]] and [[geosynthetic]]s. The term MSE is usually used in the US to distinguish it from "Reinforced Earth", a trade name of the Reinforced Earth Company, but elsewhere Reinforced Soil is the generally accepted term.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=131}} MSE construction is relatively fast and inexpensive, and although labor-intensive, it does not demand high levels of skill. It is therefore suitable for developing as well as developed countries.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=132-133}}

===Forts and trenches===
[[File:Soldiers in trench.jpg|thumb|Soldiers in a trench on [[Gallipoli]] during World War I]]
Earth has been used to construct fortifications for thousands of years, including strongholds and walls, often protected by ditches.
Aerial photography in Europe has revealed traces of earth fortifications from the Roman era, and later medieval times.{{sfn|Bourgeois|Meganck|2005|p=323}}
[[Offa's Dyke]] is a huge earthwork that stretches along the disputed border between England and Wales.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=31}}
Little is known about the period or the builder, King [[Offa of Mercia]], who died in 796 AD.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=32}}
An early timber and earth fortification might later be succeeded by a brick or stone structure on the same site.{{sfn|Pluskowski|2013|p=118}}

Trenches were used by besieging forces to approach a fortification while protected from missiles.
Sappers would build "saps", or trenches, that zig-zagged towards the fortress being attacked.
They piled the excavated dirt to make a protective wall or gabion. The combined trench depth and gabion height might be {{convert|8|to|10|ft}}. 
Sometimes the sap was a tunnel, dug several feet below the surface. Sappers were highly skilled and highly paid due to the extreme danger of their work.{{sfn|Nolan|2008|p=417}}

In the [[American Civil War]] (1861−1865) trenches were used for defensive positions throughout the struggle, but played an increasingly important role in the campaigns of the last two years.{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=xiv}}
Military earthworks perhaps culminated in the vast network of trenches built during [[World War I]] (1914−1918) that stretched from [[Switzerland]] to the [[North Sea]] by the end of 1914.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=6}}
The two lines of trenches faced each other, manned by soldiers living in appalling conditions of cold, damp and filth.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=7}}
Conditions were worst in the Allied trenches. The Germans were more willing to accept the trenches as long-term positions, and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground, often with electrical lighting and heating.{{sfn|Horne|2011|p=214}}

===Embankment dams===
[[Image:MicaDam.JPG|thumb|The [[Mica Dam]] in [[Canada]]]]
An [[embankment dam]] is a massive artificial [[dam|water barrier]]. It is typically created by the emplacement and [[soil compaction|compaction]] of a complex semi-[[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or [[Seepage#Permeability and seepage|seepage]] [[erosion]].{{sfn|Dam Basics, PBS}}
The force of the impoundment creates a downward thrust upon the mass of the dam, greatly increasing the weight of the dam on its foundation. This added force effectively seals and makes waterproof the underlying foundation of the dam, at the interface between the dam and its [[stream bed]].{{sfn|Embankment dam: forces, PBS}} 
Such a dam is composed of fragmented independent material particles. 
The friction and interaction of particles binds the particles together into a stable mass rather than by the use of a cementing substance.{{sfn|Graham|1997}}

The [[Syncrude Tailings Dam|Syncrude Mildred Lake Tailings Dyke]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, is an embankment dam about {{convert|18|km}} long and from {{convert|40|to|88|m}} high. By volume of fill, as of 2001 it was believed to be the largest earth structure in the world.{{sfn|Morgenstern|2001|p=58}}

==Structural Issues==
===Designing for Earthquakes===
Regions with low seismic risk are safe for most earth buildings, but historic construction techniques often cannot resist even medium earthquake levels effectively because of earthen buildings' three highly undesirable qualities as a seismic building material: being relatively 'weak, heavy and brittle'. However, earthen buildings can be built to resist seismic loads.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bruce (2008) The Renaissance of Earthen Architecture: A fresh and updated look at clay-based construction&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors to improved seismic performance are soil strength, construction quality, robust layout and seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Langenbach, Randolph (2005) Collapse from the Inside Out. SismoAdobe 2005, Catholic University of Peru&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger soils make stronger walls. Adobe builders can test cured blocks for strength by dropping from a specific height or by breaking them with a lever.&lt;ref&gt;Standards New Zealand (1998) 4298:1998 [http://studylib.net/doc/18328751/nzs-4298--materials-and-workmanship-for-earth-buildings Materials and Workmanship for Earth Buildings] pp. 64-65, 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; Builders using immediate techniques like earthbag, cob, or rammed earth may prefer approximate crushing tests on smaller samples that can be oven-dried and crushed under a small lever.&lt;ref&gt;Stouter, Patti (2017) Field Tests for Strength of Building Soils, Build Simple Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Builders must understand construction processes and be able to produce consistent quality for strong buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Smart Shelter Foundation [http://www.smartshelterfoundation.org/smart-shelter-techniques/21-improving-building-quality/ Improving the Overall Construction Quality] (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Robust layout means buildings more square than elongated, and symmetrical not L-shaped,&lt;ref&gt;Totten,
 Craig (ed.) (2010) [http://aidg.org/documents/CM-Handout%20MASTER%20v3%20English.pdf Confined Masonry Workshop Handbook], 3rd edition, AIDG AWB and Haiti Rewired&lt;/ref&gt; as well as no 'soft' first stories (stories with large windows, buildings on unbraced columns). New Zealand's earthen building guidelines check for enough bracing wall length in each of the two principal directions, based on wall thickness, story height, bracing wall spacing, and the roof, loft and second story weight above earthen walls.&lt;ref&gt;Standards New Zealand (1998) [http://www.eastue.org/project/linea-adobe/norme/NZD4299-1998-Earth_Buildings_Not_Requiring_Specific_Design.pdf 4299:1998 Earth Buildings Not Requiring Specific Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismic-Resistant Construction Techniques===
Building techniques that are more ductile than brittle, like the [[contained earth]] type of earthbag, or tire walls of [[earthships]], may better avoid collapse than brittle unreinforced earth. Contained gravel base courses may add [[base isolation]] potential.

Wall containment can be added to techniques like adobe to resist loss of material that leads to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Blondet, Marcial, G. Villa Garcia M., S. Brzev and A. Rubinos (2011) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Adobe_Tutorial.pdf Earthquake Resistant Construction of Adobe Buildings: A Tutorial] Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Confined masonry is effective for adobe against quake forces of 0.3 g&lt;ref&gt;San Bartolome, A., E. Delgado and D. Quiun (2009) Seismic Behavior of a Two Story Model of Confined Adobe Masonry. 11th Canadian Masonry Symposium, Toronto, Ontario, May 31- June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez,
 Mario (undated) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Confined-Masonry_Rodriguez.pdf Confined Masonry Construction] Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; may be useful with earthen masonry.

Many types of reinforcement can increase wall strength, such as plastic or wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or fiberglass or bamboo. Earth resists compression well but is weak when twisted. Tensile reinforcement must span potential damage points and be well-anchored to increase out-of-plane stability. Bond beams at wall tops are vital and must be well attached to walls.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bruce. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Builders should be aware that organic reinforcements embedded in walls may be destroyed before the building is retired. Attachment details of reinforcement are critical to resist higher forces. Best adobe shear strength came from horizontal reinforcement attached directly to vertical rebar spanning from footing to bond beam.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Hugh (1993) The Strength of Engineered Earth Buildings. Ipenz Annual Conference 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlaced wood in earthen walls reduces quake damage if wood is not damaged by dry rot or insects. Timberlacing includes finely webbed Dhajji,&lt;ref&gt;Schacher, Tom and Q. Ali (2009) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dhajji_English.pdf Dhajji Construction for One and Two Story Earthquake Resistant Houses], United Nations Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; and other types.&lt;ref&gt;Langenbach, Rudolph [https://www.conservationtech.com/RL%27s%20resume&amp;%20pub%27s/RL-publications/Eq-pubs/2010-Kingdom-Of-Bhutan/Langenbach-BHUTAN.pdf Earthquake Resistant Traditional Construction is not an Oxymoron] Bhutan International Conference on Disaster Management and Cultural Heritage, 12–14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

[[File:Red Knot from The Crossley ID Guide Eastern Birds.jpg|thumb|A species plate from ''The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern Birds'', illustrating different plumages of the [[red knot]]]]
A '''field guide''' is a [[book]] designed to help the reader identify [[wildlife]] (plants or animals) or other objects of natural occurrence (e.g. [[mineral]]s). It is generally designed to be brought into the 'field' or local area where such objects exist to help distinguish between similar objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.illinois.edu/bix/fieldguides/index.html The International Field Guides Database]. Diane Schmidt. Accessed September 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Field guides are often designed to help users distinguish animals and plants that may be similar in appearance but are not necessarily closely related.

It will typically include a description of the objects covered, together with paintings or photographs and an index. More serious and scientific field identification books, including those intended for students, will probably include [[identification key]]s to assist with identification, but the publicly accessible field guide is more often a browsable picture guide organized by family, colour, shape, location or other descriptors.

==History==
Popular interests in identifying things in nature probably were strongest in bird and plant guides. Perhaps the first popular field guide to plants in the United States was the 1893 ''How to Know the Wildflowers'' by "Mrs. William Starr Dana" ([[Frances Theodora Parsons]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 1890, [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]] published ''Birds Through an Opera-Glass'', describing 70 common species.  Focused on living birds observed in the field, the book is considered the first in the tradition of modern, illustrated bird guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=Mark V.|title=A Passion for Birds: American Ornithology after Audubon|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691044026|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, now writing as Florence Merriam Bailey (having married the zoologist [[Vernon Orlando Bailey|Vernon Bailey]]), she published ''Handbook of Birds of the Western United States''.  By contrast, the ''Handbook'' is designed as a comprehensive reference for the lab rather a portable book for the field. It was arranged by [[taxonomic order]] and had clear descriptions of [[species]] size, distribution, feeding, and nesting habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kofalk|first=Harriet|title=No Woman Tenderfoot: Florence Merriam Bailey, Pioneer Naturalist|date=1989|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]|location=College Station, TX|isbn=0-89096-378-9|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point into the 1930s, features of field guides were introduced by [[Chester A. Reed]] and others such as changing the size of the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and woodland flowers, mushrooms, insects, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Thomas R.|title=In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders &amp; Their Guides|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199734597|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, [[Roger Tory Peterson]], using his fine skill as an artist, changed the way modern field guides approached identification. Using color plates with paintings of similar species together – and marked with arrows showing the differences – people could use his bird guide in the field to compare species quickly to make identification easier. This technique, the "[[Peterson Identification System]]", was used in most of Peterson's Field Guides from [[animal tracks]] to [[seashell]]s and has been widely adopted by other publishers and authors as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Today, each field guide has its own range, focus and organization.  Specialist publishers such as Croom Helm, along with organisations like the [[Audubon Society]],  the [[RSPB]], the [[Field Studies Council]], [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], [[HarperCollins]], and many others all produce quality field guides.

==Principles==

It is somewhat difficult to generalise about how field guides are intended to be used, because this varies from one guide to another, partly depending on how expert the targeted reader is expected to be.

For general public use, the main function of a field guide is to help the reader identify a bird, plant, rock, butterfly or other natural object down to at least the popular naming level. To this end some field guides employ simple keys and other techniques: the reader is usually encouraged to scan illustrations looking for a match, and to compare similar-looking choices using information on their differences. Guides are often designed to first lead readers to the appropriate section of the book, where the choices are not so overwhelming in number.

Guides for students often introduce the concept of [[identification key]]s. Plant field guides such as ''Newcomb's Wildflower Guide'' (which is limited in scope to the wildflowers of northeastern North America) frequently have an abbreviated key that helps limit the search.&lt;ref name=Newcomb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newcomb|first1=Lawrence|title=Newcomb's Wildflower Guide|date=1977|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-60442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect guides tend to limit identification to Order or Family levels rather than individual species, due to their diversity.

Many taxa show variability and it is often difficult to capture the constant features using a small number of photographs. Illustrations by artists or post processing of photographs help in emphasising specific features needed to for reliable identification. Peterson introduced the idea of lines to point to these key features. He also noted the advantages of illustrations over photographs:

{{quote|A drawing can do much more than a photograph to emphasize the field marks. A photograph is a record of a fleeting instant; a drawing is a composite of the artist's experience. The artist can edit out, show field marks to best advantage, and delete unnecessary clutter. He can choose position and stress basic color and pattern unmodified by transitory light and shade. ... The artist has more options and far more control .... Whereas a photograph can have a living immediacy a good drawing is really more instructive.  (This passage was written not by Roger Tory Peterson, but by his wife, Virginia Marie Peterson, in the preface to one of Peterson's field guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|title=A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern and Central North America|date=1989|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This passage was also quoted by Law and Lynch (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lists, Field Guides, and the Descriptive Organization of Seeing: Birdwatching as an Exemplary Observational Activity|author1=Law, John  |author2=Michael Lynch|journal= Human Studies|volume= 11|issue= 2/3|date=1988|pages=271–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}}

Field guides aid in improving the state of knowledge of various taxa. By making the knowledge of experienced museum specialists available to amateurs, they increase the gathering of information by amateurs from a wider geographic area and increasing the communication of these findings to the specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pearson, D. L.  |author2=Shetterly, J. A. |date=2006|title=How do published field guides influence interactions between amateurs and professionals in entomology? |journal=American Entomologist |volume=52|issue=4|pages=246–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight''' is the process by which an [[object (physics)|object]] [[Motion (physics)|moves]] through an [[atmosphere]] (or beyond it, as in the case of [[spaceflight]]) without contact with the surface. This can be achieved by generating [[Lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]] associated with [[Air propulsion|propulsive thrust]], [[Lighter than air|aerostatically]] using [[buoyancy]], or by [[ballistics|ballistic]] movement.

Many things can fly, from natural aviators such as [[bird]]s, [[bat]]s, and [[insect]]s, to human inventions like [[aircraft]], including [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[balloon]]s, and [[rocket]]s which may carry [[spacecraft]].

The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of [[aerospace engineering]] which is subdivided into [[aeronautics]], the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and [[astronautics]], the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in [[ballistics]], the study of the flight of projectiles.

==Types of flight==
===Buoyant flight===

{{main article|Aerostat}}
[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|An airship flies because the upward force, from air displacement, is equal to or greater than the force of gravity]]
Humans have managed to construct lighter than air vehicles that raise off the ground and fly, due to their [[buoyancy]] in air.

An '''aerostat''' is a system that remains aloft primarily through the use of [[buoyancy]] to give an aircraft the same overall density as air. Aerostats include [[balloon (aircraft)|free balloons]], [[airship]]s, and [[moored balloon]]s. An aerostat's main structural component is its [[wikt:envelope|envelope]], a lightweight [[skin]] that encloses a volume of [[lifting gas]]&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2000, p. 541. Quote: the gas-bag of a balloon or airship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulson-Thomas 1976, p. 281. Quote: fabric enclosing gas-bags of airship.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide [[buoyancy]], to which other components are attached.

Aerostats are so named because they use "aerostatic" lift, a [[buoyant]] force that does not require lateral movement through the surrounding air mass to effect a lifting force. By contrast, [[Aircraft#Heavier than air .E2.80.93 aerodynes|aerodynes]] primarily use [[aerodynamic]] [[lift (force)|lift]], which requires the lateral movement of at least some part of the [[aircraft]] through the surrounding air mass.

===Aerodynamic flight===

====Unpowered flight versus powered flight====
{{main article| Unpowered flight}}
Some things that fly do not generate propulsive thrust through the air, for example, the [[flying squirrel]]. This is termed [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. Some other things can exploit rising air to climb such as [[Bird of prey|raptors]] (when gliding) and [[glider (sailplane)|man-made sailplane gliders]]. This is termed [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]]. However most other birds and all [[powered aircraft]] need a source of [[propulsion]] to climb. This is termed powered flight.

====Animal flight====

[[File:Kea in Flight MC.jpg|thumb|[[Kea]]]]
{{Main article|Flying and gliding animals}}

The only groups of [[Flying and gliding animals|living things that use powered flight]] are [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[bat]]s, while many groups have evolved gliding. The extinct [[Pterosaur]]s, an [[Order (biology)|order]] of reptiles contemporaneous with the [[dinosaur]]s, were also very successful flying animals. Each of these groups' [[wing]]s [[evolution|evolved]] [[Convergent evolution|independently]]. The wings of the flying vertebrate groups are all based on the forelimbs, but differ significantly in structure; those of insects are hypothesized to be highly modified versions of structures that form gills in most other groups of [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Averof, Michalis. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6617/abs/385627a0.html "Evolutionary origin of insect wings from ancestral gills."] ''Nature'', Volume 385, Issue 385, February 1997, pp. 627–630.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved: April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several [[Flying squirrel|gliding mammals]] which are able to glide from tree to tree using fleshy membranes between their limbs; some can travel hundreds of meters in this way with very little loss in height. [[Flying frog]]s use greatly enlarged webbed feet for a similar purpose, and there are [[Draco blanfordii|flying lizards]] which fold out their mobile ribs into a pair of flat gliding surfaces. [[Chrysopelea|"Flying" snakes]] also use mobile ribs to flatten their body into an aerodynamic shape, with a back and forth motion much the same as they use on the ground.

[[Flying fish]] can glide using enlarged wing-like fins, and have been observed soaring for hundreds of meters. It is thought that this ability was chosen by [[natural selection]] because it was an effective means of escape from underwater predators. The longest recorded flight of a flying fish was 45 seconds.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7410421.stm "BBC article and video of flying fish."] ''BBC'', May 20, 2008. Retrieved: May 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[bird]]s fly (''see [[bird flight]]''), with some exceptions. The largest birds, the [[ostrich]] and the [[emu]], are earthbound, as were the now-extinct [[dodo]]s and the [[Phorusrhacids]], which were the dominant predators of South America in the [[Cenozoic]] era. The non-flying [[penguin]]s have wings adapted for use under water and use the same wing movements for swimming that most other birds use for flight.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Most small flightless birds are native to small islands, and lead a lifestyle where flight would offer little advantage.

Among living animals that fly, the [[wandering albatross]] has the greatest wingspan, up to {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}; the [[great bustard]] has the greatest weight, topping at {{convert|21|kg|lb|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumpeterswansociety.org/id.htm "Swan Identification."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031082245/http://www.trumpeterswansociety.org/id.htm |date=2006-10-31 }} ''The Trumpeter Swan Society.''

====Mechanical====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Anthony Fokker]] --&gt;
{{main article|Aviation}}

[[File:flight.rob.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Mechanical flight: A [[Robinson R22]] Beta [[helicopter]]]]

'''Mechanical flight''' is the use of a [[machine]] to fly. These machines include [[aircraft]] such as [[airplane]]s, [[glider aircraft|gliders]], [[helicopter]]s, [[autogyro]]s, [[airship]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[ornithopters]] as well as [[spacecraft]]. [[glider aircraft|Gliders]] are capable of unpowered flight. Another form of mechanical flight is para-sailing where a parachute-like object is pulled by a boat. In an airplane, lift is created by the wings; the shape of the wings of the airplane are designed specially for the type of flight desired. There are different types of wings: tempered, semi-tempered, sweptback, rectangular and elliptical. An aircraft wing is sometimes called an [[airfoil]], which is a device that creates lift when air flows across it.

=====Supersonic=====
{{main article|Supersonic speed}}
Supersonic flight is flight faster than the [[speed of sound]]. Supersonic flight is associated with the formation of [[shock wave]]s that form a [[sonic boom]] that can be heard from the ground,&lt;ref&gt;Bern, Peter. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm "Concorde: You asked a pilot."] ''BBC'', October 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently startling. This shockwave takes quite a lot of energy to create and this makes supersonic flight generally less efficient than subsonic flight at about 85% of the speed of sound.

=====Hypersonic=====
{{main article|Hypersonic speed}}
Hypersonic flight is very high speed flight where the heat generated by the compression of the air due to the motion through the air causes chemical changes to the air. Hypersonic flight is achieved by reentering spacecraft such as the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]].
[[File:ISS after STS-117 in June 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[International Space Station]] in earth [[orbit]]]]

===Ballistic===
{{main article|Ballistics}}

====Atmospheric====
Some things generate little or no lift and move only or mostly under the action of momentum, gravity, air drag and in some cases thrust. This is termed ''ballistic flight''. Examples include [[ball]]s, [[archery|arrows]], [[bullet]]s, [[firework]]s etc.

====Spaceflight====
{{main article|Spaceflight}}
Essentially an extreme form of ballistic flight, '''spaceflight''' is the use of [[space technology]] to achieve the flight of [[spacecraft]] into and through [[outer space]]. Examples include [[ballistic missile]]s, [[orbital spaceflight]] etc.

Spaceflight is used in [[space exploration]], and also in commercial activities like [[space tourism]] and [[telecommunications satellite|satellite telecommunications]]. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include [[Space observatory|space observatories]], [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and other [[earth observation satellite]]s.

A spaceflight typically begins with a [[rocket]] [[rocket launch|launch]], which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of [[gravity]] and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=kjVGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=A+spaceflight+typically+begins+with+a+rocket+launch,+which+provides+the+initial+thrust+to+overcome+the+force+of+gravity | title=Astronautics: A Historical Perspective of Mankind's Efforts to Conquer the Cosmos | last=Spitzmiller | first=Ted | date=2007 | page=467 | publisher=Apogee Books | isbn=9781894959667 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called [[astrodynamics]]. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during [[atmospheric reentry]], and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

==Physics==
[[File:Luftschiff small.jpg|thumb|Lighter-than-air [[airship]]s are able to fly without any major input of energy]]
{{main article|Aerodynamics}}

There are different approaches to flight. If an object has a lower [[density]] than air, then it is [[buoyancy|buoyant]] and is able to [[aerostat|float in the air]] without expending energy. A [[heavier than air]] craft, known as an [[Aircraft#Heavier than air .80.93 aerodynes|aerodyne]], includes flighted animals and insects, [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[rotorcraft]]. Because the craft is heavier than air, it must generate [[lift (force)|lift]] to overcome its [[weight]]. The wind resistance caused by the craft moving through the air is called [[drag (physics)|drag]] and is overcome by [[Air propulsion|propulsive thrust]] except in the case of [[gliding (flight)|gliding]].

Some vehicles also use thrust for flight, for example [[rocket]]s and [[Harrier Jump Jet]]s.

Finally, [[momentum]] dominates the flight of ballistic flying objects.

===Forces===
[[File:Forces2.gif|thumb|Main forces on a heavier-than-air aircraft]]
{{main article|Aerodynamics}}

Forces relevant to flight are&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/forces.html "Four forces on an aeroplane."] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: January 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Air propulsion|Propulsive thrust]] (except in gliders)
* [[Lift (force)|Lift]], created by the reaction to an airflow
* [[Drag (physics)|Drag]], created by aerodynamic [[friction]]
* [[Weight]], created by gravity
* [[Buoyancy]], for lighter than air flight

These forces must be balanced for stable flight to occur.

====Thrust====
{{main|Thrust}}
[[File:aeroforces.svg|thumb|Forces on an [[aerofoil]] cross section]]

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight.  This can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], or a rotating [[Mechanical fan|fan]] pushing air out from the back of a [[jet engine]], or by ejecting hot gases from a [[rocket engine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/newton3.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The forward thrust is proportional to the [[mass]] of the airstream multiplied by the difference in [[velocity]] of the airstream. Reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by reversing the pitch of variable-pitch propeller blades, or using a [[Thrust reversal|thrust reverser]] on a jet engine. [[Rotary wing aircraft]] and [[thrust vectoring]] [[V/STOL]] aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft, and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed.

====Lift====
{{main article|lift (force)}}
[[File:Airfoil lift and drag.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lift is defined as the component of the total aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction, and drag is the component parallel to the flow direction]]
In the context of an [[fluid flow|air flow]] relative to a flying body, the '''lift''' force is the [[Vector (geometric)#Vector components|component]] of the [[aerodynamic force]] that is [[perpendicular]] to the flow direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/aerosim/Manual/fsim0020.htm "Definition of lift."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203074439/http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/aerosim/Manual/fsim0020.htm |date=2009-02-03 }} ''NASA.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamic lift results when the wing causes the surrounding air to be deflected - the air then causes a force on the wing in the opposite direction, in accordance with [[Newton's third law of motion]].

Lift is commonly associated with the [[wing]] of an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], although lift is also generated by [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]] on [[rotorcraft]] (which are effectively rotating wings, performing the same function without requiring that the aircraft move forward through the air). While common meanings of the word "[[wikt:lift#English|lift]]" suggest that lift opposes gravity, aerodynamic lift can be in any direction. When an aircraft is [[cruise (flight)|cruising]] for example, lift does oppose gravity, but lift occurs at an angle when climbing, descending or banking. On high-speed cars, the lift force is directed downwards (called "down-force") to keep the car stable on the road.

Lift can also occur in a different way if the air is not still, especially if there is an updraft due to heat ("thermals") or wind blowing along sloping terrain or other meteorological conditions. This form of lift permits [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] and is particularly important for gliding. It is used by birds and gliders to stay in the air for long periods with little effort.

====Drag====
{{main article|Drag (physics)}}
For a solid object moving through a fluid, the drag is the component of the [[Net force|net]] [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] or [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] [[force]] acting opposite to the direction of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;French 1970, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/physics.html "Basic flight physics."] ''Berkeley University.''

Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, drag opposes the motion of the object, and in a powered vehicle it must be overcome by [[thrust]]. The process which creates lift also causes some drag.

====Lift-to-drag ratio====
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Speed and drag relationships for a typical aircraft]]
{{main article|Lift-to-drag ratio}}
Aerodynamic lift is created by the motion of an aerodynamic object (wing) through the air, which due to its shape and angle deflects the air. For sustained straight and level flight, lift must be equal and opposite to weight. In general, long narrow wings are able deflect a large amount of air at a slow speed, whereas smaller wings need a higher forward speed to deflect an equivalent amount of air and thus generate an equivalent amount of lift. Large cargo aircraft tend to use longer wings with higher angles of attack, whereas supersonic aircraft tend to have short wings and rely heavily on high forward speed to generate lift.

However, this lift (deflection) process inevitably causes a retarding force called drag. Because lift and drag are both aerodynamic forces, the ratio of lift to drag is an indication of the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane. The lift to drag ratio is the L/D ratio, pronounced "L over D ratio." An airplane has a high L/D ratio if it produces a large amount of lift or a small amount of drag. The lift/drag ratio is determined by dividing the lift coefficient by the drag coefficient, CL/CD. &lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The lift coefficient Cl is equal to the lift L divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the wing area A). [Cl = L / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] The lift coefficient is also affected by the compressibility of the air, which is much greater at higher speeds, so velocity V is not a linear function. Compressibility is also affected by the shape of the aircraft surfaces.
&lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/liftco.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The drag coefficient Cd is equal to the drag D divided by the (density r times half the velocity V squared times the reference area A). [Cd = D / (A * .5 * r * V^2)] 
&lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragco.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Lift-to-drag ratios for practical aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 or more for vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag. 

Lift/drag ratio also determines the glide ratio and gliding range. Since the glide ratio is based only on the relationship of the aerodynamics forces acting on the aircraft, aircraft weight will not affect it. The only effect weight has is to vary the time that the aircraft will glide for – a heavier aircraft gliding at a higher airspeed will arrive at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. &lt;ref&gt;The Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics - NASA Glenn Research Center   
https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buoyancy====
{{main article|Buoyancy}}
Air pressure acting up against an object in air is greater than the pressure above pushing down. The buoyancy, in both cases, is equal to the weight of fluid displaced - [[Archimedes' principle]] holds for air just as it does for water.

A cubic meter of air at ordinary [[atmospheric pressure]] and room temperature has a mass of about 1.2 kilograms, so its weight is about 12 newtons. Therefore, any 1-cubic-meter object in air is buoyed up with a force of 12 newtons. If the mass of the 1-cubic-meter object is greater than 1.2 kilograms (so that its weight is greater than 12 newtons), it falls to the ground when released. If an object of this size has a mass less than 1.2 kilograms, it rises in the air. Any object that has a mass that is less than the mass of an equal volume of air will rise in air - in other words, any object less dense than air will rise.

====Thrust to weight ratio====
{{main article|Thrust-to-weight ratio}}
'''Thrust-to-weight ratio''' is, as its name suggests, the ratio of instantaneous [[thrust]] to [[weight]] (where weight means weight at the [[Earth]]'s standard acceleration &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;Sutton and Biblarz 2000, p. 442. Quote: "thrust-to-weight ratio F/W&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g0) if it could fly by itself in a gravity free vacuum."&lt;/ref&gt; It is a dimensionless parameter characteristic of [[rocket]]s and other jet engines and of vehicles propelled by such engines (typically space [[launch vehicle]]s and jet [[aircraft]]).

If the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] is greater than the local gravity strength (expressed in ''g''s), then flight can occur without any forward motion or any aerodynamic lift being required.

If the thrust-to-weight ratio times the lift-to-drag ratio is greater than local gravity then [[takeoff]] using aerodynamic lift is possible.

===Flight dynamics===

[[File:dihedral.airliner.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The upward tilt of the wings and tailplane of an aircraft, as seen on this [[Boeing 737]], is called dihedral angle]]{{main article|Flight dynamics}}
'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of [[aircraft|air]] and [[spacecraft|space]] vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'' (See [[Tait-Bryan rotations]] for an explanation).

The control of these dimensions can involve a [[horizontal stabilizer]] (i.e. "a tail"), [[ailerons]] and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. flight attitude (which in turn affects [[altitude]], [[Aircraft heading|heading]]). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have "positive [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]]" which gives inherent roll stabilization.

===Energy efficiency===
{{main article|propulsive efficiency}}
To create thrust so as to be able to gain height, and to push through the air to overcome the drag associated with lift all takes energy. Different objects and creatures capable of flight vary in the efficiency of their muscles, motors and how well this translates into forward thrust.

Propulsive efficiency determines how much energy vehicles generate from a unit of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3 "History."] ''NASA.'' Retrieved: May 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honicke et al. 1968 {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
{{main article|range (aircraft)}}
The range that powered flight articles can achieve is ultimately limited by their drag, as well as how much energy they can store on board and how efficiently they can turn that energy into propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node98.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For powered aircraft the useful energy is determined by their [[fuel fraction]]- what percentage of the takeoff weight is fuel, as well as the [[specific energy]] of the fuel used.

===Power-to-weight ratio===
{{main article|power-to-weight ratio}}
All animals and devices capable of sustained flight need relatively high power-to-weight ratios to be able to generate enough lift and/or thrust to achieve take off.

==Takeoff and landing==
{{main article|takeoff and landing}}
Vehicles that can fly can have different ways to '''takeoff and land'''. Conventional aircraft accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for [[takeoff]], and reverse the process for [[landing]]. Some aircraft can take off at low speed; this is called a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier jump jets can take off and land vertically. Rockets also usually take off and land vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.

==Guidance, navigation and control==
{{main article|Guidance, navigation and control}}

===Navigation===
[[Navigation]] is the systems necessary to calculate current position (e.g. [[compass]], [[GPS]], [[LORAN]], [[star tracker]], [[inertial measurement unit]], and [[altimeter]]).

In aircraft, successful [[air navigation]] involves piloting an aircraft from place to place without getting lost, breaking the laws applying to aircraft, or endangering the safety of those on board or on the [[Earth|ground]].

The techniques used for navigation in the air will depend on whether the aircraft is flying under the [[visual flight rules]] (VFR) or the [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR). In the latter case, the [[aviator|pilot]] will navigate exclusively using [[flight instruments|instruments]] and [[radio navigation aid]]s such as beacons, or as directed under [[radar]] control by [[air traffic control]]. In the VFR case, a pilot will largely navigate using [[dead reckoning]] combined with visual observations (known as [[pilotage]]), with reference to appropriate maps. This may be supplemented using radio navigation aids.

===Guidance===
{{main article|Guidance system}}
A '''guidance system''' is a device or group of devices used in the [[navigation]] of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or other moving object. Typically, guidance is responsible for the calculation of the vector (i.e., direction, velocity) toward an objective.

===Control===

{{main article|Flight control system}}
A conventional fixed-wing '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.

====Traffic====
In the case of aircraft, air traffic is controlled by [[air traffic control]] systems.

[[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|Collision avoidance]] is the process of controlling spacecraft to try to prevent collisions.

==Flight safety==
{{main article|aviation safety}}
'''Air safety''' is a term encompassing the theory, investigation and categorization of [[Aviation accidents and incidents|flight failures]], and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of [[air travel]].

'''''Flute's Journey: The Life of a Wood Thrush''''' is a children's picture book by [[Lynne Cherry]].

==Plot summary==
The book tells the first year of a [[wood thrush|wood thrush's]] life starting from it hatching in a forest that is in [[Maryland]]. Two children see the bird when it is young and calls it Flute. The children wait for Flute to return from [[bird migration|migration]] and watch him and his [[Mating|mate]] build a [[bird nest|nest]] and raise their young. In Flute's travels, he encounters many dangers. The [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[nestlings]] are at more of a risk.

==Reception==
A review in the book ''Gotcha!: Nonfiction Booktalks to Get Kids Excited about Reading'' says, "Whether or not you know much about songbirds and the dangers they face, this book is great reading, and it includes ideas for things that kids can do to help them. The illustration of Flute's mother feeding her babies a worm is a good one to show."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FQrW4WYRKs4C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Flute%27s+Journey:+The+Life+of+a+Wood+Thrush&amp;lr=#PPA44,M1  Gotcha!: Nonfiction Booktalks to Get Kids Excited about Reading]&lt;/ref&gt; Books use the book for activities for kids to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q8oYWI7KFi0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Flute%27s+Journey:+The+Life+of+a+Wood+Thrush&amp;lr= Writing with Authors Kids Love]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KPNotFXqXQ0C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=Flute%27s+Journey:+The+Life+of+a+Wood+Thrush&amp;lr= Young Adult Literature in the Classroom]&lt;/ref&gt; The book focused national media attention on conservation efforts to save the Belt Woods in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhousenet.org/network/dcarea.html Green House Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227091029/http://www.greenhousenet.org/network/dcarea.html |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreline''' is a [[vacuum]] line between the [[pump]]s of a [[wikt:multistage|multistage]] vacuum system. No longer exclusively used by [[scientist]]s in [[research]], vacuum systems are used in numerous industries that include [[food production]] and the [[manufacture|manufacturing]] of [[electronic component]]s. A classic foreline is a [[hose]] or [[Pneumatic tube|tube]] that connects a [[rotary vane pump]] to the [[wikt:outlet|outlet]] of an [[oil diffusion pump]], although vacuum [[technology]] now uses a vast array of [[roughing pump]]s and high [[vacuum pump]]s.

Although the term has been used for many [[decade]]s in the high vacuum system [[industry]] and in [[literature]] concerning vacuum systems, the word foreline has not yet been added to any [[dictionary]].

'''''Freddy Fox''''' ({{ISBN|0-9754701-0-8}}) is a [[hardcover]] [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Ronald J. Meyer]]. It tells the story of a young fox and his family, following the daily activities of the fox kit, Freddy.  Freddy Fox teaches the reader about [[red fox]]es, including that they are born shades of gray, how their den is built, what they eat, and family size. Then through a simple segue, Freddy's red fox mother teaches the young fox about other animals and traits attributed to them.  By learning his lessons, Freddy will grow up to be a wise fox.  All of the lessons, such as the [[bear]] eats a balanced diet or the [[raccoon]] washes his hands before eating, can easily be translated into lessons for young children.

The book was first published in 2004. It won the Silver [[Mom's Choice Award]] in the "Animal Kingdom" category in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php Mom's Choice Awards 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225071706/http://www.momschoiceawards.com/celebrate08.php |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author is a [[wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]], and he used his wildlife photographs to illustrate the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21023">[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The explosion of the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]]. The hydrogen bomb is the only known man-made item to achieve fusion energy gain factor larger than 1.]]

The '''fusion energy gain factor''', usually expressed with the symbol '''''Q''''', is the ratio of [[fusion power]] produced in a [[nuclear fusion]] reactor to the power required to maintain the [[Plasma physics|plasma]]  in [[steady state]]. The condition of ''Q'' = 1, when the power being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is referred to as '''breakeven'''.

The power given off by the fusion reactions may be captured within the fuel, leading to ''self-heating''. Most fusion reactions release at least some of their energy in a form that cannot be captured within the plasma, so a system at ''Q'' = 1 will cool without external heating. With typical fuels, self-heating in fusion reactors is not expected to match the external sources until at least ''Q'' = 5. If ''Q'' increases past this point, increasing self-heating eventually removes the need for external heating. At this point the reaction becomes self-sustaining, a condition called '''ignition'''. Ignition corresponds to infinite ''Q'', and is generally regarded as highly desirable for a practical reactor design.

Over time, several related terms have entered the fusion lexicon. As a reactor does not cover its own heating losses until about ''Q'' = 5, the term '''engineering breakeven''' is sometimes used to describe a reactor that produces enough electricity to provide that heating. Above engineering breakeven a machine would produce more electricity than it uses, and could sell that excess. A machine that can sell enough electricity to cover its operating costs, estimated to require at least ''Q'' = 20, is sometimes known as '''economic breakeven'''.

{{Asof|2017}}, the record for ''Q'' is held by the [[Joint European Torus|JET]] tokamak in the UK, at ''Q'' = (16 MW)/(24 MW) ≈ 0.67, first attained in 1997. [[ITER]] was originally designed to reach ignition, but is currently designed to reach ''Q'' = 10, producing 500&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion power from 50&amp;nbsp;MW of injected thermal power.

==Concept==
''Q'' is simply the comparison of the [[Fusion power|power]] being released by the fusion reactions in a reactor, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, to the constant heating power being supplied, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there are several definitions of breakeven that consider additional power losses.

===Breakeven===
In 1955, [[John D. Lawson (scientist)|John Lawson]] was the first to explore the energy balance mechanisms in detail, initially in classified works but published openly in a now-famous 1957 paper. In this paper he considered and refined work by earlier researchers, notably [[Hans Thirring]], [[Peter Thonemann]], and a review article by [[Richard Post]]. Expanding on all of these, Lawson's paper made detailed predictions for the amount of power that would be lost through various mechanisms, and compared that to the energy needed to sustain the reaction.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} This balance is today known as the [[Lawson criterion]].

In a successful fusion reactor design, the fusion reactions generate an amount of power designated ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.{{efn|This was denoted ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in Lawson's original paper, but changed here to match modern terminology.}} Some amount of this energy, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;, is lost through a variety of mechanisms, mostly convection of the fuel to the walls of the reactor chamber and various forms of radiation that cannot be captured to generate power. In order to keep the reaction going, the system has to provide heating to make up for these losses, where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to maintain thermal equilibrium.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|pp=8-9}}

The most basic definition of breakeven is when ''Q'' = 1,{{efn|In Lawson's original paper, the term ''Q'' was used to denote the total energy released by the individual fusion reactions, in MeV, and ''R'' referred to the power balance.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} Later works used ''Q'' to refer to the power balance, as it is used in this article.}} that is, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;.

Some works refer to this definition as '''scientific breakeven''', to contrast it with similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Nuclear Society |url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/fst/a_22885 |title= The Mirror Fusion Test Facility: An Intermediate Device to a Mirror Fusion Reactor  |first=V. N. |last=Karpenko |volume=4 |number=2P2 |date=September 1983 |doi=10.13182/FST83-A22885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= 17th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/event/rcn/9860_en.html | date =19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage is rare outside certain areas, specifically the [[inertial confinement fusion]] field, where the term is much more widely used.

===Extrapolated breakeven===
Since the 1950s, most commercial fusion reactor designs have been based on a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] as their primary fuel; others fuels have been studied for a variety of reasons but are much harder to ignite. As tritium is radioactive, highly bioactive and highly mobile, it represents a significant safety concern and adds to the cost of designing and operating such a reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |url=https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/ |title=Fusion reactors: Not what they’re cracked up to be |date=19 April 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Jassby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to lower costs, many experimental machines are designed to run on test fuels of hydrogen or deuterium alone, leaving out the tritium. In this case, the term '''extrapolated breakeven''' is used to define the expected performance of the machine running on D-T fuel based on the performance when running on hydrogen or deuterium alone.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ees.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~web_dai5/english/B.html |title=Plasma Dictionary |website=Nagoya University |first= M. A. |last=Razzak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records for extrapolated breakeven are slightly higher than the records for scientific breakeven. Both JET and JT-60 have reached values around 1.25 (see below for details) while running on D-D fuel. When running on D-T, only possible in JET, the maximum performance is about half the extrapolated value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

===Engineering breakeven===
Another related term, '''engineering breakeven''', considers the need to extract the energy from the reactor, turn that into electrical energy, and feed that back into the heating system.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This closed loop is known as ''recirculation''. In this case, the basic definition changes by adding additional terms to the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; side to consider the efficiencies of these processes.

Most fusion reactions release energy in a variety of forms, mostly [[neutron]]s and a variety of charged particles like [[alpha particle]]s. Neutrons are electrically neutral and will travel out of any [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MFE) design, and in spite of the very high densities found in [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) designs, they tend to easily escape the fuel mass in these designs as well. This means that only the charged particles from the reactions can be captured within the fuel mass and give rise to self-heating. If the fraction of the energy being released in the charged particles is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, then the power in these particles is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. If this self-heating process is perfect, that is, all of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; is captured in the fuel, that means the power available for generating electricity is the power that is not released in that form, or (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the case of neutrons carrying most of the practical energy, as is the case in the D-T fuel studied in most designs, this neutron energy is normally captured in a "blanket" of  [[lithium]] that produces more tritium that is used to fuel the reactor. Due to various [[exothermic]] and [[endothermic]] reactions, the blanket may have a power gain factor a few percent higher or lower than 100%, but that will be neglected here. The blanket is then cooled and the [[cooling fluid]] used in a [[heat exchanger]] driving conventional [[steam turbine]]s. These have an efficiency η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; which is around 35 to 40%.

Consider a system that uses external heaters to heat the fusion fuel, then extracts the power from those reactions to generate electrical power. Some fraction of that power, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;, is needed to recirculate back into the heaters to close the loop. This is not the same as the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; because the self-heating processes are providing some of the required energy. While the system as a whole requires additional power for building climate control, lighting, and the confinement system, these are generally much smaller than the plasma heating system requirements.
 
Considering all of these factors, the heating power can thus be related to the fusion power by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;P_{heat} = \eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})\cdot P_{fus}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency that power supplied to the heating systems is turned into heat in the fuel, as opposed to lost in the equipment itself, and &lt;math&gt;\eta_{elec}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency achieved when turning the heat into electrical power, for instance, through the [[Rankine cycle]].

The fusion energy gain factor is then defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Q_E \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})} &lt;/math&gt;

===Ignition===
As the temperature of the plasma increases, the rate of fusion reactions grows rapidly, and with it, the rate of self heating. In contrast, the non-capturable energy losses like x-rays do not grow at the same rate. Thus, in overall terms, the self-heating process becomes more efficient as the temperature increases, and less energy is needed from external sources to keep it hot.

Eventually ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; reaches zero, that is, all of the energy needed to keep the plasma at the operational temperature is being supplied by self-heating, and the amount of external energy that needs to be added drops to zero. This point is known as '''ignition'''.

Ignition, by definition, corresponds to an infinite ''Q'', but it does not mean that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; drops to zero as the other power sinks in the system, like the magnets and cooling systems, still need to be powered. Generally, however, these are much smaller than the energy in the heaters, and require a much smaller ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, this number is more likely to be near constant, meaning that further improvements in plasma performance will result in more energy that can be directly used for commercial generation, as opposed to recirculation.

===Commercial breakeven===
The final definition of breakeven is '''commercial breakeven''', which occurs when the economic value of any net energy left over after recirculation is enough to finance the construction of the reactor.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This value depends both on the reactor and the [[spot price]] of electrical power.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary |website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial breakeven relies on factors outside the technology of the reactor itself, and it is possible that even a reactor with a fully ignited plasma will not generate enough energy to pay for itself. Whether any of the mainline concepts like [[ITER]] can reach this goal is being debated in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://issues.org/31-4/fusion-research-time-to-set-a-new-path/ |title=Fusion Research: Time to Set a New Path |first=Robert |last=Hirsch |date=Summer 2015 |magazine=Issues in Technology |volume=31 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical example==
Most fusion reactor designs being studied {{asof|2017|lc=yes}} are based on the D-T reaction, as this is by far the easiest to ignite, and is energy dense. However, this reaction also gives off most of its energy in the form of a single highly energetic neutron, and only 20% of the energy in the form of an alpha. Thus, for the D-T reaction, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2. This means that self-heating does not become equal to the external heating until at least ''Q'' = 5. 

Efficiency values depend on design details but may be in the range of η&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7 (70%) and η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.4 (40%). The purpose of a fusion reactor is to produce power, not to recirculate it, so a practical reactor must have ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 approximately. Lower would be better but will be hard to achieve. Using these values we find for a practical reactor ''Q'' = 22.

==Transient vs. continual==
Many early fusion devices operated for microseconds, using some sort of pulsed power source to feed their [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]] system and used the confinement as the heating source. Lawson defined breakeven in this context as the total energy released by the entire reaction cycle compared to the total energy supplied to the machine during the same cycle.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Over time, as performance increased by orders of magnitude, the reaction times have extended from microseconds to seconds, and in [[ITER]], on the order of minutes. In this case definition of "the entire reaction cycle" becomes blurred. In the case of an ignited plasma, for instance, P&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; may be quite high while the system is being set up, and then drop to zero when it is fully developed, so one may be tempted to pick an instant in time when it is operating at its best to determine ''Q''. A better solution in these cases is to use the original Lawson definition averaged over the reaction to produce a similar value as the original definition.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

However, there is a complication. During the heating phase when the system is being brought up to operational conditions, some of the energy released by the fusion reactions will be used to heat the surrounding fuel, and thus not be released. This is no longer true when the plasma reaches its operational temperature and enters thermal equilibrium. Thus, if one averages over the entire cycle, this energy will be included as part of the heating term, that is, some of the energy that was captured for heating would otherwise have been released in P&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; and is therefore not indicative of an operational ''Q''.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Operators of the JET reactor argued that this input should be removed from the total:

&lt;math&gt; Q* \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat} - P_{temp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt; P_{temp} = \frac{dWp}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, P&lt;sub&gt;temp&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of energy needed to raise the internal energy of the plasma. It is this definition that was used when reporting JET's record 0.67 value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Some debate over this definition continues. In 1998, the operators of the [[JT-60]] claimed to have reached ''Q'' = 1.25 running on D-D fuel, thus reaching extrapolated breakeven. However, this measurement was based on the JET definition of Q*. Using this definition, JET had also reached extrapolated breakeven some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |title=JT-60U Reaches 1.25 of Equivalent Fusion Power Gain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106002827/http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |archive-date=6 January 2013 |date=7 August 1998 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one considers the energy balance in these conditions, and the analysis of previous machines, it is argued the original definition should be used, and thus both machines remain well below break-even of any sort.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

==Scientific breakeven at NIF==
Although most fusion experiments use some form of magnetic confinement, another major branch is [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) that mechanically presses together the fuel mass (the "target") to increase its density. This greatly increases the rate of fusion events and lowers the need to confine the fuel for long periods. This compression is accomplished by heating a lightweight capsule holding the fuel so rapidly that it explodes outwards, driving the fuel mass on the inside inward in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. There are a variety of proposed "drivers" to cause the implosion process, but to date most experiments have used [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://kfe.fjfi.cvut.cz/~limpouch/plazma/Pfalzner_Introduction_ICF.pdf |title=An Introduction to Inertial Confinement Fusion |first=S. |last=Pfalzner |publisher=CRC Press |date=2006 |pages=13-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using the traditional definition of ''Q'', ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;, ICF devices have extremely low ''Q''. This is because the laser is extremely inefficient; whereas &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; for the heaters used in magnetic systems might be on the order of 70%, lasers are on the order of 1.5%. For this reason, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the leader in ICF research, has proposed another modification of ''Q'' that defines ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; as the energy delivered by the driver, as opposed to the energy put into the driver. This definition produces much higher ''Q'' values, and changes the definition of breakeven to be ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;laser&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. On occasion, they referred to this definition as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Status of the NIF Project |first=Edward |last=Moses |date=4 May 2007 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Optics |first=H.

On 7 October 2013, the BBC announced that LLNL had achieved scientific breakeven in the [[National Ignition Facility]]  (NIF) on 29 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24429621 |date=7 October 2013 |title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Nature |url=https://www.nature.com/news/laser-fusion-experiment-extracts-net-energy-from-fuel-1.14710 |title=Laser fusion experiment extracts net energy from fuel |first=Philip |last=Ball |date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=HiPER |url=http://www.hiper-laser.org/News%20and%20events/index.html |title=Latest Fusion Results from the National Ignition Facility |date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; was approximately 14&amp;nbsp;kJ, while the laser output was 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ. By their previous definition, this would be a ''Q'' of 0.0077. However, for this press release, they re-defined ''Q'' once again, this time equating ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to be only the amount energy delivered to "the hottest portion of the fuel", calculating that only 10&amp;nbsp;kJ of the original laser energy reached the part of the fuel that was undergoing fusion reactions. This release has been heavily criticized in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=FIRE |url=https://fire.pppl.gov/ICF_Scientific_Breakeven_LLNL2.pdf |title=Scientific Breakeven for Fusion Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Science |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/fusion-breakthrough-nif-uh-not-really |title=Fusion "Breakthrough" at NIF?

'''Henry David Thoreau''' (see [[Henry David Thoreau#Pronunciation of his name|name pronunciation]]; July 12, 1817&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 1862) was an American [[essay]]ist, [[poet]], [[philosopher]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], [[tax resistance|tax resister]], [[development criticism|development critic]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and [[historian]]. A leading [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]],&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Daniel Walker, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848''. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507894-7}}, p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]" (originally published as "Resistance to Civil Government"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state.

Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his [[nature writing|writings on natural history]] and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and [[environmental history]], two sources of modern-day [[environmentalism]]. His [[Literary language|literary]] style interweaves close observation of nature, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, [[symbol]]ic meanings, and historical lore, while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical [[Asceticism|austerity]], and Yankee attention to practical detail.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Thoreau, Henry David. ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers''&amp;nbsp;/ ''Walden''&amp;nbsp;/ ''The Maine Woods''&amp;nbsp;/ ''Cape Cod''. Library of America. {{ISBN|0-940450-27-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and [[illusion]] in order to discover life's true essential needs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the [[fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Law]] while praising the writings of [[Wendell Phillips]] and defending the abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. Thoreau's philosophy of [[civil disobedience]] later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thoreau is sometimes referred to as an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Edwin Robert Anderson; Johnson, Alvin Saunders, eds. (1937). ''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David, ed. ''The Price of Freedom: Political Philosophy from Thoreau's Journals''. p. 8. {{ISBN|978-1-4348-0552-2}}. "The Thoreau of these journals distrusted doctrine, and, though it is accurate I think to call him an anarchist, he was by no means doctrinaire in this either."&lt;/ref&gt; Though "Civil Disobedience" seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—"I ask for, not at once no government, but ''at once'' a better government"&lt;ref name="resistance"&gt;Thoreau, H. D. "[http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=rtcg#p03 Resistance to Civil Government]".&lt;/ref&gt;—the direction of this improvement contrarily points toward anarchism: "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

==Pronunciation of his name==
[[Amos Bronson Alcott]] and Thoreau's aunt each wrote that "Thoreau" is pronounced like the word ''thorough'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ʌr|oʊ}} {{respell|THURR|oh}}—in [[General American]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/pronounce THUR-oh or Thor-OH? And How Do We Know?] ''Thoreau Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/walden/ Thoreau's Walden]'', under the sidebar "Pronouncing Thoreau".&lt;/ref&gt; but more precisely {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɔːr|oʊ}} {{respell|THOR|oh}}—in 19th-century New England). [[Edward Waldo Emerson]] wrote that the name should be pronounced "Thó-row", with the ''h'' sounded and stress on the first syllable.&lt;ref&gt;See the note on pronouncing the name at [http://www.walden.org/Thoreau#Name the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods].&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern-day American speakers, it is perhaps more commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|θ|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|thə|ROH}}—with stress on the second syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thoreau|publisher=Dictionary.com|date=2013|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/thoreau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, J. C. (1990) ''Pronunciation Dictionary'', s.v. "Thoreau". Essex, U.K.: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
Thoreau had a distinctive appearance, with a nose that he called his "most prominent feature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cape Cod|last=Thoreau|first=Henry David|publisher=|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 10-A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;His face, once seen, could not be forgotten. The features were quite marked: the nose aquiline or very Roman, like one of the portraits of Caesar (more like a beak, as was said); large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen, in certain lights, and in others gray,—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling, but never weak or near-sighted; the forehead not unusually broad or high, full of concentrated energy and purpose; the mouth with prominent lips, pursed up with meaning and thought when silent, and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to legend, Thoreau refused to pay the five-dollar fee (approximately {{inflation|US|5|1840|fmt=eq}}) for a Harvard diploma.

===Return to Concord, 1837–1844===
The traditional professions open to college graduates—law, the church, business, medicine—did not interest Thoreau,&lt;ref name="sattelmeyer"&gt;Sattelmeyer, Robert (1988). ''Thoreau's Reading: A Study in Intellectual History with Bibliographical Catalogue''.

Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|25}} so in 1835 he took a leave of absence from Harvard, during which he taught school in [[Canton, Massachusetts]]. After he graduated in 1837, he joined the faculty of the Concord public school, but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref name="sattelmeyer"/&gt;{{Rp|25}} He and his brother John then opened the Concord Academy, a [[grammar school]] in Concord, in 1838.&lt;!-- Concord Academy (1822–1863) is a different institution than Concord Academy (est. 1922). --&gt;&lt;ref name="sattelmeyer" /&gt;{{Rp|25}} They introduced several progressive concepts, including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses. The school closed when John became fatally ill from [[tetanus]] in 1842 after cutting himself while shaving.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bradley P.

"[http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/thoreau/ Henry David Thoreau]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation Thoreau returned home to Concord, where he met [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] through a mutual friend.&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; Emerson, who was 14 years his senior, took a paternal and at times patron-like interest in Thoreau, advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers, including [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|Ellery Channing]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott|Bronson Alcott]], and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and his son [[Julian Hawthorne]], who was a boy at the time.

Emerson urged Thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical, ''[[The Dial]]'', and lobbied the editor, Margaret Fuller, to publish those writings. Thoreau's first essay published in ''The Dial'' was "Aulus Persius Flaccus,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|title=Aulus Persius Flaccus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925021512/http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/About%20Thoreau/D/Dial/AulusPersiusFlaccus.pdf|archive-date=September 25, 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an essay on the Roman playwright, in July 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |title=''The Dial'' |publisher=Walden.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018151944/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/The_Dial |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of revised passages from his journal, which he had begun keeping at Emerson's suggestion. The first journal entry, on October 22, 1837, reads, "'What are you doing now?' he asked. 'Do you keep a journal?' So I make my first entry to-day."&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (2007). ''I to Myself: An Annotated Selection from the Journal of Henry D. Thoreau''. Jeffrey S. Cramer, ed. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition. In his early years he followed [[Transcendentalism]], a loose and eclectic [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the "radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts", as Emerson wrote in ''Nature'' (1836).

On April 18, 1841, Thoreau moved into the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson House|Emerson house]].&lt;ref name="Cheever"&gt;Cheever, Susan (2006).

Thoreau returned to Concord and worked in his family's [[pencil]] factory, which he would continue to do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior [[graphite]] by using clay as the binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Pencil.html?id=GZ1CuD619GwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance|last=Petroski|first=Henry|publisher=Knopf|year=1992|isbn=9780679734154|location=New York|pages=104–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention allowed profitable use of a graphite source found in [[New Hampshire]] that had been purchased in 1821 by Thoreau's brother-in-law, Charles Dunbar. The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] in 1795. The company's other source of graphite had been [[Tantiusques]], a mine operated by Native Americans in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the [[electrotyping]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Randall. (Fall 2005).

Once back in Concord, Thoreau went through a restless period. In April 1844 he and his friend Edward Hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of Walden Woods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calliope.org/thoreau/thorotime.html ''A Chronology of Thoreau's Life, with Events of the Times''].

Thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing. In March 1845, Ellery Channing told Thoreau, "Go out upon that, build yourself a hut, &amp; there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive. I see no other alternative, no other hope for you."&lt;ref&gt;Packer, 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Thoreau embarked on a two-year experiment in [[simple living]] on July 4, 1845, when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by Emerson in a [[secondary forest|second-growth forest]] around the shores of [[Walden Pond]]. The house was in "a pretty pasture and woodlot" of {{convert|14|acre|m2}} that Emerson had bought,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson.

[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|Original title page of ''Walden'', with an illustration from a drawing by Thoreau's sister Sophia]]

On July 24 or July 25, 1846, Thoreau ran into the local [[tax collector]], Sam Staples, who asked him to pay six years of delinquent [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]. Thoreau refused because of his opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal. The next day Thoreau was freed when someone, likely to have been his aunt, paid the tax, against his wishes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rosenwald, Lawrence.

In January and February 1848, he delivered lectures on "The Rights and Duties of the Individual in relation to Government",&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, H. D., letter to Ralph Waldo Emerson, February 23, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining his tax resistance at the [[Concord Lyceum]]. Bronson Alcott attended the lecture, writing in his journal on January 26:

{{quote|Heard Thoreau's lecture before the Lyceum on the relation of the individual to the State—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to self-government, and an attentive audience. His allusions to the Mexican War, to Mr. [[Samuel Hoar|Hoar]]'s expulsion from Carolina, his own imprisonment in Concord Jail for refusal to pay his tax, Mr. Hoar's payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal, were all pertinent, well considered, and reasoned. I took great pleasure in this deed of Thoreau's.|Bronson Alcott|''Journals''&lt;ref&gt;Alcott, Bronson (1938). ''Journals''. Boston: Little, Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Resistance to Civil Government]]" (also known as "Civil Disobedience"). It was published by [[Elizabeth Peabody]] in the ''Aesthetic Papers'' in May 1849. Thoreau had taken up a version of [[Percy Shelley]]'s principle in the political poem "[[The Mask of Anarchy]]" (1819), which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |title=Morrissociety.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105232938/http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Walden Pond, Thoreau completed a first draft of ''[[A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers]]'', an [[elegy]] to his brother John, describing their trip to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in 1839. Thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed 1,000 copies at his own expense; fewer than 300 were sold.&lt;ref name="Cheever" /&gt;{{Rp|234}} He self-published the book on the advice of Emerson, using Emerson's publisher, Munroe, who did little to publicize the book.

In August 1846, Thoreau briefly left Walden to make a trip to [[Mount Katahdin]] in [[Maine]], a journey later recorded in "Ktaadn", the first part of ''The Maine Woods''.

Thoreau left Walden Pond on September 6, 1847.&lt;ref name="Cheever" /&gt;{{Rp|244}} At Emerson's request, he immediately moved back to the Emerson house to help Emerson's wife, Lidian, manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |title=Thoreausociety.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129085846/http://thoreausociety.org/_news_abouthdt.htm |archivedate=November 29, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over several years, as he worked to pay off his debts, he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as ''[[Walden|Walden, or Life in the Woods]]'' in 1854, recounting the two years, two months, and two days he had spent at Walden Pond. The book compresses that time into a single calendar year, using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development. Part [[memoir]] and part spiritual quest, ''Walden'' at first won few admirers, but later critics have regarded it as a classic American work that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions.

The American poet [[Robert Frost]] wrote of Thoreau, "In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America."&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Robert (1968). Letter to Wade Van Dore, June 24, 1922, in ''Twentieth Century Interpretations of Walden''. Richard Ruland, ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall. p. 8. {{LCCN|6814480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American author [[John Updike]] said of the book, "A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Updike, John (2004). "A Sage for All Seasons". [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/26/classics ''The Guardian''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau moved out of Emerson's house in July 1848 and stayed at a house on nearby Belknap Street. In 1850, he and his family moved into a house at [[Thoreau-Alcott House|255 Main Street]], where he lived until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene; Carruth, Gorton (1982). ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 45. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau's only travels outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisman|first1=Adam Paul|title=Postcolonialism in North America: Imaginative Colonization in Henry David Thoreau's "A Yankee in Canada" and Jacques Poulin's "Volkswagen Blues"|journal=The Massachusetts Review|date=Autumn 1995|volume=36|issue=3|pages=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is as a result of this trip that he developed lectures that eventually became ''A Yankee in Canada''.

===Later years, 1851–1862===
[[File:VII. Rowse.jpg|thumb|Thoreau in 1854]]
In 1851, Thoreau became increasingly fascinated with [[natural history]] and narratives of travel and expedition. He read avidly on [[botany]] and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal. He admired [[William Bartram]] and [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]]''. He kept detailed observations on Concord's nature lore, recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of Walden Pond and the days certain birds migrated. The point of this task was to "anticipate" the seasons of nature, in his word.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walden.org/documents/file/Library/Thoreau/writings/correspondence/LettersBlake.pdf#page34 Letters to H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;O.

Retrieved November 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[Surveying|land surveyor]] and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town, covering an area of {{convert|26|sqmi|km2}}, in his journal, a two-million-word document he kept for 24 years. He also kept a series of notebooks, and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history, such as "Autumnal Tints", "The Succession of Trees", and "Wild Apples", an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species.

Until the 1970s, literary critics{{Who|date=July 2009}} dismissed Thoreau's late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy. With the rise of [[environmental history]] and [[ecocriticism]] as academic disciplines, several new readings of Thoreau began to emerge, showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorson|first1=Robert M.|title=Walden's Shore: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth-Century Science|date=December 6, 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=067472478X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Primack|first1=Richard B.|title=Tracking Climate Change with the Help of Henry David Thoreau|url=http://www.elsevier.com/connect/tracking-climate-change-with-the-help-of-henry-david-thoreau|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, his late essay "The Succession of Forest Trees" shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction, through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals.

He traveled to [[Canada East]] once, [[Cape Cod]] four times, and Maine three times; these landscapes inspired his "excursion" books, ''[[A Yankee in Canada]]'', ''Cape Cod'', and ''The Maine Woods'', in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography, history and philosophy. Other travels took him southwest to [[Philadelphia]] and New York City in 1854 and west across the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] in 1861, when he visited [[Niagara Falls]], Detroit, Chicago, [[Milwaukee]], [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] and [[Mackinac Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau, Henry David (1970). ''The Annotated Walden''. Philip Van Doren Stern, ed. pp. 96, 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He was provincial in his own travels, but he read widely about travel in other lands. He devoured all the first-hand travel accounts available in his day, at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored. He read [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[James Cook]]; the [[arctic explorer]]s [[John Franklin]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] and [[William Parry (explorer)|William Parry]]; [[David Livingstone]] and [[Richard Francis Burton]] on Africa; [[Lewis and Clark]]; and hundreds of lesser-known works by explorers and literate travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, John Aldrich (1965). ''Thoreau as World Traveler''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples, cultures, religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals. He processed everything he read, in the local laboratory of his Concord experience. Among his famous aphorisms is his advice to "live at home like a traveler."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Correspondence Letters of H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;O.

After [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]], many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from Brown or [[Damn with faint praise|damned him with faint praise]]. Thoreau was disgusted by this, and he composed a key speech, ''[[A Plea for Captain John Brown]]'', which was uncompromising in its defense of Brown and his actions. Thoreau's speech proved persuasive: the abolitionist movement began to accept Brown as a martyr, and by the time of the [[American Civil War]] entire armies of the North were [[John Brown's Body|literally singing Brown's praises]]. As a biographer of Brown put it, "If, as Alfred Kazin suggests, without John Brown there would have been no Civil War, we would add that without the Concord Transcendentalists, John Brown would have had little cultural impact."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, David S. (2005). ''John Brown, Abolitionist''. Knopf. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Thoreau contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau's_Life_and_Writings:_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau,_the_Man About Thoreau: Thoreau, the Man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620045648/http://www.walden.org/Library/About_Thoreau%27s_Life_and_Writings%3A_The_Research_Collections/Thoreau%2C_the_Man |date=June 20, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/wfchron.html Thoreau Chronology].&lt;/ref&gt; His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly ''The Maine Woods'' and [[Excursions (anthology)|''Excursions'']], and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of ''A Week'' and ''Walden''. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, "I did not know we had ever quarreled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last= Critchley|title=The Book of Dead Philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME-6IKs4a2sC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181 |p= 181|location=New York|publisher= Random House |date=2009|isbn=9780307472632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoreau's friend [[William Ellery Channing (poet)|William Ellery Channing]] published his first biography, ''Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist'', in 1873.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Channing and another friend, [[Harrison Blake]], edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics. His memory is honored by the international [[Thoreau Society]] and his legacy honored by the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods, established in 1998 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

===Nature and human existence===
{{quote|Most of the luxuries and many of the so-called comforts of life are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.| Thoreau&lt;ref&gt;''Walden, or Life in the Woods'' (Chapter 1: "Economy")&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and [[canoeing]], of conserving natural resources on private land, and of preserving wilderness as public land. He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], after a ride with him, noted that "Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it." &lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, Passages From the American Note-Books, entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Van Wyck. ''The Flowering of New England''. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated it as a means of self-improvement. He wrote in ''Walden'', "The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth."&lt;ref name="Cheever241"&gt;Cheever, Susan (2006).

[[File:Thoreaus quote near his cabin site, Walden Pond.jpg|thumb|Thoreau's famous quotation, near his cabin site at Walden Pond]]
Thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred "partially cultivated country." His idea of being "far in the recesses of the wilderness" of Maine was to "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [[Roderick Nash]] wrote, "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance."&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Roderick. ''Wilderness and the American Mind: Henry David Thoreau: Philosopher''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Of alcohol, Thoreau wrote, "I would fain keep sober always. ... I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor. ... Of all ebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes?"&lt;ref name="Cheever241" /&gt;

===Sexuality===
Thoreau [[bachelor|never married]] and was [[childless]]. He strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan.

===Politics===
{{Green anarchism |expanded=People}}
[[File:John Brown - Treason broadside, 1859.png|thumb|left|John Brown "Treason" Broadside, 1859]]

Thoreau was fervently against [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and actively supported the abolitionist movement.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; He participated in the [[Underground Railroad]], delivered lectures that attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]], and in opposition to the popular opinion of the time, supported radical abolitionist militia leader [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his party.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Furtak|first=Rick|title=Henry David Thoreau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thoreau/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the ill-fated [[raid on Harpers Ferry]] and in the weeks leading up to Brown's execution, Thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of Concord, Massachusetts, in which he compared the American government to [[Pontius Pilate]] and likened Brown's execution to the [[crucifixion of Jesus Christ]]:

{{quote|Some eighteen hundred years ago Christ was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung. These are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is not Old Brown any longer; he is an angel of light.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

In ''[[The Last Days of John Brown]]'', Thoreau described the words and deeds of John Brown as noble and an example of heroism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Last Days of John Brown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed Brown and his scheme as "crazy".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Thoreau was a proponent of [[limited government]] and [[individualism]]. Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the kind of government which "governs not at all", he distanced himself from contemporary "no-government men" ([[anarchists]]), writing: "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

Thoreau deemed the evolution from [[absolute monarchy]] to [[limited monarchy]] to [[democracy]] as "a progress toward true respect for the individual" and theorized about further improvements "towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt; Echoing this belief, he went on to write: "There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly."&lt;ref name="resistance" /&gt;

It is on this basis that Thoreau could so strongly inveigh against British and Catholic power in ''A Yankee in Canada''. Despotic authority had crushed the people's sense of ingenuity and enterprise; the Canadian ''habitants'' had been reduced, in his view, to a perpetual childlike state. Ignoring the recent Rebellions, he argued that there would be no revolution in the St. Lawrence River valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thoreau|first1=Henry David|title=A Yankee in Canada|date=1961|publisher=Harvest House|location=Montreal|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Although Thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent (exemplified in his support for John Brown) and nonviolent (his own example of [[tax resistance]] displayed in ''Resistance to Civil Government''), he regarded [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[nonresistance]] as temptation to passivity,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau:_The_Digital_Collection/Essays The Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222023007/http://www.walden.org/Library/The_Writings_of_Henry_David_Thoreau%3A_The_Digital_Collection/Essays |date=December 22, 2010 }} from the Writings of Henry David Thoreau: The Digital Collection&lt;/ref&gt; writing: "Let not our Peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords, or our inability to draw them from their scabbards; but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp."&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Furthermore, in a formal lyceum debate in 1841, he debated the subject "Is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance?", arguing the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoreau.eserver.org/mjf/MJF1.html Transcendental Ethos] from The Thoreau Reader&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, his condemnation of the [[Mexican–American War]] did not stem from pacifism, but rather because he considered Mexico "unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army" as a means to expand the slave territory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Thoreau was [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] towards [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]]. On one hand he regarded commerce as "unexpectedly confident and serene, adventurous, and unwearied"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; and expressed admiration for its associated [[cosmopolitanism]], writing:

{{quote|I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England heads the next summer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

On the other hand, he wrote disparagingly of the factory system:

{{quote|I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

Thoreau also favored [[bioregionalism]], the protection of animals and wild areas, [[free trade]], and taxation for schools and highways.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; He disapproved of the subjugation of Native Americans, slavery, [[technological utopianism]], [[consumerism]], [[philistinism]], mass entertainment, and frivolous applications of technology.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

===Intellectual interests, influences, and affinities===

====Indian sacred texts and philosophy====
Thoreau was influenced by [[Hindu texts|Indian spiritual thought]]. In ''Walden'', there are many overt references to the sacred texts of India. For example, in the first chapter ("Economy"), he writes: "How much more admirable the [[Bhagvat-geeta|Bhagvat-Geeta]] than all the ruins of the East!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; ''American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia'' classes him as one of several figures who "took a more [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or [[Pandeism|pandeist]] approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia |author = [[John Lachs]] and [[Robert Talisse]] |date = 2007 |isbn = 0415939267 |page = 310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also a characteristic of Hinduism.

Furthermore, in "The Pond in Winter", he equates Walden Pond with the sacred [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges river]], writing:

[[File:Bhagavata Gita Bishnupur Arnab Dutta 2011.JPG|thumb|right|Krishna teaching Arjuna from ''[[Bhagavata Gita]], ''a text Thoreau read at Walden Pond ]]

{{quote|In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;}}

Thoreau was aware his Ganges imagery could have been factual. He wrote about ice harvesting at Walden Pond. And he knew that New England's [[Ice trade|ice merchants]] were shipping ice to foreign ports, including [[Calcutta]].

Additionally, Thoreau followed various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] customs, including following a [[Rice diet|diet of rice]] ("It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;), [[Flute-playing|flute playing]] (reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of [[Krishna]]), and [[yoga]].

In an 1849 letter to his friend H.G.O. Blake, he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him:

{{quote|Free in this world as the birds in the air, disengaged from every kind of chains, those who practice yoga gather in Brahma the certain fruits of their works. Depend upon it that, rude and careless as I am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Divine forms traverse him without tearing him, and united to the nature which is proper to him, he goes, he acts as animating original matter. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Barbara S. "Why Did Henry David Thoreau Take the Bhagavad-Gita to Walden Pond?" ''Parabola'' 12.1 (Spring 1986): 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Biology====
[[File:Eggs BSNH 1930.png|thumb|right|Bird eggs found by Thoreau and given to the [[Boston Society of Natural History]]. Those in the nest are of [[yellow warbler]], the other two of [[red-tailed hawk]].]]
Thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology, including the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Asa Gray]] (Charles Darwin's staunchest American ally).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thoreau was deeply influenced by Humboldt, especially his work [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, Andrea. ''The Invention of Nature: Alexander Humboldt's New World''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Thoreau purchased and read Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Unlike many natural historians at the time, including [[Louis Agassiz]] who publicly opposed Darwinism in favor of a static view of nature, Thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of [[evolution by natural selection]] and endorsed it,&lt;ref&gt;Cain, William E. ''A Historical Guide to Henry David Thoreau''. {{ISBN|0195138635}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

{{quote|1=The development theory implies a greater vital force in Nature, because it is more flexible and accommodating, and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation. (A quote from ''On the Origin of Species'' follows this sentence.)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Berger, Michael Benjamin. ''Thoreau's Late Career and The Dispersion of Seeds: The Saunterer's Synoptic Vision''. {{ISBN|157113168X}}, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Influence==
[[File:ThoreauBust.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Thoreau from the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] at the [[Bronx Community College]]]]

{{quote|text=Thoreau's careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time, becoming stronger as the weaknesses Thoreau noted have become more pronounced ... Events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at Walden Pond have been influenced by it, including the national park system, the British labor movement, the creation of India, the civil rights movement, the hippie revolution, the environmental movement, and the wilderness movement.

Thoreau's political writings had little impact during his lifetime, as "his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical," viewing him instead as a naturalist. They either dismissed or ignored his political essays, including ''Civil Disobedience''. The only two complete books (as opposed to essays) published in his lifetime, ''Walden'' and ''A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers'' (1849), both dealt with nature, in which he loved to wander."&lt;ref name=McElroy/&gt; His obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an 1862 yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|date=1863|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|location=New York|page=666|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n673/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thoreau's writings went on to influence many public figures. Political leaders and reformers like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Russian (citizen)|Russian]] author [[Leo Tolstoy]] all spoke of being strongly affected by Thoreau's work, particularly ''Civil Disobedience'', as did "[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] theorist [[Frank Chodorov]] [who] devoted an entire issue of his monthly, ''Analysis'', to an appreciation of Thoreau."&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

Thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including [[Edward Abbey]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Upton Sinclair]],&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, W. Barksdale, ''Walden Pond: A History''. Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. B.

''A Complex Fate: Gustav Stickley and the Craftsman Movement''. Preservation Press, 1996. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau also influenced naturalists like [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Edwin Way Teale]], [[Joseph Wood Krutch]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[David Brower]], and [[Loren Eiseley]], whom ''Publishers Weekly'' called "the modern Thoreau".&lt;ref&gt;Kifer, Ken ''[http://www.kenkifer.com/Thoreau/ Analysis and Notes on Walden: Henry Thoreau's Text with Adjacent Thoreauvian Commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318110150/http://www.kenkifer.com/Thoreau/ |date=March 18, 2006 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; English writer [[Henry Stephens Salt]] wrote a biography of Thoreau in 1890, which popularized Thoreau's ideas in Britain: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Edward Carpenter]], and [[Robert Blatchford]] were among those who became Thoreau enthusiasts as a result of Salt's advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrick, George and Oehlschlaeger, Fritz (eds.) ''Toward the Making of Thoreau's Modern Reputation'', University of Illinois Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohandas Gandhi first read ''Walden'' in 1906 while working as a civil rights activist in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. He first read ''Civil Disobedience'' "while he sat in a South African prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the Indian population in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The essay galvanized Gandhi, who wrote and published a synopsis of Thoreau's argument, calling its 'incisive logic ... unanswerable' and referring to Thoreau as 'one of the greatest and most moral men America has produced'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]] (2011-05-04) [https://mises.org/daily/5250/Here-the-State-Is-Nowhere-to-Be-Seen Here, the State Is Nowhere to Be Seen], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Although he was practicing civil disobedience before he read Thoreau's essay, Gandhi was quick to point out the debt he owed to Thoreau and other thinkers like him".Shawn Chandler Bingham, ''Thoreau and the sociological imagination : the wilds of society''. Lanham, Md. : Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2008. {{ISBN|9780742560581}} p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He told American reporter [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], "[Thoreau's] ideas influenced me greatly. I adopted some of them and recommended the study of Thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of Indian Independence. Why I actually took the name of my movement from Thoreau's essay 'On the Duty of Civil Disobedience', written about 80&amp;nbsp;years ago."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Webb. I Found No Peace. Garden City, 1938. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading "On Civil Disobedience" in 1944 while attending [[Morehouse College]]. He wrote in his autobiography that it was,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.&lt;ref&gt;King, M.L.

American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Thoreau's ''Walden'' with him in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''A Matter of Consequences''&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1945, wrote ''[[Walden Two]]'', a fictional utopia about 1,000 members of a community living together inspired by the life of Thoreau.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F., ''Walden Two'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Thoreau and his fellow [[Transcendentalists]] from [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] were a major inspiration of the composer [[Charles Ives]].

For the 200th anniversary of his birth, publishers released several new editions of his work: a recreation of ''Walden''{{'s}} 1902 edition with illustrations, a picture book with excerpts from ''Walden'', and an annotated collection of Thoreau's essays on slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Williams |first1=John |title=Alcoholism in America |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2017-07-07 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/books/review/alcoholism-in-america.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Thoreau on May 23, 2017 in Concord, MA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stamps.org/US-New-Issues-2017|title=American Philatelic Society|website=stamps.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Although his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded. Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of "unmanly" [[effeminacy]] and "womanish solitude", while deeming him a self-indulgent "skulker".&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Robert Louis. [http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html "Henry David Thoreau: His Character and Opinions"]. Cornhill Magazine. June 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that "He is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness." &lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, ''Passages From the American Note-Books'', entry for September 2, 1842.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau "repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men".&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, ''The Heart of Hawthorne's Journals'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borst, Raymond R. ''The Thoreau Log: A Documentary Life of Henry David Thoreau, 1817–1862.'' New York: G.K. Hall, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the "wicked" and "heathenish" message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to "lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs".&lt;ref&gt;Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:
{{quote|text=People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New England Quarterly]]'', Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec., 1933), pp. 733–46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work ''Walden'' by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:

{{quote|text=I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. ... Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; ... I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy, and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=neworker1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |title=Henry David Thoreau, Hypocrite |last1=Schultz |first1=Kathryn |date=October 19, 2015 |work=The New Yorker |access-date=October 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019170355/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |archivedate=October 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.&lt;ref name=medium1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@TheNewThoreau/why-do-we-love-thoreau-because-he-was-right-175251814c |title=Why do we love Thoreau?

'''Latent heat''' is thermal energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process — usually a [[Phase_transition#Modern_classifications|first-order phase transition]].

Latent heat can be understood as heat energy in hidden form which is supplied or extracted to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. Examples are [[latent heat of fusion]] and [[latent heat of vaporization]] involved in [[Phase transition|phase changes]], i.e. a substance condensing or vaporizing at a specified temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was introduced around 1762 by [[Great Britain|British]] [[chemist]] [[Joseph Black]]. It is derived from the Latin ''latere'' (''to lie hidden''). Black used the term in the context of [[calorimetry]] where a heat transfer caused a volume change in a body while its temperature was constant.

In contrast to latent heat, [[sensible heat]] is a heat transfer that results in a temperature change in a body.

==Usage==
The terms ″sensible heat″ and ″latent heat″ refer to types of heat transfer between a body and its surroundings;  they depend on the properties of the body. ″Sensible heat″ is ″sensed″ or felt in a process as a change in the body's temperature. ″Latent heat″ is heat transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change ( solid / liquid / gas ).  

Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transfer of energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric or ocean water,  [[vaporization]], [[condensation]], [[freezing]] or [[melting]], whereas sensible heat is energy transferred that is evident in change of the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean, or ice, without those phase changes, though it is associated with changes of pressure and volume.

The original usage of the term, as introduced by Black, was applied to systems that were intentionally held at constant temperature. Such usage referred to ''latent heat of expansion'' and several other related latent heats. These latent heats are defined independently of the conceptual framework of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907). ''Thermodynamics. An Introductory Treatise dealing mainly with First Principles and their Direct Applications'', B.G. Tuebner, Leipzig, pages 9, 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to volume'' or ''latent heat of expansion'', or increase its pressure by an amount described by its ''latent heat with respect to pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C. (1872). ''Theory of Heat'', third edition, Longmans, Green, and Co., London, page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Latent heat''' is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a [[thermodynamic system]], during a constant-temperature process.
Two common forms of latent heat are [[enthalpy of fusion|latent heat of fusion]] ([[melting]]) and [[enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] ([[boiling]]).  These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas.

In both cases the change is [[endothermic]], meaning that the system absorbs energy.
For example, when water evaporates, energy is required for the water molecules to overcome the forces of attraction between them, the transition from water to vapor requires an input of energy.

If the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface, then the vapor's latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid's [[sensible heat]] onto the surface.

The large value of the [[enthalpy]] of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous.

===Meteorology===
In [[meteorology]], latent heat flux is the [[flux]] of heat from the Earth's surface to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that is associated with [[evaporation]] or [[transpiration]] of water at the surface and subsequent [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] in the [[troposphere]]. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget.  Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the [[Bowen ratio]] technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the [[eddy covariance|Jonathan]] [[eddy covariance|Beaver]] method.

==History==
The English word ''[[wikt:latent#English|latent]]'' comes from Latin ''[[wikt:latens#Latin|latēns]]'', meaning ''lying hidden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|latent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Charlton T. (1890). ''An Elementary Latin Dictionary''. Entry for [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dlatens latens].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''latent heat'' was introduced into calorimetry around 1750 when [[Joseph Black]], commissioned by producers of [[Scotch whisky]] in search of ideal quantities of fuel and water for their distilling process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= Credit Where It's Due | url           = | accessdate= | series= The Day the Universe Changed | serieslink= The Day the Universe Changed | credits= [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] | network= BBC | date= 1979 | number = 6  | time=50 (34 minutes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to studying system changes, such as of volume and pressure, when the thermodynamic system was held at constant temperature in a thermal bath. [[James Prescott Joule]] characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|publisher=The Physical Society of London
|page=274
|quote=I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,&amp;mdash;that in some instances, particularly in the case of sensible heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of latent heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space.
}}, Lecture on Matter, Living Force, and Heat. May 5 and 12, 1847&lt;/ref&gt; relating the latter to [[thermal energy]].

==Specific latent heat==
A ''specific'' latent heat (''L'') expresses the amount of energy in the form of heat (''Q'') required to completely effect a phase change of a unit of mass (''m''), usually {{gaps|1|kg}}, of a substance as an [[intensive property]]:
:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac {Q}{m}.&lt;/math&gt;
Intensive properties are material characteristics and are not dependent on the size or extent of the sample. Commonly quoted and tabulated in the literature are the specific latent heat of fusion and the specific latent heat of vaporization for many substances.

From this definition, the latent heat for a given mass of a substance is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = {m}  {L}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''Q'' is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of the substance (in [[kilojoule|kJ]] or in [[BTU]]),
:''m'' is the mass of the substance (in [[kg]] or in [[Pound (mass)|lb]]), and
:''L'' is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or in BTU lb&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), either ''L''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; for fusion, or ''L''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; for vaporization.

==Specific latent heat for condensation of water in clouds==
&lt;!-- Is this dependant on pressure ? - --&gt;
The specific latent heat of condensation of water in the temperature range from −25&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C is approximated by the following empirical cubic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{water}(T) = (2500.8 - 2.36 T + 0.0016 T^2 - 0.00006 T^3)~\text{J/g},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"&gt;[[Curve fitting#Fitting lines and polynomial curves to data points|Polynomial curve fit]]s to Table 2.1. {{cite book |author1=R. R. Rogers |author2=M. K. Yau |title=A Short Course in Cloud Physics |edition=3rd |year=1989 |publisher=Pergamon Press |isbn=0-7506-3215-1 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where the temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the numerical value in °C.

For [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and [[deposition (physics)|deposition]] from and into ice, the specific latent heat is almost constant in the temperature range from −40&amp;nbsp;°C to 0&amp;nbsp;°C and can be approximated by the following empirical quadratic function:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{ice}(T) = (2834.1 - 0.29 T - 0.004 T^2)~\text{J/g}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RYfit"/&gt;

==Variation with temperature (or pressure)==

[[Image:Heat of Vaporization (Benzene+Acetone+Methanol+Water).png|thumb|280px|Temperature-dependency of the heats of vaporization for water, methanol, benzene, and acetone.]]
As the temperature (or pressure) rises to the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] the LHOV falls to zero :

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">[[File:Light clay infill.JPG|thumb|Example use of light clay within a timber frame before rendering]]'''Light clay''' (also '''light straw clay''', '''light clay straw''', '''slipstraw''') is a natural building material used to infill between a wooden frame in a [[timber framing|timber framed]] building using a combination of [[clay]] and [[straw]], [[woodchips]] or some other lighter material.

==History==
A mixture of clay and straw was used as an infill material for [[timber framing|timber framed]] building from at least the 12th century in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/clay.html|title=An Introduction to Traditional and Modern German Clay Building|quote=Building with clay has a long tradition in Germany and other European countries. Framed structures (half-timbered houses) from the 12th century, filled with a mixture of clay and straw fibers, still exist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewed interest in traditional building methods developed from the 1980s after which various [[natural building]] architects and builders started promoting the use of light clay.&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=054_i8KdcCAC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=%22light+clay%22+natural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4VzMTspw_L&amp;sig=QrHVmnQrZZJNMYHs0fG7N6Lr6K8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Izy8TaLtJ5CwhQetk8HRBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22light%20clay%22%20natural&amp;f=false|title=The art of natural building: design, construction, resources|pages=165–170|isbn=978-0-86571-433-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Light clay mix.JPG|thumb|right|Light clay mixture consisting of clay, water and straw before application]]
Local clay, often local subsoil, is mixed into a slurry with water and then combined with straw or wood chip or other similar material. Wood chips can vary in size from [[sawdust]] to chip 5cm in diameter.&lt;ref name=art/&gt; The ratio of clay to other ingredients can be adapted to either increase thermal mass or insulation properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=light+clay+natural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvmhvLrYCH&amp;sig=PJh5g60hsMTPX0MrxqqmK-lATBY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0z-8Ta2KOMOLhQfa0dTJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=light%20clay%20natural&amp;f=false|title=The natural house: a complete guide to healthy, energy-efficient|page=250|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture is provided with additional structural strength using [[Wattle and daub|wattles]].

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km. One [[megaparsec]] (Mpc) is equivalent to one million [[parsec]]s.}}) the Universe becomes homogeneous meaning that all its parts have on average the same density, composition and structure.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Kirshner, Robert P. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=978-0-691-05862-7 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there is believed to be no "center" or "edge" of the Universe, there is no particular reference point with which to plot the overall location of the Earth in the universe.&lt;ref name="Klaus2002"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Little Book of Time |author1=Mainzer, Klaus |author2=Eisinger, J. |isbn=978-0-387-95288-8 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wX111YnexSUC&amp;pg=PA55|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[observable universe]] is defined as that region of the Universe visible to terrestrial observers, Earth is, by definition, the center of Earth's observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Liddle, Andrew R. |author2=Lyth, David Hilary |title=Cosmological inflation and large-scale structure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmWauPZSovMC&amp;pg=PA24|date= 2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-57598-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reference can be made to the Earth's position with respect to specific structures, which exist at various scales. It is still undetermined whether the Universe is [[Infinity|infinite]]. There have been numerous hypotheses that our universe may be only one such example within a higher [[multiverse]]; however, no direct evidence of any sort of multiverse has ever been observed, and some have argued that the hypothesis is not [[falsifiable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Reasons We May Live in a Multiverse |url=http://www.space.com/18811-multiple-universes-5-theories.html |author= Moskowitz, Clara|publisher=space.com|year=2012|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00033790903047725| title = Contemporary History of Cosmology and the Controversy over the Multiverse| journal = Annals of Science| volume = 66| issue = 4| pages = 529–551| year = 2009| last1 = Kragh | first1 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''naturalism''' is the "idea or belief that only [[Physical law|natural]] (as opposed to [[supernatural]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]]) laws and forces operate in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/125337?redirectedFrom=naturalism naturalism]&lt;/ref&gt;  Adherents of naturalism (''i.e.'', naturalists) assert that natural laws are the rules that govern the structure and behavior of the natural universe, that the changing [[universe]] at every stage is a product of these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10713a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Naturalism|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=6 March 2012|quote=Naturalism is not so much a special system as a point of view or tendency common to a number of philosophical and religious systems; not so much a well-defined set of positive and negative doctrines as an attitude or spirit pervading and influencing many doctrines. As the name implies, this tendency consists essentially in looking upon nature as the one original and fundamental source of all that exists, and in attempting to explain everything in terms of nature. Either the limits of nature are also the limits of existing reality, or at least the first cause, [[cosmological argument|if its existence is found necessary]], has nothing to do with the working of natural agencies. All events, therefore, find their adequate explanation within nature itself. But, as the terms nature and natural are themselves used in more than one sense, the term naturalism is also far from having one fixed meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Naturalism can intuitively be separated into an [[ontological]] and a [[methodological]] component," argues David Papineau.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/|title=Naturalism|last=Papineau|first=David|authorlink=David Papineau|date=22 February 2007|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ontological" refers to the philosophical study of the nature of reality. Some philosophers equate naturalism with [[materialism]]. For example, philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] argues that nature is best accounted for by reference to [[Matter|material]] principles. These principles include [[mass]], [[energy]], and other [[Physical property|physical]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] accepted by the [[scientific community]]. Further, this sense of naturalism holds that [[Spirit|spirits]], [[Deity|deities]], and [[Ghost|ghosts]] are not real and that there is no "[[Teleology|purpose]]" in nature. Such an absolute belief in naturalism is commonly referred to as ''[[metaphysical naturalism]]''.&lt;ref name="KurtzDistinction"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kurtz, Paul|authorlink=Paul Kurtz|date=Spring 1998|title=Darwin Re-Crucified: Why Are So Many Afraid of Naturalism?|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/kurtz_18_2.html|journal=[[Free Inquiry]]|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming naturalism in working methods as the current paradigm, without the further consideration of naturalism as an absolute truth with philosophical entailment, is called ''[[methodological naturalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html|title=Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science|last=Schafersman|first=Steven D.|authorlink=Steven Schafersman|year=1996|quote=Methodological naturalism is the adoption or assumption of naturalism in scientific belief and practice without really believing in naturalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject matter here is a philosophy of acquiring knowledge based on an assumed paradigm.

With the exception of [[Pantheism|pantheists]]—who believe that Nature is identical with divinity while not recognizing a distinct personal anthropomorphic god—[[Theism|theists]] challenge the idea that nature contains all of reality. According to some theists, natural laws may be viewed as so-called [[Secondary causation|secondary causes]] of God(s).

In the 20th century, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[George Santayana]], and other philosophers argued that the success of naturalism in science meant that scientific methods should also be used in philosophy. Science and philosophy are said to form a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], according to this view.

== Origins and history ==
{{main|History of metaphysical naturalism}}
The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011). URL:http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511570797&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
The term "[[methodological naturalism]]" is much more recent though. According to [[Ronald Numbers]], it was coined in 1983 by Paul de Vries, a [[Wheaton College, Illinois|Wheaton College]] philosopher. De Vries distinguished between what he called "methodological naturalism," a disciplinary method that says nothing about God's existence, and "metaphysical naturalism," which "denies the existence of a transcendent God."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Matzke]]: [http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/03/on_the_origins.html On the Origins of Methodological Naturalism]. ''The Pandas Thumb'' (March 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "methodological naturalism" had been used in 1937 by [[Edgar S. Brightman]] in an article in ''The Philosophical Review'' as a contrast to "naturalism" in general, but there the idea was not really developed to its more recent distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/archive/asa/200603/0501.html|title=ASA March 2006 – Re: Methodological Naturalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that; 
# Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]];  
# Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]].

Or, as [[Carl Sagan]] succinctly put it: "''The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition [[Arthur C. Danto]] states that Naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions needed for science from naturalism==

According to [[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn]], all science is based on an approved agenda of unprovable assumptions about the character of the universe, rather than merely on empirical facts. These assumptions—a paradigm—comprise a collection of beliefs, values and techniques that are held by a given scientific community, which legitimize their systems and set the limitations to their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p98831/pdf/ch0615.pdf|title=Chapter 6, The Privileged Status of Science |first=Lee|last=Boldman|year=2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alfred North Whitehead]] wrote, "All science must start with some assumptions as to the ultimate analysis of the facts with which it deals.  These assumptions are justified partly by their adherence to the types of occurrence of which we are directly conscious, and partly by their success in representing the observed facts with a certain generality, devoid of ''ad hoc'' suppositions."{{sfn|Whitehead|1997|p=135}}  Priddy notes that all scientific study inescapably builds on at least some essential assumptions that are untested by scientific processes.&lt;ref name="Priddy 1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://robertpriddy.com/lim/5.html |chapter=Chapter Five, Scientific Objectivity in Question  |title=Science Limited |first=Robert |last=Priddy  |year=1998|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For naturalists, nature is the only reality.  There is no such thing as 'supernatural'.  The scientific method is to be used to investigate all reality, including the human spirit: "The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily... reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalism is the implicit philosophy of working scientists, that the following basic assumptions are needed to justify the scientific method:{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}

#''that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers''.{{sfn|Heilbron|2003|p=vii}}{{sfn|Chen|2009|pp =1-2}} "The basis for rationality is acceptance of an external objective reality."{{sfn|Durak|2008|p=}} "Objective reality is clearly an essential thing if we are to develop a meaningful perspective of the world. Nevertheless its very existence is assumed."&lt;ref&gt;

== Metaphysical naturalism ==
{{Main|Metaphysical naturalism}}
Metaphysical naturalism, also called "ontological naturalism" and "philosophical naturalism", is a philosophical worldview and belief system that holds that there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]], i.e., those required to understand our physical environment by [[mathematical modeling]].  Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers exclusively to the methodology of science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Metaphysical naturalism holds that all properties related to [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] are reducible to, or [[supervene]] upon, nature. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or spiritual naturalism.  More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Methodological naturalism&lt;!--'Methodological naturalism' redirects here--&gt; ==
{{further|Alternatives to natural selection}}

'''Methodological naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; concerns itself with methods of learning what nature is. These methods are useful in the evaluation of claims about existence and knowledge  and in identifying causal mechanisms responsible for the emergence of physical phenomena.  It attempts to explain and test scientific endeavors, hypotheses, and events with reference to natural causes and events. This second sense of the term "naturalism" seeks to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature.  Methodological naturalism is a way of acquiring knowledge. It is a distinct system of thought concerned with a cognitive approach to reality, and is thus a [[epistemology|philosophy of knowledge]]. Studies by sociologist [[Elaine Howard Ecklund|Elaine Ecklund]] suggest that religious scientists in practice apply methodological naturalism. They report that their religious beliefs affect the way they think about the implications - often moral - of their work, but not the way they practice science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think|first=Elaine Howard|last=Ecklund|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195392982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles and books from 1996 onward, [[Robert T. Pennock]] wrote using the term "methodological naturalism" to clarify that the [[scientific method]] confines itself to natural explanations without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and is not based on dogmatic [[metaphysical naturalism]] (as claimed by [[creationism|creationists]] and proponents of [[intelligent design]], in particular by [[Phillip E. Johnson]]). Pennock's testimony as an expert witness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day3am2.html|title=Kitzmiller v. Dover: Day 3, AM: Robert Pennock (continued)|website=www.talkorigins.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial was cited by the Judge in his ''Memorandum Opinion'' concluding that "Methodological naturalism is a 'ground rule' of science today":&lt;ref name=kitz&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#4. Whether ID is Science | Kitzmiller v. Dover: Whether ID is Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Expert testimony reveals that since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited to the search for natural causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science." Methodological naturalism is thus "a paradigm of science." It is a "ground rule" that "requires scientists to seek explanations in the world around us based upon what we can observe, test, replicate, and verify.&lt;ref&gt;
Judge John E. Jones, III [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover_decision2.html Decision of the Court] Expert witnesses were [[John F. Haught]], [[Robert T. Pennock]], and [[Kenneth R. Miller]].  Links in the original to specific testimony records have been deleted here.

=== Alvin Plantinga ===
[[Alvin Plantinga]], Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], and a [[Christian]], has become a well-known critic of naturalism.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002p9"&gt;{{cite book |first= J.K. |last= Beilby |year= 2002 |title= Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series= G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |publisher= Cornell University Press |isbn= 9780801487637 |lccn= 2001006111 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PR9 |page= ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}  He suggests, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism |reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless the evolution of humans was guided (for example, by God).  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title= Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Alvin |last= Plantinga |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title= Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher= The Chronicle of Higher Education |date= 11 April 2010 |quote= ...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe. But of course it doesn't even begin to follow that I think the scientific theory of evolution is false. And I don't.}}

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[Evil demon]] or [[Brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;

{{quotation|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities - no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another - and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.|Alvin Plantinga|Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism|"Introduction"&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;}}

=== Robert T. Pennock ===
[[Robert T. Pennock]] contends&lt;ref name=lettuce&gt;[[Robert T. Pennock]], [http://www.msu.edu/~pennock5/research/papers/Pennock_SupNatExpl.html Supernaturalist Explanations and the Prospects for a Theistic Science or "How do you know it was the lettuce?"]&lt;/ref&gt; that as [[supernatural]] agents and powers "are above and beyond the natural world and its agents and powers" and "are not constrained by natural laws", only logical impossibilities constrain what a supernatural agent could not do. He states: "If we could apply natural knowledge to understand supernatural powers, then, by definition, they would not be supernatural". As the supernatural is necessarily a mystery to us, it can provide no grounds on which to judge scientific models. "Experimentation requires observation and control of the variables.... But by definition we have no control over supernatural entities or forces." Science does not deal with meanings; the closed system of scientific reasoning cannot be used to define itself. Allowing science to appeal to untestable supernatural powers would make the scientist's task meaningless, undermine the discipline that allows science to make progress, and "would be as profoundly unsatisfying as the ancient Greek playwright's reliance upon the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to extract his hero from a difficult predicament."

Naturalism of this sort says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, anything that can be scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.

=== W. V. O. Quine ===
{{main|Naturalized epistemology}}
[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] describes naturalism as the position that there is no higher tribunal for truth than natural science itself. In his view, there is no better method than the scientific method for judging the claims of science, and there is neither any need nor any place for a "first philosophy", such as (abstract) [[metaphysics]] or [[epistemology]], that could stand behind and justify science or the scientific method.

Therefore, philosophy should feel free to make use of the findings of scientists in its own pursuit, while also feeling free to offer criticism when those claims are ungrounded, confused, or inconsistent. In Quine's view, philosophy is "continuous with" science and ''both'' are empirical.&lt;ref name=Rudder&gt;{{cite book |title=Naturalism and the First-Person Perspective |author=Lynne Rudder |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9G_bIWzgjFkC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |isbn=0199914745 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalism is not a dogmatic belief that the modern view of science is entirely correct. Instead, it simply holds that science is the best way to explore the processes of the universe and that those processes are what modern science is striving to understand.  However, this Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters among philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Feldman |first= Richard |editor-first= Edward N.
|editor-last= Zalta |editor-link= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|title= Naturalized Epistemology |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ |accessdate= 2014-06-04 |edition= Summer 2012 |year= 2012 |quote= Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karl Popper ===
[[Karl Popper]] equated naturalism with [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] theory of science. He rejected it based on his general critique of induction (see [[problem of induction]]), yet acknowledged its utility as means for inventing conjectures.
{{quotation|A naturalistic methodology (sometimes called an "inductive theory of science") has its value, no doubt....  I reject the naturalistic view: It is uncritical. Its upholders fail to notice that whenever they believe to have discovered a fact, they have only proposed a convention. Hence the convention is liable to turn into a dogma. This criticism of the naturalistic view applies not only to its criterion of meaning, but also to its idea of science, and consequently to its idea of empirical method.|Karl R. Popper|''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''|(Routledge, 2002), pp. 52–53, {{ISBN|0-415-27844-9}}.}}
Popper instead proposed that science should adopt a methodology based on [[falsifiability]] for [[demarcation problem|demarcation]], because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a single experiment can contradict one.  Popper holds that scientific theories are characterized by falsifiability.

'''Naturalistic observation''' is, in contrast to [[analog observation]], a research tool in which a subject is observed in its [[natural habitat]] without any manipulation by the observer.&lt;ref name=KCherry&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |title=What Is Naturalistic Observation? |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/nindex/g/naturalistic.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Psychology 202Q Lab: Naturalistic Observation |url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ps202vc/PDF/NaturalisticObservation.pdf |publisher=[[University of Connecticut]] |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During naturalistic observation, researchers take great care to avoid interfering with the behavior they are observing by using [[Unobtrusive research|unobtrusive]] methods.&lt;ref name=NatObs&gt;{{cite web |title=Naturalistic Observation |publisher=radford.edu |url=http://www.radford.edu/~tpierce/201%20files/201%20handouts/Naturalistic%20Observationl%20ecture%20notes.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalistic observation involves two main differences that set it apart from other forms of data gathering. In the context of a naturalistic observation, the environment is in no way being manipulated by the observer nor was it created by the observer.&lt;ref name=NatObs/&gt;

Naturalistic observation, as a research tool, comes with both advantages and disadvantages that impact its application. By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation is used in many techniques, from watching an animal's eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/RMPA/naturalisticobservation.html|title=Naturalistic Observation|website=peace.saumag.edu|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nature center''' (or '''nature centre''') is an organization with a [[visitor center]] or [[interpretive center]] designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected [[Open space reserve|open space]], nature centers often have trails through their property.  Some are located within a state or city [[park]], and some have special [[garden]]s or an [[arboretum]].  Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries.  Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as [[reptile]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, or [[fish]].  There are often museum exhibits and displays about [[natural history]], or preserved mounted animals or nature [[dioramas]].   Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer [[naturalists]] and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs.

Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses.  They usually rely on support from dedicated [[volunteering|volunteers]].

[[Environmental education]] centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds.

Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, [[dioramas]] and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a [[park ranger]].

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity).

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Qualities ==
[[File:Rammed earth wall surface.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the surface of a rammed-earth wall: apart from the patches of damage, the surface shows regular horizontal lines caused by the wooden [[formwork]] and subtler horizontal strata from successive courses.]]

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Revolving rivers''' are a surprising, uncommon way of [[sand]] pile growth that can be found in a few sands around the world, but has been studied in detail only for one [[Cuba]]n sand from a place called Santa Teresa ([[Pinar del Rio]] province).

==Description==

When pouring "revolving" sand on a flat surface from a fixed position, the growth of a conical pile does not occur by the common [[avalanche]] mechanism, where sand slides down the pile in a more or less random fashion. What happens in that a relatively thin "river" of flowing sand travels from the pouring point at the apex of the pile to its base, while the rest of the sand at the surface is static. In addition, the river "revolves" around the pile either in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions (looking from top) depending on the initial conditions of the experiment. Actually the river constitutes the "cutting edge" of a layer of sand that deposits as a helix on the conical pile, and makes it grow.
For small sandpiles, rivers are continuous, but they become intermittent
for larger piles.

== History and state of the art ==

The phenomenon was observed first by E. Altshuler at the [[University of Havana]] in 1995, but at the time he assumed that it was well known, and temporarily forgot about it. In 2000, being at the [[University of Houston]], he told K. E. Bassler, who showed a vivid interest in the matter. Embarrassingly enough, Altshuler was unable to demonstrate it before Bassler using a random sand from Houston, so he had to send him a video from [[Cuba]] after his return to the island.

Once the existence of the strange phenomenon was confirmed for everyone, E. Altshuler and a number of collaborators performed a systematic study in [[Havana]], which was then jointly published with Bassler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=

Further work has been done to understand in more detail the
phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=

However, the connection between the physical, chemical (and possibly biological) properties of the grains in a specific sand, the nature of the inter-grain interactions, and the emergence of the revolving rivers is still an open question.

Sand from Santa Teresa is made of almost pure [[silicon dioxide]] grains with an average [[grain size]] of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm approximately and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But in spite of its apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one batch of sand may stop showing revolving rivers (just as [[singing sand]] eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=YouTubeRiosEng| author=Complexperiments |date=2010 |

'''Scotlandite''' is a [[sulfite]] mineral first discovered in a mine at [[Leadhills#Mining|Leadhills]] in [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]], an area known to [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] and [[geologist]]s for its wide range of different mineral species found in the veins that lie deep in the mine shafts. This specific mineral is found in the Susanna vein of [[Leadhills]], where the crystals are formed as chisel-shaped or bladed.&lt;ref name=earthwise /&gt; Scotlandite was actually the first naturally occurring [[sulfite]], which has the ideal chemical formula of [[Lead|Pb]][[Sulfur|S]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The mineral has been approved by the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names, IMA, to be named scotlandite for Scotland.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scotlandite is found in association with [[pyromorphite]], [[anglesite]], [[lanarkite]], [[leadhillite]], [[susannite]], and [[barite]]. It occurs in cavities in massive [[barite]] and [[anglesite]], and is closely associated with [[lanarkite]] and [[susannite]]. Scotlandite represents the latest phase in the crystallization sequence of the associated lead secondary minerals.  It can often be found in the vuggy [[anglesite]] as yellowish single crystals up to 1 millimeter in length that sometimes arrange in a fan-shaped aggregates.  [[Anglesite]] can usually be recognized in a very thin coating on scotlandite which is used to protect the [[sulfite]] from further oxidation.  A second variety of scotlandite can also occur in discontinuously distributed cavities between the [[anglesite]] mass containing the first variety and the [[barite]] matrix. This variety is characterized by tiny, whitish to water-clear crystals, and crystal clusters less than one millimeter in size, which encrust large portions of the interior of the cavities. Scotlandite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scotlandite is a pale yellow, greyish-white, colorless, transparent mineral with an adamantine or pearly luster. It exhibits a hardness of 2 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]].&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scotlandite occurs as chisel-shaped or bladed crystals elongated along the c-axis, with a tendency to form radiating clusters. Its crystals are characterized by the {100}, {010}, {011}, {021}, {031}, and {032}.  [[Miller Index|faces]]. Scotlandite shows perfect cleavage along the {100} plane and a less good one along the {010} plane. The measured density is 6.37 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scotlandite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. The mineral is optically [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], 2V&lt;sub&gt;meas.&lt;/sub&gt; 35° 24'(Na). The refractive indices are: α ~ 2.035, β ~ 2.040, and γ ~ 2.085 (Na). Dispersion is strong, v &gt;&gt; r. The extinction is β//b, and α [001] = 20° (γ [100] = 4° in the obtuse angle β. H(Mohs) &lt; 2. D = 6.37 and calculated D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.40 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;  The [[infrared spectrum]] of scotlandite shows conclusively that it is an anhydrous [[sulfite]], with no OH groups or other polyatomic anions being present. It is also proven by [[electron microprobe]] analysis and [[infrared spectroscopy]] that scotlandite must be a polymorph of lead sulfite.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scotlandite is a [[sulfite]] compared with chemically related compounds, it is very close to the value of [[anglesite]] (6.38 g cm&lt;sub&gt;−3&lt;/sub&gt;), but distinctly different from that of [[lanarkite]] (6.92 g cm&lt;sub&gt;−3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Orthorhombic]] lead sulfite is of higher density (D&lt;sub&gt;meas&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.54, calculated D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.56 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), and has the same chemical properties as well.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt; The empirical chemical formula for scotlandite calculated on the basis of Pb+S = 2, is Pb&lt;sub&gt;l.06&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.94&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2.94&lt;/sub&gt; or more ideally PbSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
A small crystal of scotlandite, showing some cleavage faces, was examined using Weissenberg and precession techniques. Scotlandite is in the [[monoclinic]] crystal system. The only systematic extinctions observed from the single crystal patterns were 0k0 where k was odd. Thus the possible [[space group]] is either P2 or P2/m. The unit cell parameters obtained from the single crystal study were used to index the X-ray powder pattern and were then refined with the indexed powder data.&lt;ref name=Paar /&gt; The results are: a = 4.505&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]], b = 5.333&amp;nbsp;Å, c = 6.405&amp;nbsp;Å; β= 106.24°; Z&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. If the present a and c axes are interchanged, the unit cell of scotlandite is very similar, isotypic, to that of [[molybdomenite]], PbSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Lead is coordinated to nine oxygen atoms with Pb-O&lt;sub&gt;av&lt;/sub&gt;=2.75 Å, and possibly further to one sulfur atom with Pb−S=3.46 Å.  The average S−O distance in the pyramidal SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group is 1.52 Å.&lt;ref name=springer /&gt;

Innovations conventionally associated with terrestrially first appeared in aquatic [[elpistostegalians]] such as ''[[Panderichthys]] rhombolepis'', ''[[Elpistostege]] watsoni'', and ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]''. Phylogenetic analyses distribute the features that developed along the tetrapod stem and display a stepwise process of character acquisition, rather than abrupt.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J.

By the [[Upper Devonian]] period, the fin-limb transition as well as other skeletal changes such as gill arch reduction, opercular series loss, mid-line fin loss, and scale reduction were already completed in many aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;Coates, M.I., Jeffery, J.E., &amp; Ruta, M.

Some adaptations required to adjust to non-aquatic life include the movement and use of alternating limbs, the use of pelvic appendages as sturdy propulsors, and the use of a solid surface at the organism’s base to generate propulsive force required for walking.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, H.M., Shubin, N.H., Coates, M.I., &amp; Hale, M.E.

Palatal and nasal skeletal features like choanae are present in these groups and are also observed in modern amphibians. This indicates that incipient air breathing was developed, as well as modification of the hyoid arch towards stapes development.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002).

The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*.

The primary change from basic ostelepiform ancestors to the first elpistostegalid in the middle Devonian was to the pre-existing roof skulls.&lt;ref&gt;LONG, J. A. (1990).

=== Head changes in prototetrapod ===

[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Elginerpeton'']]

In ''[[Elginerpeton pancheni]]'', a prototetrapod from the late [[Frasnian]], basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed to fill the gap between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The ''Elginerpeton'' is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tubular lower jaw of the ''Elginerpeton'', compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting – allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for buccopharyngeal breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004).

=== Head changes in aquatic tetrapods ===
[[File:Acanthostega BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Acanthostega'']] 
In the tetrapod and higher clades from the lower-middle [[Famennian]] there are several defining changes on the basis of anatomy of ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', ''[[Tulerpeton]]'', and ''[[Acanthostega]]''. In the cranium, there is a stapes derived from the hyomandibular of fishes; a single bilateral pair of nasal bones, and a fenestra ovalis in the otic capsule of the braincase.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, O. A., &amp; Coates, M. I. (1995). The postcranial skeleton of the Devonian tetrapod Tulerpeton curtum Lebedev. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 114(3), 307-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the otic wall of the braincase can be considered a paedomorphic feature for tetrapods and is linked to the stapes functionally.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; The stapes was thought to be just a structural support between the palate and the stapedial plate of the braincase.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Acanthostega'', it is likely that due to the otic capsule of the brain case being mesial to the stapedial plate, sound was picked up from the palate or the otic notch to allow for rudimentary hearing. It was able to perceive vibrations by opening its mouth by way of the palate. Other factors that caused aquatic tetrapods to spend more time on land caused the development of terrestrial hearing with the development of a tympanum within an otic notch and developed by convergent evolution at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;Laurin, M. (1998, March). The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I. Systematics, middle ear evolution and jaw suspension. In Annales des Sciences Naturelles-Zoologie et Biologie Animale (Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 1-42). Elsevier Masson.&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also a change in the dermal bones of the skull in the aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; It involved the enlargement of the jugal, ceasing the contact of the maxilla with the squamosal and the single bilateral pair of nasal bones. The feature allows for a stronger bite as well as increasing the strength of the skull.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teeth and feeding mechanisms ===

Feeding on land is a completely different task than feeding in water. Water is much more dense and viscous compared to air, causing hunting techniques adapted in water to be less successful when applied on land.&lt;ref name=Lauder&gt;Lauder, G. V. (1985). Aquatic feeding in lower vertebrates. Functional vertebrate morphology, 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The main technique used in water is suction feeding and is used by most aquatic vertebrates. This technique does not function in air so animals use methods of overtaking prey with jaws followed by biting down.&lt;ref&gt;Bramble, D. M., Liem, K. F., &amp; Wake, D. B. (1985). Functional vertebrate morphology (pp. 38-57). Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitional forms prior to fully developed terrestrial tetrapods such as ''Acanthostega'', are thought to have captured prey in the water.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Large coronoid fangs are present in the fishes ''Eusthenopteron'', ''Panderichthys'', and ''Tiktaalik'', and the early tetrapod, ''Ventasega''. In ''Acanthostega'', which is more derived, the large teeth are absent. In ''Eusthenopetron'' and ''Panderichthys'', an ossified operculum is exhibited unlike in the ''Tiktaalik'', ''Ventastega'', and ''Acanthostega''. These differences as well as reductions of the gill chamber and changes in the nature of the lower jaw are hypothesized to indicate a reduced reliance on suction feeding in early tetrapods in comparison to osteolepiform fish.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological data is not enough however to prove that suction feeding was less used as the morphological changes have been found in fish that use the suction feeding mechanism.&lt;ref name=Clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). The dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(01), 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranial sutures are indicators of skull function and morphologies can be linked to specific feeding modes.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S. W., &amp; Mucci, R. J. (1991). In vivo strain in cranial sutures: the zygomatic arch. Journal of morphology, 207(3), 225-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows for the creation of a sutural morphospace.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish Polypterus: implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish ''[[Polypterus]]'': implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in ''Polypterus'', a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod ''[[Phonerpeton]]'', there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. ''Acanthostega'' fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neck ==
The cranial endoskeleton of ''T. roseae'' shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in ''T. roseae'' compared to other tetrapodomorph fish.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Acanthostega'' and ''Ichthyostega'', which are considered to be more derived than other basal aquatic tetrapods, the pectoral girdle is decoupled from the skull. There is also a loss of the dorsal pectoral girdle bones, which permits a large degree of movement for the shoulder. This allowed for a greater degree of movement, and is a necessity for improving aquatic maneuveurs and terrestrial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Z., Ahlberg, P., &amp; Ritchie, A. (2003). The braincase and palate of the tetrapodomorph sarcopterygian Mandageria fairfaxi: morphological variability near the fish–tetrapod transition. Palaeontology, 46(2), 271-293.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been driven by the need to lift the head to aid aerial respiration by using nostrils and choanae.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limbs ==

Limbs in vertebrates are occasionally organized into stylopod (relating to the humerus and femur), zeugopod (relating to the radius and tibia, along with associated structures) and autopod (relating to digits) categories, although anatomically, the evolutionary differences between these groups in early tetrapods tends to be vague.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, S.F. (2000). Development of the tetrapod limb. Developmental Biology 6. Retrieved from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9975/&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The transition from fins to limbs occurred once an endoskeleton entered the base of the fin, as seen in today's lungfish.&lt;ref name=hinch&gt;Hinchliffe, R.J. (1994). Evolutionary developmental biology of the tetrapod limb. Developmental 1994 Supplement, 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to have originated in the group [[Sarcopterygians]], including osteolipiforms like ''Eusthenopteron'', due to the homology of the tetrapod forelimb and the osteolepiform fin endoskeleton.&lt;ref name=hinch /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' is a partially aquatic tetrapod with developed limbs that shares features common with the earlier tetrapods, ''Panderichthys'' and ''Eusthenopteron''.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Like ''Panderichthys'',  the humerus of ''Acanthostega'' is flattened dorso-ventrally, the intermedium terminates level with the radius, and the endoskeleton can be divided into stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium segments.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Similar to ''Eusthenopteron'', the radials do not articulate with the radius on the distal end.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;  ''Acanthostega'' also has a 1:2 ratio of humerus to radius and ulna, a feature seen in all tetrapods higher than ''Acanthostega'' on the phylogeny.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Unlike ''Panderichthys'', ''Acanthostega'' hind limbs are at least the size of its fore limbs, if not larger.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This development of larger limbs is required to physically support the organism during emergence from an aquatic setting to land. The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' also contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods, hinting at the presence of digits.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Similarly, ''Ossinodus'' has two hindlimbs located bilaterally and proximodistally aymmetrical.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the presence of a small femur during juvenile development, this Carboniferous- period tetrapod is thought to be aquatic during juvenile development; only emerging onto land once it reaches adulthood.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ossinodus'' also has a broad, flat tibia, akin to ''Acanthostega'', and is thought to be only partially terrestrial.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pelvis ==
The development of the pelvic region was crucial for the adaptation from water to land, yet some features of tetrapod locomotion are thought to have arose before the origin of digited limbs or the transition from water to land.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; The fossil record of early tetrapods shows evidence of distinct pelvic development occurring in osteolepiforms, further supporting osteolepiform ancestry of terrestrial tetrapods.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' has a large pelvis, with the iliac region articulating with the axial skeleton and a broad ischial plate.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; It has a sacrum; a fundamental skeletal feature that allows the organism to transfer force produced in its hindlimbs to its axial skeleton, and move in a terrestrial environment.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; A pubo-ischiadic symphysis is also observed, uniting the two pelvic halves.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Protopterus]] annectens'' (a member of lungfish, thought to be a sister group to tetrapods) has a small, anatomically simpler pelvis, a derived limb endoskeleton and a lack of digits.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Yet, it shares the ability to lift itself using a solid surface as a base with its pelvic region with ''Acanthostega'' and is also observed to move with tetrapod-like locomotion in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This illustrates that a fundamental innovation in tetrapods is also found in a lower, sister taxon, in which members lack a sacrum.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

== Digits and Limb Joints ==

''Acanthostega'' is the earliest example of a digitized tetrapod.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; ''Acanthostega'' has a total lack of dermal fin rays and displays the presence of two or more spool-shaped bones or cartilages articulating individually in antero-posterial sets on the distal end of its limbs.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This feature can now be distinguished as digits instead of the endoskeletal radials seen in earlier tetrapods.

''[[Pederpes]]'', a tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous period, also has hindlimbs containing 5 digits that are rotated to face anteriorly.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous tetrapods, who have been only partially adapted to land, ''Pederpes'' has the novel ability to bend its limbs and propel itself forwards in a terrestrial setting. This is attributed to the symmetry of the digits and limbs in ''Pederpes'', allowing it to rotate its hindlimbs to an anteriorly facing position and propel itself from the edge of the foot when moving forward.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological development of bendable wrists and ankles can distinguish ''Pederpes'' the first true terrestrial tetrapod.

'''''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches''''' is a book on human [[kinship]] and social behavior by Maximilian Holland, published in 2012. The work synthesizes the perspectives of [[evolutionary biology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]] towards understanding human social bonding and cooperative behavior. It presents a theoretical treatment that many consider to have resolved longstanding questions about the proper place of genetic (or 'blood') connections in human kinship and social relations, and a synthesis that ''"should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology"''.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;Philip Kitcher comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been called ''"A landmark in the field of evolutionary biology"''&lt;ref name=AV2014&gt;{{cite web | first = Augusto | last = Vitale | title = Review of ''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship'' | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 85 | year = 2014 | pages = 215 | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/365178}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ''"gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior"'',&lt;ref name=RF2012&gt;Robin Fox comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; ''"places genetic determinism in the correct perspective"''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt; and serves as ''"a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries."''&lt;ref name=SS2015&gt;{{cite web | first = Stuart | last = Semple| title = Review of: Holland, M (2012) Social bonding and nurture kinship: compatibility between cultural and biological approaches. | journal = Acta Ethologica | volume = | year = | pages = | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10211-015-0225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the book is to show that ''"properly interpreted,  cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data)  and biological approaches are perfectly compatible regarding processes of social bonding in humans."''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Pages 283-284&lt;/ref&gt; Holland's position is based on demonstrating that the dominant biological theory of social behavior ([[inclusive fitness]] theory) is typically misunderstood to predict that genetic ties are necessary for the ''expression'' of social behaviors, whereas in fact the theory only implicates genetic associations as necessary for the ''evolution'' of social behaviors. Whilst rigorous evolutionary biologists have long understood the distinction between these levels of analysis (see [[Tinbergen's four questions]]), past attempts to apply inclusive fitness theory to humans have often overlooked the distinction between ''evolution'' and ''expression''.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its central argument, the broader philosophical implications of Holland's work are considered by commentators to be that it both ''"helps to untangle a long-standing disciplinary muddle"''&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt; and ''"clarifies the relationship between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship."''&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hrdy comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that the book ''"demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs"''&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book description), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consequence, delivers ''"a convincing, solid and informed blow to the residual genetic determinism that still influences the interpretation of social behaviour."''&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

The book's form consists of a cumulative argument (using a wide range of supporting evidence) made over nine chapters, with each chapter ending in a brief retrospective summary, and the final chapter containing a recapitulation and summary of the whole,&lt;ref&gt;This synopsis is based mainly on the book's chapter summaries and concluding chapter&lt;/ref&gt; and drawing some wider conclusions.

===Continuing debate over 'blood kinship'===
{{See also|Kinship}}

Holland begins by tracing transitions in the history of anthropological theories of social behavior and [[kinship]], noting the varying importance with which 'blood ties' have been understood to be a necessary element of human kinship and social relations. He suggests that whilst the mounting [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence has led to a move away from the 'blood kinship' concept in recent decades, many sociocultural anthropologists still query the connection between kinship and blood, reproduction or some other apparently biological functions. Meanwhile, many biologists, [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have persisted in viewing human kinship and cooperative behavior as necessarily associated with genetic relationships and 'blood ties'. The current situation has been characterized as "''a clash between incommensurate paradigms, holding as they may, completely incompatible ideas about human nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;Philip Thomas comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt; Holland argues that a clear resolution to these questions is still outstanding, and would therefore be of value. In closing the introduction, Holland writes; "The approach  is not reductive. The claim is rather that a thorough investigation of the ‘biological facts’ can be useful mainly though allowing a change in focus... away from confusion about the place of genealogy in social ties, and onto a reformulated baseline, built around varied ''processual aspects of social bonding.''"&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary biology theory of social behavior===
{{See also|Inclusive fitness}}

The book reviews the background and key elements of [[W.D.Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[inclusive fitness]] theory from the 1960s onwards, setting out its significant conceptual and heuristic value. Holland notes that Hamilton acknowledged that his earliest and most widely known account (1964)&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1964. The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7:1-52. 1964&lt;/ref&gt; contained technical inaccuracies. He also notes Hamilton's early speculations about possible proximate mechanisms of the expression of social behavior (''supergenes''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt; as a possible alternative to ''behaviour-evoking-situations''&lt;ref name="Hamilton, William D 1964"/&gt;) contained errors that have nevertheless remained very influential in popular accounts. Specifically, the supergenes notion (sometimes called the ''[[Green-beard effect]]'') - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the intervening years, the notion that supergenes (or more often, simply individual organisms) have evolved ''to identify genetic relatives and preferentially cooperate with them'' took hold, and became the way many biologists came to understand the theory. This persisted, despite Hamilton's 1987 correction. In Holland's view it is the pervasiveness of this longstanding but erroneous perspective, and the suppression of the alternative 'behaviour-evoking-situations' perspective regarding social expression mechanisms, that is largely responsible for the ongoing clash between biological and sociocultural approaches to human kinship.

===Sociobiology and kinship===

Holland shows that, in the 1970s and 80s, the first wave of attempts (known as ''human [[sociobiology]]'' or ''[[Darwinian anthropology]]'') to apply inclusive fitness theory to human social behavior relied on, and further reinforced, this same misinterpretation (above section) about the theory's predictions and the proximate mechanisms of social behavior. Holland also shows that this period of research was burdened with many misplaced assumptions about ''universal'' attributes of the human sexes, [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] roles, apparently projected from the ''specific cultural values'' of the researchers themselves. Holland also shows that, following the perceived failures of this early wave, and particularly its methodological agnosticism regarding proximate mechanisms of social behavior, the [[evolutionary psychology]] school grew up in its place. Although this latter school typically avoided engaging with the ethnographic data on human kinship, Holland argues that in the few cases where it did so, it repeated the misinterpretation of inclusive fitness theory that characterized the first wave. Holland also notes that [[Philip Kitcher|Kitcher]], in his&lt;ref&gt;Kitcher, Philip. 1985. Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; critique of the sociobiological position, suggested that perhaps the expression of social behaviors in humans might quite simply be based on cues of context and familiarity, rather than genetic relatedness ''per se''.

===Proximate mechanisms and 'kin recognition'===
{{See also| Kin recognition}}

Chapters four and five investigate further the theory and evidence surrounding the ''proximate mechanisms'' of social behavior; specifically the question of whether social behaviors are expressed by organisms via ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' or via direct detection of actual genetic relatedness. Related questions have been the domain of [[kin recognition]] theory. Holland notes that the name 'kin recognition' itself suggests some expectation that a positive identification of genetic relatedness is a prediction of inclusive fitness theory, and is thus expected. Similar points have been made by others; "many behavioural ecologists seem to implicitly assume that specialised mechanisms allowing individuals to distinguish their kin from non-kin must have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Z. 2001. The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation. Behavioural Processes 53:21-40. Page 21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. 1990. Do animals really recognize kin? Animal Behaviour 39:42-54.&lt;/ref&gt;" Again, the possibility that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' might be the more parsimonious&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, William D. 1987. Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked. In Kin recognition in animals, edited by D. J. C. Fletcher and C. D. Michener. New York: Wiley. On page 420, Hamilton clearly states that ''"Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.''"&lt;/ref&gt; mechanism of the expression of social behavior, and fully compatible with inclusive fitness theory, has often been underemphasized. However, Holland's review of the evidence notes that field studies in this area quickly established that ''behaviour-evoking-situations'' do in fact overwhelmingly mediate social behaviours in those species studied, and that, particularly in mammal species, social bonding and familiarity formed in early developmental contexts (e.g. in burrows or nesting sites) are a common mediating mechanism for social behaviors, independently of genetic relatedness ''per se''. On the basis of the preceding theoretical analysis and review of evidence, at the end of chapter five, Holland argues that;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely erroneous, both in reference to theory and in reference to the evidence, to claim or suggest that 'the facts of biology' support the claim that organisms have evolved to cooperate with genetic relatives ''per se''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Primate social bonding and attachment theory===
{{See also| Attachment theory}}

Having argued for the above position on the lack of necessity for genetic relatedness ''per se'' to mediate social bonding and behavior, Holland suggests that "The further question then is; can we uncover in any greater detail how familiarity and other context-dependent cues operate?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;. To discover the extent to which the variety of human kinship behaviors may nevertheless be compatible with this (less deterministic) interpretation of biological theory of social behavior, Holland suggests that a survey of [[primate|primates']] most fundamental social patterns may give clues, especially those of species most closely connected with humans. The variety of primate [[mating system]]s, group-membership ('[[philopatry]]') patterns, and life-cycle patterns are reviewed. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like other mammals, Catarrhini primate demographics are strongly influenced by ecological conditions, particularly density and distribution of food sources... Cohesive social groups and delayed natal dispersal mean that maternally related individuals, including maternal siblings, face a statistically reliable context of interaction in all Catarrhini primates. This reliable context of interaction with maternally related individuals is extended amongst those species with female philopatry (especially Cercopithecinae).&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with other social mammals, evidence suggest that the reliability of 'behaviour-evoking-situations' this social context provides has shaped the mechanisms of proximate expression of social bonding and behavior;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of infants by females (and sometimes males) demonstrates that care-giving and bonding to infants is not mediated by positive powers of discrimination. From the infant's perspective, it will bond with any responsive carer. If not necessarily the actual mother, in natural conditions this will often be a maternal relative (particularly an older sibling), but the context is primary, not the actual relatedness. Similarly, social bonding and social behaviours between maternal siblings (and occasionally between other maternal relatives) is context-driven in primates, and mediated via the care-giver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holland also notes how [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] and colleagues' [[attachment theory]] was strongly informed by primate bonding patterns and mechanisms, and that in Bowlby's later writing the then emerging [[inclusive fitness]] theory was explicitly linked to. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Bowlby's] work demonstrated that social attachments form on the basis of provision of care, and responsiveness to elicitations for care. The social context of living together and the familiarity this brings, provides the circumstance within which social bonds can form...&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the basis of combining more recent primate research with the findings of attachment theory, Holland proposes that "In attempting to define more specific forms of ''the giving of care and nurture'' which may mediate social bonding we [find] that provision of food is likely to play a part, as well as the more intangible provision of warmth and comfort, and a safe base for sleeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;"

===Processual and nurture kinship in humans===
{{See also|Nurture kinship}}

Holland claims that, while biological theory of social behavior is not [[determinism|deterministic]] in respect of genetic relatedness vis-a-vis the formation of social bonds and expression of social behaviors, evidence does point to compatibility between a [[reductionism|non-reductive]] interpretation of the theory and how such bonds and behaviors operate in social mammals, primates and in humans. In the final part of the book, Holland explores the extent to which this perspective is also compatible with sociocultural anthropology's ethnographic accounts of human kinship and social behavior, both occasional accounts from the past, as well as more contemporary accounts that have explicitly eschewed the earlier 'blood ties' assumption. Holland finds that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many contemporary accounts focus on social bonds formed in childhood and the importance of the performance of acts of care, including food provision, in mediating these bonds. In all cases it is this performance of care which is considered the overriding factor in
mediating social bonds, notwithstanding 'blood ties'. In short, there is strong compatibility between the perspectives on social bonding that emerge from a proper account of biological theory and those documented by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Conclusion===

Holland's concluding chapter gives a summary of his fundamental position;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A crucial implication of this argument taken as a whole is that ''the expression of the kinds of social behaviours treated by inclusive fitness theory does not require genetic relatedness.'' Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology's claims that biological science predicts that organisms ''will'' direct social behaviour towards relatives are thus both ''theoretically'' and ''empirically'' erroneous. Such claims and their supporting arguments also give a highly misleading and reductive account of basic biological theory. Properly interpreted, ''cultural anthropology approaches (and ethnographic data) and biological approaches are perfectly compatible'' regarding processes of social bonding in humans. Most of all, this requires a focus on the circumstances and processes which lead to social bonding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book notes that, as an outcome of the analysis, [[David M. Schneider|Schneider's]] sociocultural perspective on human kinship is vindicated;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do the biological facts have some priority or are they but one of the conditions, like ecology, economy, demography, etc., to which kinship systems must adapt? Take note: if the latter is the case, then kinship must be as much rooted in these other conditions as in the biological facts.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, David M. 1984. A critique of the study of kinship. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author supplies several examples of the insight that Schneider's broad approach can provide. The book closes with an example of a clash of cultural perspectives on kinship and family norms, and makes the suggestion that;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Constructing from narrow cultural particulars (Euro-American or otherwise) an essentialised model of 'human nature' does not constitute science; it is closer to cultural colonialism. In any analysis intended to shed light on proposed universals of the human condition, reflexivity is essential, and cultural and biological approaches both surely necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Holland 2012, Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, North Charleston. Page 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception and reviews==

===General===
Kinship theorist and member of the [[national academy of science]], [[Robin Fox]] wrote of the work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An excellent and constructive discussion of matters in kinship and its cultural and biological components, handsomely reconciling what have been held to be incompatible positions.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Fox commentary, Fox's Website, http://robin-fox.com/books.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Holland gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior. If he had been in the debate in the 1980s then a lot of subsequent confusion could have been avoided"&lt;ref name="RF2012"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irwin Bernstein, distinguished research professor in the university of Georgia's ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences Program'' made the following comment on Holland's book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has demonstrated extraordinarily thorough scholarship in his exhaustive review of the often contentious discussions of kinship.  He has produced a balanced synthesis melding the two approaches exemplified in the biological and sociocultural behavioral positions. His work in reconciling opposing views clearly demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary approaches.  This should be the definitive word on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin Bernstein comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Kitcher]], John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, and James R. Barker Professorship of Contemporary Civilization at [[Columbia University]], past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]] and inaugural winner of the Prometheus Prize, stated of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Max Holland has provided a wide-ranging and deeply-probing analysis of the influence of genetic relatedness and social context on human kinship. He argues that while genetic relatedness may play a role in the evolution of social behavior, it does not determine the forms of such behavior. His discussion is exemplary for its thoroughness, and should inspire more nuanced ventures in applying Darwinian approaches to sociocultural anthropology.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sociocultural anthropology===
Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of [[anthropology]] at the university of Dartmouth, wrote that Holland's book was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A brilliant discussion of the relationship between kinship and social bonding as understood in evolutionary biology and in sociocultural anthropology. Among other contributions, it debunks the common misconception that biological evolution involves individual organisms actively pursuing the goal of increasing the numbers of their genes in successive generations, the measure of their so-called ‘individual inclusive fitness’. Holland demonstrates that an alternative non-deterministic interpretation of evolutionary biology is more compatible with actual human social behavior and with the frameworks that sociocultural anthropology employs.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Endicott comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Social-Bonding-Nurture-Kinship-Compatibility/dp/1480182001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Janet Carsten, kinship theorist and professor of anthropology at the university of Edinburgh stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This book is a scholarly attempt to get beyond the often sterile oppositions between evolutionary and culturalist approaches to kinship. In bringing together two sides of the debate, it constitutes a valuable contribution to kinship studies.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Carsten comment, Author's website, |url=https://maximilianholland.com/2013/04/25/social-bonding-and-nurture-kinship-synopsis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for the journal [[Critique of Anthropology]], Nicholas Malone concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lucid and effective... Holland has produced a significant work of scholarship that will be of interest to a wide swath of the anthropological community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Malone Review, Critique of Anthropology, DOI: 10.1177/0308275X15594535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the book for the journal [[Social Analysis]], Anni Kajanus found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Holland has done an excellent and thorough job in reviewing the disciplinary and interdisciplinary histories of approaches to kinship and social bonds in anthropology, biology, and psychology. Most importantly, he clarifies the different levels of analysis when looking at human behavior in real time and in the evolutionary time frame. This makes the book essential reading for anyone who acknowledges that human relatedness and social bonds are shaped by the
evolved dispositions of our species, their development through the life-course of an individual, and our specific cultural-historical environments... Holland’s book goes a long way toward clarifying and therefore advancing these theoretical debates&lt;ref&gt;Anni Kajanus Review, Social Analysis, web: http://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/social-analysis/60/3/sa600308.xml, DOI: 10.3167/sa.2016.600308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Biology===
An in-depth review of the book by [[primatology|primatologist]] Augusto Vitale, in the journal ''[[Folia Primatologica]]'', found that:
                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;blockquote&gt;This is, without a doubt, a very significant and important contribution to the on-going discussion about the determinants of sociality in humans as well as in other animals... A painstaking analysis of inclusive fitness, attachment theory and non-human primate social relationships, through a fascinating journey which ends with an anthropological account of social bonds in different cultures... It is a landmark in the field of evolutionary biology, which places genetic determinism in the correct perspective.&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart Semple, evolutionary anthropologist, reviewing the book in the journal ''[[Acta Ethologica]]'' stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As someone who teaches behavioural ecology to biologists, and primate biology to social and biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, as well as to my colleagues. Not only does it help to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.&lt;ref name=SS2015 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Published debate and criticism of the book==
{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=September 2014}}

In addition to praise for the book's significance, the [[Folia Primatologica]] review noted that the book is at times too dense and requires close reading;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument here and there becomes too detailed and tortuous, but it is absolutely captivating... [Colleagues] who are less used to extremely detailed theoretical reasoning, will find it difficult at the beginning...&lt;ref name=AV2014 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Soil''' is a [[mixture]] of [[organic matter]], [[minerals]], [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[organism]]s that together support [[life]]. [[Earth]]'s body of soil is the [[pedosphere]], which has four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of [[water storage]], supply and purification; it is a modifier of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]; it is a habitat for organisms; all of which, in turn, modify the soil.

The pedosphere interfaces with the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesworth |first=Ward |date=2008 |title=Encyclopedia of soil science |isbn=978-1402039942 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands |nopp=true |url=http://data.lib.hutech.edu.vn/mucluc/f2e0a00788a82be82718e64d734d1a50.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pedolith'', used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ''ground stone''. Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a [[Porosity|porous]] phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voroney |first1=R.

==Overview==
[[File:Soil profile.png|thumb|Soil Profile: Darkened topsoil and reddish subsoil [[soil horizons|layers]] are typical in [[humid subtropical climate|some regions.]]]]

===Functions===
Soil is a major component of the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]]. The world's ecosystems are impacted in far-reaching ways by the processes carried out in the soil, from [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] to [[rainforest destruction]] and [[water pollution]].

Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a [[soil horizon|soil profile]] which consists of two or more layers, referred to as [[soil horizon]]s, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity.&lt;ref name="Buol"/&gt; The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of [[parent material]], the processes that modify those parent materials, and the [[Soil#soil-forming factors|soil-forming factors]] that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The [[solum]] normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.{{sfn|Simonson|1957|p=17}}

The [[soil texture]] is determined by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] processes causes those particles to [[flocculate]] (stick together) to form [[soil structure|aggregates]] or [[ped]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronick |first1=Carol J. |last2=Lal |first2=Ratan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil structure and management: a review |journal=Geoderma |date=January 2005 |volume=124 |issue=1/2 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.03.005 |url=http://tinread.usarb.md:8888/tinread/fulltext/lal/soil_structure.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Geode.124....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, [[porosity]], [[consistency]], reaction ([[acidity]]), etc.

Water is a critical agent in soil development due to its involvement in the dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |website=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of water and dissolved or suspended materials that occupy the soil [[pore space]] is called the soil solution. Since [[soil water]] is never pure water, but contains hundreds of dissolved organic and mineral substances, it may be more accurately called the soil solution. Water is central to the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of minerals from the [[soil profile]]. Finally, water affects the type of vegetation that grows in a soil, which in turn affects the development of the soil, a complex feedback which is exemplified in the dynamics of banded vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentin |first1=Christian |last2=d'Herbès |first2=Jean-Marc |last3=Poesen |first3=Jean |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=37 |issue=1 |title=Soil and water components of banded vegetation patterns |year=1999 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248379223 |pages=1‒24 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00053-3 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These bound nutrients interact with soil water to buffer the soil solution composition (attenuate changes in the soil solution) as soils wet up or dry out, as plants take up nutrients, as salts are leached, or as acids or alkalis are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/SSAC121/lec14.pdf |title=Soil colloids: properties, nature, types and significance |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soilminerals.com/Cation_Exchange_Simplified.htm |title=Cation exchange capacity in soils, simplified |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrient availability is affected by [[soil pH]], which is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil solution. Soil pH is a function of many soil forming factors, and is generally lower (more acid) where weathering is more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18519/FS-1054%20Soil%20pH%20and%20Nutrient%20Availbility.pdf |last=Miller |first=Jarrod O. |title=Soil pH affects nutrient availability |website=[[University of Maryland]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most plant nutrients, with the exception of nitrogen, originate from the [[mineral]]s that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulding |first1=Keith W.T. |last2=Bailey |first2=Neal J. |last3=Bradbury |first3=Nicola J. |last4=Hargreaves |first4=Patrick |last5=Howe |first5=MT |last6=Murphy |first6=Daniel V. |last7=Poulton |first7=Paul R. |last8=Willison |first8=Toby W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=139 |issue=1 |title=Nitrogen deposition and its contribution to nitrogen cycling and associated soil processes |year=1998 |pages=49‒58 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00182.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues ([[soil organic matter]]), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living [[Soil microbe|microorganisms]] and [[soil organic matter]] are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kononova |first=M.

==History of studies==

===Fertility===
The history of the study of soil is intimately tied to humans' urgent need to provide food for themselves and forage for our animals. Throughout history, civilizations have prospered or declined as a function of the availability and productivity of their soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillel |first=Daniel |date=1993 |title=Out of the Earth: civilization and the life of the soil |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0520080805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek historian [[Xenophon]] (450–355 BCE) is credited with being the first to expound upon the merits of green-manuring crops: "But then whatever weeds are upon the ground, being turned into earth, enrich the soil as much as dung."{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}

[[Columella]]'s "Husbandry," circa 60 CE, advocated the use of lime and that [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]] ([[green manure]]) should be turned under, and was used by 15 generations (450 years) under the [[Roman Empire]] until its collapse.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=1}} From the [[fall of Rome]] to the [[French Revolution]], knowledge of soil and agriculture was passed on from parent to child and as a result, crop yields were low.

Experiments into what made plants grow first led to the idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was the essential element but overlooked the role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Ploeg |first1=Rienk R. |last2=Schweigert |first2=Peter |last3=Bachmann |first3=Joerg |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Scientific World Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=S2 |title=Use and misuse of nitrogen in agriculture: the German story |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2001/683180/abs/ |year=2001 |pages=737–44 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2001.263 |pmid=12805882 |pmc=6084271 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1635, the Flemish chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] thought he had proved water to be the essential element from his famous five years' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came from the fact that the increase in the plant's weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil's weight.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=3}} [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was the essential element. Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Nyle C. |title=The nature and properties of soils |edition=9th |year=1984 |publisher=[[Collier Macmillan]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0023133404}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=2}}

As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of [[soil fertility]]. The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [combust] oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]]'s willow tree derived from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=de Lavoisier |first=Antoine-Laurent |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title=Mémoire sur la combustion en général |year=1777 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Franklin/Franklin_pdf/Mem1777_p592.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the French agriculturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=Boussingault |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=Agronomie, chimie agricole et physiologie, volumes 1-5 |year=1860–1874 |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris, France |url=https://archive.org/details/8TSUP364_1 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig]] in his book ''Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology'' (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Liebig |first=Justus |title=Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology |year=1840 |publisher=Taylor and Walton |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00liebrich |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the composition and money value of the different varieties of guano |year=1849 |volume=10 |pages=196–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/37078#page/220/mode/1up |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] worked in the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]], founded by the former, and (re)discovered that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the "[[superphosphate]]", consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}} This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was recovered and used as fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tandon |first=Hari L.S. |url=http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |title=A short history of fertilisers |website=Fertiliser Development and Consultation Organisation |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms still awaited discovery.

In 1856 J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J.

It was known that certain [[legume]]s could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist [[Hermann Hellriegel]] and the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}}

[[Crop rotation]], mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|pp=1–4}}

===Formation===
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials, under the action of [[Life|biotic]] and abiotic (not associated with life) processes. After studies of the improvement of the soil commenced, others began to study soil genesis and as a result also soil types and classifications.

In 1860, in Mississippi, [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] studied the relationship among rock material, climate, and vegetation, and the type of soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered soil types classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilgard |first=Eugene W. |title=Soils: their formation, properties, composition, and relations to climate and plant growth in the humid and arid regions |year=1921 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]] |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/65783 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately his work was not continued. At the same time [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] (about 1870) was leading a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, finding that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for soil classifications. Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by [[Konstantin Glinka|Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka]], a member of the Russian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ge |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=Die Typen der Bodenbildung: ihre Klassifikation und geographische Verbreitung |year=1914 |publisher=[[Borntraeger]] |location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curtis F. Marbut]] was influenced by the work of the Russian team, translated Glinka's publication into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=The great soil groups of the world and their development |year=1927 |publisher=Edwards Brothers |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as he was placed in charge of the U. S. [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], applied it to a national soil classification system.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;

==Formation==
Soil formation, or [[pedogenesis]], is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and [[colloid]]s are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive [[soil horizons]]. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those [[regolith]]s that formed on Mars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bishop |first1=Janice L. |last2=Murchie |first2=Scott L. |last3=Pieters |first3=Carlé L. |last4=Zent |first4=Aaron P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002 |title=A model for formation of dust, soil, and rock coatings on Mars: physical and chemical processes on the Martian surface |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=107 |issue=E11 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1029/2001JE001581 |bibcode=2002JGRE..107.5097B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro-González |first1=Rafael |last2=Rainey |first2=Fred A. |last3=Molina |first3=Paola |last4=Bagaley |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Hollen |first5=Becky J. |last6=de la Rosa |first6=José |last7=Small |first7=Alanna M. |last8=Quinn |first8=Richard C. |last9=Grunthaner |first9=Frank J. |last10=Cáceres |first10=Luis |last11=Gomez-Silva |first11=Benito |last12=McKay |first12=Christopher P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2003 |title=Mars-like soils in the Atacama desert, Chile, and the dry limit of microbial life |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=302 |issue=5647 |pages=1018–21 |doi=10.1126/science.1089143 |pmid=14605363 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9020258 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1018N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[lichens]] and [[cyanobacteria]] then [[epilithic]] [[higher plants]]) become established very quickly on [[basalt]]ic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with [[nutrient]]-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks. Crevasses and pockets, local topography of the rocks, would hold fine materials and harbour plant roots. The developing plant roots are associated with mineral-[[weathering]] [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]]&lt;ref name="Van Schöll2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Schöll |first1=Laura |last2=Smits |first2=Mark M. |last3=Hoffland |first3=Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=Ectomycorrhizal weathering of the soil minerals muscovite and hornblende |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=805–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01790.x |pmid=16918551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that assist in breaking up the porous lava, and by these means organic matter and a finer mineral soil accumulate with time.

===Factors===

How soil formation proceeds is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography (relief), organisms, and time.&lt;ref name="Jenny1941"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenny |first=Hans |title=Factors of soil formation: a system of qunatitative pedology |year=1941 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, New York |url=http://netedu.xauat.edu.cn/sykc/hjx/content/ckzl/6/2.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reordered to climate, relief, organisms, parent material, and time, they form the acronym CROPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthonlinemedia.com/ebooks/tpe_3e/title_page.html |title=The physical environment: an introduction to physical geography |first=Michael E. |last=Ritter |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parent material====
The mineral material from which a soil forms is called [[parent material]]. Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.

Typical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20–21}}
* [[Quartz]]: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Calcite]]: CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Lössacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]
Parent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.

Residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}

Most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.
* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60–90 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.
* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.
* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.
* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].

Cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.

=====Weathering=====
The [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable. Chemical decomposition is a function of mineral solubility, the rate of which doubles with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature, but is strongly dependent on water to effect chemical changes. Rocks that will decompose in a few years in tropical climates will remain unaltered for millennia in deserts.&lt;ref name="Gilluly1975"/&gt; Structural changes are the result of hydration, oxidation, and reduction. Chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of [[organic acids]] and [[chelating]] compounds by bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uroz |first1=Stéphane |last2=Calvaruso |first2=Christophe |last3=Turpault |first3=Marie-Pierre |last4=Frey-Klett |first4=Pascale |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009 |title=Mineral weathering by bacteria: ecology, actors and mechanisms |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=378–87 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X09001279 |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2009.05.004 |pmid=19660952 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungi,&lt;ref name="Landeweert2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landeweert |first1=Renske |last2=Hoffland |first2=Ellis |last3=Finlay |first3=Roger D. |last4=Kuyper |first4=Thom W. |last5=Van Breemen |first5=Nico |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Linking plants to rocks: ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize nutrients from minerals |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=248–54 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470102122X |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02122-X |pmid=11301154 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought to increase under present-day [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Schlesinger |first2=William H. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Soil CO2 dynamics, acidification, and chemical weathering in a temperate forest with experimental CO2 enrichment |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=149–62 |doi=10.1029/2000GB001278 |bibcode=2001GBioC..15..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Physical disintegration''' is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of "shells". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=28–31}} Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=346 |issue=6287 |pages=839–41 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242874418 |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saprolite]] is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals. Often called [weathered granite], saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: [[hydrolysis]], [[chelation]] from organic compounds, [[hydration reaction|hydration]] (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include [[freezing]] and [[thawing]]. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary [[bedrock]] material, its physical features, including grain size and degree of consolidation, and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called ''arenization'', resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite ([[micas]],  [[amphiboles]], [[feldspars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sequeira Braga |first1=Maria Amália |last2=Paquet |first2=Hélène |last3=Begonha |first3=Arlindo |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Weathering of granites in a temperate climate (NW Portugal): granitic saprolites and arenization |journal=Catena |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://home.uevora.pt/~lopes/Artigos/23.PDF |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00017-6 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate====
The principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective [[precipitation]] (i.e., precipitation minus [[evapotranspiration]]) and temperature, both of which affect the rates of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]]: the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Howard E. |last2=Burke |first2=Ingrid C. |last3=Lauenroth |first3=William K. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Regional patterns of decomposition and primary production rates in the U.S. Great Plains |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=320–27 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233379719 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0320:RPODAP]2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is the dominant factor in [[soil formation]], and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the [[climate zone]]s in which they form, with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt; If warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time, the processes of [[weathering]], [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and plant growth will be maximized. According to the climatic determination of [[biomes]], humid climates favor the growth of trees. In contrast, grasses are the dominant native vegetation in subhumid and [[semiarid]] regions, while shrubs and brush of various kinds dominate in arid areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodward |first1=F.

Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the [[regolith]]. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site [[topography]], and [[soil permeability]] interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers ([[eluviation]]) to the lower layers ([[illuviation]]), including clay particles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedoroff |first=Nicolas |year=1997 |title=Clay illuviation in Red Mediterranean soils |journal=Catena |volume=28 |issue=3/4 |pages=171–89 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816296000367 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00036-7 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dissolved organic matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michalzik |first1=Beate |last2=Kalbitz |first2=Karsten |last3=Park |first3=Ji-Hyung |last4=Solinger |first4=Stephan |last5=Matzner |first5=Egbert |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Fluxes and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen: a synthesis for temperate forests |journal=Biogeochemistry |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=173–205 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226356840 |doi=10.1023/A:1006441620810 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters.

Climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity, which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=Yves |year=2001 |title=The role of plants in controlling rates and products of weathering: importance of biological pumping |journal=[[Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences]] |volume=29 |pages=135–63 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228608786 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.29.1.135 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2001AREPS..29..135L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topography====
The [[topography]], or [[relief]], is characterized by the inclination ([[slope]]), [[elevation]], and orientation of the terrain. Topography determines the rate of precipitation or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and rate of formation or erosion of the surface [[soil profile]]. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.

Steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by [[erosion]] and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Baoyuan |last2=Nearing |first2=Mark A. |last3=Risse |first3=L. Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1994 |title=Slope gradient effects on soil loss for steep slopes |journal=Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1835–40 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270613706 |doi=10.13031/2013.28273 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[swales]] and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced. However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of [[wetland]] soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be [[saline marsh]]es or [[peat bog]]s. Intermediate topography affords the best conditions for the formation of an agriculturally productive soil.

The mineral components of soil are [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]], and their relative proportions determine a soil's texture. Properties that are influenced by soil texture include [[Pore space in soil|porosity]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[Shrink–swell capacity|shrink-swell rate]], [[Field capacity|water-holding capacity]], and susceptibility to [[erosion]]. In the illustrated USDA textural classification triangle, the only soil in which neither sand, silt nor clay predominates is called [[loam]]. While even pure sand, silt or clay may be considered a soil, from the perspective of conventional [[agriculture]] a loam soil with a small amount of organic material is considered "ideal", inasmuch as [[fertilizers]] or [[manure]] are currently used to mitigate nutrient losses due to [[crop yields]] in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haynes |first1=Richard J. |last2=Naidu |first2=Ravi |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems |volume=51 |issue=2 |title=Influence of lime, fertilizer and manure applications on soil organic matter content and soil physical conditions: a review |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225252692 |year=1998 |pages=123–37 |doi=10.1023/A:1009738307837 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral constituents of a loam soil might be 40% sand, 40% silt and the balance 20% clay by weight.

Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily [[quartz]] particles, ranging in size from {{convert|2.0|to|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Silt ranges in size from {{convert|0.05|to|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Clay cannot be resolved by optical microscopes as its particles are {{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}} or less in diameter and a thickness of only 10 [[angstroms]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m).{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Flemming|1957|p=331}} In medium-textured soils, clay is often washed downward through the soil profile (a process called [[eluviation]]) and accumulates in the subsoil (a process called [[illuviation]]). There is no clear relationship between the size of soil mineral components and their mineralogical nature: sand and silt particles can be [[calcareous]] as well as [[siliceous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/calcsand.html |title=Calcareous Sand |website=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while textural clay ({{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}) can be made of very fine quartz particles as well as of multi-layered secondary minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grim |first=Ralph E. |date=1953 |title=Clay mineralogy |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, NY |url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2037422/1/1334.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil mineral components belonging to a given textural class may thus share properties linked to their [[specific surface area]] (e.g. [[moisture retention]]) but not those linked to their chemical composition (e.g. [[cation exchange capacity]]).

Soil components larger than {{convert|2.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} are classed as rock and gravel and are removed before determining the percentages of the remaining components and the textural class of the soil, but are included in the name. For example, a sandy [[loam]] soil with 20% gravel would be called gravelly sandy loam.

When the organic component of a soil is substantial, the soil is called organic soil rather than mineral soil. A soil is called organic if:

# Mineral fraction is 0% clay and organic matter is 20% or more
# Mineral fraction is 0% to 50% clay and organic matter is between 20% and 30%
# Mineral fraction is 50% or more clay and organic matter 30% or more.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=53}}

Soil structure often gives clues to its texture, organic matter content, biological activity, past soil evolution, human use, and the chemical and mineralogical conditions under which the soil formed. While texture is defined by the mineral component of a soil and is an innate property of the soil that does not change with agricultural activities, soil structure can be improved or destroyed by the choice and timing of farming practices.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"/&gt;

Soil structural classes:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=55–56}}

# Types: '''Shape''' and arrangement of peds
## Platy: Peds are flattened one atop the other 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Found in the A-horizon of forest soils and lake sedimentation.
## Prismatic and Columnar: Prismlike peds are long in the vertical dimension, 10–100&amp;nbsp;mm wide. Prismatic peds have flat tops, columnar peds have rounded tops. Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.
## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5–50&amp;nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.
## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.
# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type
## Very fine or very thin: &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm platy and spherical; &lt;5&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &lt;10&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Fine or thin: 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Medium: 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 20–50 prismlike.
## Coarse or thick: 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 50–100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Very coarse or very thick: &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; &gt;50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &gt;100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.
## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.
## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.
## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.
## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.

At the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink–swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishné |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

===Consistency===
Consistency is the ability of soil to stick to itself or to other objects ([[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] and [[adhesion]], respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boekel |first1=P. |last2=Peerlkamp |first2=Petrus K. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |title=Soil consistency as a factor determining the soil structure of clay soils |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/211680 |year=1956 |pages=122–25 |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the engineering of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Robert W. |date=2000 |chapter=Soil mechanics and foundations |title=Building design and construction handbook |edition=6th |editor1-first=Frederick S. |editor1-last=Merritt |editor2-first=Jonathan T. |editor2-last=Rickett |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=New York, New York, USA |isbn=978-0070419995 |url=http://my.fit.edu/~locurcio/14-Civil%20&amp;%20Const%20handbooks/McGraw%20Hill%20-%20Design%20&amp;%20Const%20Handbook/06-Soils%20&amp;%20Foundations.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/CDrom/FAO_Training/FAO_Training/General/x6706e/x6706e08.htm |title=Soil consistency |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |location=Rome, Italy |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.

The terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:

# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard
# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm
# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic
# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62–63, 565–67}}

Soil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.

Soil [[heat flux]] refers to the rate at which [[heat energy]] moves through the soil in response to a temperature difference between two points in the soil. The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:

: &lt;math&gt;q_x  = - k \frac{\delta T}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[SI]] units
: &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.
: &lt;math&gt;\delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.

Heat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.

===Color===
{{Main|Soil color}}
Soil colour is often the first impression one has when viewing soil. Striking colours and contrasting patterns are especially noticeable. The [[Red River of the South]] carries sediment eroded from extensive reddish soils like [[Port Silt Loam]] in Oklahoma. The [[Yellow River]] in China carries yellow sediment from eroding loess soils. [[Mollisols]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America are darkened and enriched by organic matter. [[Podsol]]s in [[Taiga|boreal forests]] have highly contrasting layers due to acidity and leaching.

In general, color is determined by the organic matter content, drainage conditions, and degree of oxidation. Soil color, while easily discerned, has little use in predicting soil characteristics.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=71}} It is of use in distinguishing boundaries of [[Soil horizon|horizons]] within a soil profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sss/2014/03/30/soil-color-never-lies/ |publisher=[[European Geosciences Union]] |title=Soil color never lies |accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining the origin of a soil's [[parent material]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viscarra Rossel |first1=Raphael A. |last2=Cattle |first2=Stephen R. |last3=Ortega |first3=A. |last4=Fouad |first4=Youssef |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Geoderma |volume=150 |title=In situ measurements of soil colour, mineral composition and clay content by vis–NIR spectroscopy |year=2009 |pages=253–66 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an indication of wetness and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]] conditions,&lt;ref name="Blavet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blavet |first1=Didier |last2=Mathe |first2=E. |last3=Leprun |first3=Jean-Claude |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=39 |issue=3 |title=Relations between soil colour and waterlogging duration in a representative hillside of the West African granito-gneissic bedrock |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_55-56/010021572.pdf |year=2000 |pages=187–210 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00087-9 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a qualitative means of measuring organic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=J.

The rate at which a soil can absorb water depends on the soil and its other conditions. As a plant grows, its roots remove water from the largest pores ([[macropores]]) first. Soon the larger pores hold only air, and the remaining water is found only in the intermediate- and smallest-sized pores ([[micropores]]). The water in the smallest pores is so strongly held to particle surfaces that plant roots cannot pull it away. Consequently, not all soil water is available to plants, with a strong dependence on [[Soil texture|texture]].&lt;ref name="Easton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/75545/BSE-194.pdf |last1=Easton |first1=Zachary M. |last2=Bock |first2=Emily |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil and soil water relationships |website=[[Virginia Tech]] |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When saturated, the soil may lose nutrients as the water drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sims |first1=J.

===Water retention forces===
{{Further|Soil water (retention)|Water retention curve}}
Water is retained in a soil when the [[adhesive force]] of attraction that water's [[hydrogen]] atoms have for the [[oxygen]] of soil particles is stronger than the cohesive forces that water's hydrogen feels for other water oxygen atoms.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–74}} When a field is flooded, the soil [[pore space]] is completely filled by water. The field will drain under the force of gravity until it reaches what is called [[field capacity]], at which point the smallest pores are filled with water and the largest with water and gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of water held when field capacity is reached is a function of the [[specific surface area]] of the soil particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Lis Wollesen |last2=Møldrup |first2=Per |last3=Jacobsen |first3=Ole H. |last4=Rolston |first4=Dennis E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil Science |volume=161 |issue=1 |title=Relations between specific surface area and soil physical and chemical properties |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232162864 |year=1996 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199601000-00003 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, high clay and high organic soils have higher field capacities.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Satish C. |last2=Larson |first2=William E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Water Resources Research]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |title=Estimating soil water retention characteristics from particle size distribution, organic matter percent, and bulk density |year=1979 |pages=1633–5 |doi=10.1029/WR015i006p01633 |bibcode=1979WRR....15.1633G |citeseerx=10.1.1.475.497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total force required to pull or push water out of soil is termed [[suction]] and usually expressed in units of bars (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) which is just a little less than one-atmosphere pressure. Alternatively, the terms "soil moisture tension" or [[water potential]] may be used.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–75}}

===Moisture classification===
The forces with which water is held in soils determine its availability to plants. Forces of [[adhesion]] hold water strongly to mineral and humus surfaces and less strongly to itself by cohesive forces. A plant's root may penetrate a very small volume of water that is adhering to soil and be initially able to draw in water that is only lightly held by the cohesive forces. But as the droplet is drawn down, the forces of adhesion of the water for the soil particles produce increasingly higher [[suction]], finally up to 15&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=Michael J. |last2=Ritchie |first2=Joe T. |last3=Bland |first3=William L. |last4=Dugas |first4=William A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agronomy Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |title=Lower limit of soil water availability |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309079210 |year=1996 |pages=644–51 |doi=10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800040024x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15&amp;nbsp;bar suction, the soil water amount is called [[wilting point]]. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration, the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts, although [[stoma]]tal closure may decrease transpiration and thus may retard wilting below the [[wilting point]], in particular under [[adaptation]] or [[acclimatization]] to drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Ani |first1=Tariq |last2=Bierhuizen |first2=Johan Frederik |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Acta Botanica Neerlandica |volume=20 |issue=3 |title=Stomatal resistance, transpiration, and relative water content as influenced by soil moisture stress |url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/download?type=document&amp;docid=539770 |year=1971 |pages=318–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1971.tb00715.x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=75–76}}

===Soil moisture content===
{{see also|Soil moisture sensor|Moisture content}}
When the soil moisture content is optimal for plant growth, the water in the large and intermediate size pores can move about in the soil and be easily used by plants.&lt;ref name="Easton"/&gt; The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to field capacity and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type. Sandy soil will retain very little water, while clay will hold the maximum amount.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"/&gt; The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay [[loam]] that begins at 43% water by weight to a field capacity of 22% is six days, whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22% water will take two days to reach field capacity of 11% water. The available water for the clay loam might be 11% whereas for the sand loam it might be only 8% by weight.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=76–77}}

The above are average values for the soil textures as the percentages of sand, silt and clay vary.

===Water flow===
Water moves through soil due to the force of [[gravity]], [[osmosis]] and [[capillarity]]. At zero to one-third bar [[suction]], water is pushed through soil from the point of its application under the force of gravity and the pressure gradient created by the pressure of the water; this is called saturated flow. At higher suction, water movement is pulled by capillarity from wetter toward drier soil. This is caused by water's [[adhesion]] to soil solids, and is called unsaturated flow.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/AGRO103/lec03.pdf |title=Soil water movement: saturated and unsaturated flow and vapour movement, soil moisture constants and their importance in irrigation |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water infiltration and movement in soil is controlled by six factors:

# Soil texture
# Soil structure. Fine-textured soils with granular structure are most favourable to infiltration of water.
# The amount of organic matter. Coarse matter is best and if on the surface helps prevent the destruction of soil structure and the creation of crusts.
# Depth of soil to impervious layers such as hardpans or bedrock
# The amount of water already in the soil
# Soil temperature. Warm soils take in water faster while frozen soils may not be able to absorb depending on the type of freezing.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=86}}

Water infiltration rates range from {{convert|0.25|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for high clay soils to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for sand and well stabilised and aggregated soil structures.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=88}} Water flows through the ground unevenly, in the form of so-called "gravity fingers", because of the [[surface tension]] between water particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cueto-Felgueroso |first1=Luis |last2=Juanes |first2=Ruben |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=101 |issue=24 |title=Nonlocal interface dynamics and pattern formation in gravity-driven unsaturated flow through porous media |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bcee/6f04cc7a8bc8df98d0cb48410ccb1efb6a33.pdf |year=2008 |pages=244504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.244504 |pmid=19113626 |accessdate=21 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101x4504C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/research/pfweb/educators/intro/fingerflow.htm |title=Finger flow in coarse soils |website=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water uptake by plants===
Of equal importance to the storage and movement of water in soil is the means by which plants acquire it and their nutrients. Most soil water is taken up by plants as passive [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] caused by the pulling force of water evaporating ([[transpiration|transpiring]]) from the long column of water ([[xylem sap]] flow) that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves, according to the [[cohesion-tension theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aston |first1=M.

Root extension is vital for plant survival. A study of a single winter rye plant grown for four months in one cubic foot of loam soil showed that the plant developed 13,800,000 roots, a total of 385&amp;nbsp;miles in length with 2,550&amp;nbsp;square feet in surface area; and 14&amp;nbsp;billion hair roots of 6,600&amp;nbsp;miles total length and 4,320&amp;nbsp;square feet total area; for a total surface area of 6,870&amp;nbsp;square feet (83&amp;nbsp;ft squared). The total surface area of the loam soil was estimated to be 560,000&amp;nbsp;square feet.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=46}} In other words, the roots were in contact with only 1.2% of the soil. However, root extension should be viewed as a dynamic process, allowing new roots to explore a new volume of soil each day, increasing dramatically the total volume of soil explored over a given growth period, and thus the volume of water taken up by the root system over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Paul J. |last2=Coile |first2=Theodore S. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |title=An estimation of the volume of water made available by root extension |year=1940 |pages=743–7 |doi=10.1104/pp.15.4.743 |pmid=16653671 |pmc=437871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root architecture, i.e. the spatial configuration of the root system, plays a prominent role in the adaptation of plants to soil water and nutrient availabiity, and thus in plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=109 |issue=1 |title=Root architecture and plant productivity |year=1995 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.1.7 |pmid=12228579 |pmc=157559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots must seek out water as the unsaturated flow of water in soil can move only at a rate of up to 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (one inch) per day; as a result they are constantly dying and growing as they seek out high concentrations of soil moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comas |first1=Louise H. |last2=Eissenstat |first2=David M. |last3=Lakso |first3=Alan N. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |title=Assessing root death and root system dynamics in a study of grape canopy pruning |year=2000 |pages=171–8 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00679.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insufficient soil moisture, to the point of causing [[wilting]], will cause permanent damage and [[crop yield]]s will suffer.

===Consumptive use and water use efficiency===
Only a small fraction (0.1% to 1%) of the water used by a plant is held within the plant. The majority is ultimately lost via [[transpiration]], while [[evaporation]] from the soil surface is also substantial, the transpiration:evaporation ratio varying according to vegetation type and climate, peaking in [[tropical rainforests]] and dipping in [[steppes]] and [[deserts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=William H. |last2=Jasechko |first2=Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agricultural and Forest Meteorology]] |volume=189/190 |title=Transpiration in the global water cycle |url=http://www.isohydro.ca/uploads/1/4/1/9/14194300/2014-schlesinger-jasechko-agformet.pdf |year=2014 |pages=115–7 |doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.01.011 |accessdate=22 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2014AgFM..189..115S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration plus evaporative soil moisture loss is called [[evapotranspiration]].

The total water used in an agricultural field includes [[surface runoff]], [[drainage]] and consumptive use. The use of loose [[mulch]]es will reduce evaporative losses for a period after a field is irrigated, but in the end the total evaporative loss (plant plus soil) will approach that of an uncovered soil, while more water is immediately available for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tolk |first1=Judy A. |last2=Howell |first2=Terry A. |last3=Evett |first3=Steve R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=50 |issue=2 |title=Effect of mulch, irrigation, and soil type on water use and yield of maize |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=1896&amp;content=PDF |year=1999 |pages=137–47 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(99)00011-2 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water use efficiency]] is measured by the [[transpiration ratio]], which is the ratio of the total water transpired by a plant to the dry weight of the harvested plant. Transpiration ratios for crops range from 300 to 700. For example, alfalfa may have a transpiration ratio of 500 and as a result 500&amp;nbsp;kilograms of water will produce one&amp;nbsp;kilogram of dry alfalfa.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=97–99}}

==Atmosphere==
The atmosphere of soil, or [[soil gas]], is radically different from the atmosphere above. The consumption of [[oxygen]] by microbes and plant roots, and their release of [[carbon dioxide]], decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil [[pore space]] it may range from 10 to 100 times that level, thus potentially contributing to the inhibition of root respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Jingen |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Mattson |first3=Kim G. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=High soil carbon dioxide concentrations inhibit root respiration of Douglas fir |year=1994 |pages=435–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02989.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous soils regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration thanks to [[carbonate]] [[Buffering agent|buffering]], contrary to acid soils in which all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respired accumulates in the soil pore system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karberg |first1=Noah J. |last2=Pregitzer |first2=Kurt S. |last3=King |first3=John S. |last4=Friend |first4=Aaron L. |last5=Wood |first5=James R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |title=Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2004/nc_2004_Karberg_001.pdf |year=2005 |pages=296–306 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 |pmid=15378342 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At extreme levels CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=H.

* '''Illite''' is a 2:1 clay similar in structure to montmorillonite but has potassium bridges between the faces of the clay crystals and the degree of swelling depends on the degree of weathering of the potassium. The active surface area is reduced due to the potassium bonds. Illite originates from the modification of mica, a primary mineral. It is often found together with montmorillonite and its primary minerals. It has moderate CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=108–10}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Vermiculite''' is a mica-based clay similar to illite, but the crystals of clay are held together more loosely by hydrated magnesium and it will swell, but not as much as does montmorillonite. It has very high CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=73}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Chlorite''' is similar to vermiculite, but the loose bonding by occasional hydrated magnesium, as in vermiculite, is replaced by a hydrated magnesium sheet, that firmly bonds the planes above and below it. It has two planes of silicon, one of aluminium and one of magnesium; hence it is a 2:2 clay. Chlorite does not swell and it has low CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|p=112}}
* '''Kaolinite''' is very common, highly weathered clay, and more common than montmorillonite in acid soils. It has one silica and one alumina plane per crystal; hence it is a 1:1 type clay. One plane of silica of montmorillonite is dissolved and is replaced with hydroxyls, which produces strong hydrogen bonds to the oxygen in the next crystal of clay. As a result, kaolinite does not swell in water and has a low specific surface area, and as almost no isomorphous substitution has occurred it has a low CEC. Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite. Even heavier weathering results in sesquioxide clays.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=33}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=101}}

====Crystalline chain clays====
The carbonate and sulfate minerals are much more soluble and hence are found primarily in desert soils where leaching is less active.

====Amorphous clays====
'''Amorphous clays''' are young, and commonly found in volcanic ash. They are mixtures of alumina and silica which have not formed the ordered crystal shape of alumino-silica clays which time would provide. The majority of their negative charges originates from hydroxyl ions, which can gain or lose a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in response to soil pH, in such way was as to buffer the soil pH. They may have either a negative charge provided by the attached hydroxyl ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which can attract a cation, or lose the hydrogen of the hydroxyl to solution and display a positive charge which can attract anions. As a result, they may display either high CEC in an acid soil solution, or high anion exchange capacity in a basic soil solution.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}

====Sesquioxide clays====
'''[[Sesquioxide]] clays''' are a product of heavy rainfall that has leached most of the silica from alumino-silica clay, leaving the less soluble oxides iron hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), aluminium hydroxide gibbsite (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrated manganese birnessite (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It takes hundreds of thousands of years of leaching to create sesquioxide clays. ''Sesqui'' is Latin for "one and one-half": there are three parts oxygen to two parts iron or aluminium; hence the ratio is one and one-half (not true for all). They are hydrated and act as either amorphous or crystalline. They are not sticky and do not swell, and soils high in them behave much like sand and can rapidly pass water. They are able to hold large quantities of phosphates. Sesquioxides have low CEC but are able to hold anions as well as cations. Such soils range from yellow to red in colour. Such clays tend to hold phosphorus so tightly that it is unavailable for absorption by plants.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=103–12}}{{sfn|Simonson|1957|pp=18, 21–24, 29}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32, 35}}

===Organic colloids===
[[Humus]] is the final state of decomposition of organic matter. While it may linger for a thousand years, on the larger scale of the age of the mineral soil components, it is temporary. It is composed of the very stable [[lignin]]s (30%) and complex sugars ([[polyuronide]]s, 30%), proteins (30%), waxes, and fats that are resistant to breakdown by microbes. Its chemical assay is 60% carbon, 5% nitrogen, some oxygen and the remainder hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. On a dry weight basis, the CEC of humus is many times greater than that of clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=112}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=35}}{{sfn|Allaway|1957|p=69}}

===Carbon and terra preta===
In the extreme environment of high temperatures and the leaching caused by the heavy rain of tropical rain forests, the clay and organic colloids are largely destroyed. The heavy rains wash the alumino-silicate clays from the soil leaving only sesquioxide clays of low CEC. The high temperatures and humidity allow bacteria and fungi to virtually dissolve any organic matter on the rain-forest floor overnight and much of the nutrients are volatilized or leached from the soil and lost. However, carbon in the form of charcoal is far more stable than soil colloids and is capable of performing many of the functions of the soil colloids of sub-tropical soils. Soil containing substantial quantities of charcoal, of an anthropogenic origin, is called [[terra preta]]. Research into terra preta is still young but is promising. Fallow periods "on the Amazonian Dark Earths can be as short as 6 months, whereas fallow periods on [[oxisol]]s are usually 8 to 10 years long"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Terra Preta de Indio|url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|publisher=University of Cornell, Dept. of Crop and Soil Sciences|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424061552/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{for|the [[academic discipline]]|Soil chemistry}}

The chemistry of a soil determines its ability to supply available [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] and affects its physical properties and the health of its microbial population. In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its corrosivity, stability, and ability to absorb pollutants and to filter water. It is the surface chemistry of mineral and organic [[colloids]] that determines soil's chemical properties. "A colloid is a small, insoluble, nondiffusible particle larger than a molecule but small enough to remain suspended in a fluid medium without settling. Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called humus as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of clays." The very high [[specific surface area]] of colloids and their net charges, gives soil its ability to hold and release ions. Negatively charged sites on colloids attract and release cations in what is referred to as cation exchange. [[Cation-exchange capacity]] (CEC) is the amount of exchangeable cations per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of milliequivalents of positively charged ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg). Similarly, positively charged sites on colloids can attract and release anions in the soil giving the soil [[cation-exchange capacity|anion exchange capacity]] (AEC).

===Cation and anion exchange===
{{Further|Cation-exchange capacity}}
The cation exchange, that takes place between colloids and soil water, buffers (moderates) soil pH, alters soil structure, and purifies percolating water by adsorbing cations of all types, both useful and harmful.

The negative or positive charges on colloid particles make them able to hold cations or anions, respectively, to their surfaces. The charges result from four sources.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=103–06}}

# Isomorphous substitution occurs in clay during its formation, when lower-valence cations substitute for higher-valence cations in the crystal structure. Substitutions in the outermost layers are more effective than for the innermost layers, as the charge strength drops off as the square of the distance. The net result is oxygen atoms with net negative charge and the ability to attract cations.
# Edge-of-clay oxygen atoms are not in balance ionically as the tetrahedral and octahedral structures are incomplete.
# Hydroxyls may substitute for oxygens of the silica layers. When the hydrogens of the clay hydroxyls are ionised into solution, they leave the oxygen with a negative charge.
# Hydrogens of humus hydroxyl groups may be ionised into solution, leaving an oxygen with a negative charge.

Cations held to the negatively charged colloids resist being washed downward by water and out of reach of plants' roots, thereby preserving the fertility of soils in areas of moderate rainfall and low temperatures.

There is a hierarchy in the process of cation exchange on colloids, as they differ in the strength of adsorption by the colloid and hence their ability to replace one another. If present in equal amounts in the soil water solution:

Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; same as NH&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers. This is called mass action. This is largely what occurs with the addition of fertiliser.

As the soil solution becomes more acidic (low pH, and an abundance of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the other cations more weakly bound to colloids are pushed into solution as hydrogen ions occupy those sites. A low pH may cause hydrogen of hydroxyl groups to be pulled into solution, leaving charged sites on the colloid available to be occupied by other cations. This ionisation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of soil colloids creates what is described as pH-dependent charges. Unlike permanent charges developed by isomorphous substitution, pH-dependent charges are variable and increase with increasing pH.&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Freed cations can be made available to plants but are also prone to be leached from the soil, possibly making the soil less fertile. Plants are able to excrete H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the soil and by that means, change the pH of the soil near the root and push cations off the colloids, thus making those available to the plant.

====Cation exchange capacity (CEC)====
Cation exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that will combine with 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (1&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of dry soil or 20&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=114}} The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.

Most of the soil's CEC occurs on clay and humus colloids, and the lack of those in hot, humid, wet climates, due to leaching and decomposition respectively, explains the relative sterility of tropical soils. Live plant roots also have some CEC.

====Anion exchange capacity (AEC)====
Anion exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove anions from the soil water solution and sequester those for later exchange as the plant roots release carbonate anions to the soil water solution. Those colloids which have low CEC tend to have some AEC. Amorphous and sesquioxide clays have the highest AEC, followed by the iron oxides. Levels of AEC are much lower than for CEC. Phosphates tend to be held at anion exchange sites.

Iron and aluminum hydroxide clays are able to exchange their hydroxide anions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) for other anions. The order reflecting the strength of anion adhesion is as follows:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The amount of exchangeable anions is of a magnitude of tenths to a few milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;g dry soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=115–16}} As pH rises, there are relatively more hydroxyls, which will displace anions from the colloids and force them into solution and out of storage; hence AEC decreases with increasing pH (alkalinity).

===Reactivity (pH)===
{{Main|Soil pH|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Soil reactivity is expressed in terms of pH and is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. More precisely, it is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution and ranges in values from 0 to 14 (acidic to basic) but practically speaking for soils, pH ranges from 3.5 to 9.5, as pH values beyond those extremes are toxic to life forms.

At 25&amp;nbsp;°C an aqueous solution that has a pH of 3.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−3.5&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|moles]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (hydrogen ions) per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−10.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole/litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, they are said to neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−9.5&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−2.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole per litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more hydrogen ions per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 (9.5 - 3.5  = 6 or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) and is more acidic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=1984|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0394329833|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of pH on a soil is to remove from the soil or to make available certain ions. Soils with high acidity tend to have toxic amounts of aluminium and manganese. Plants which need calcium need moderate alkalinity, but most minerals are more soluble in acid soils. Soil organisms are hindered by high acidity, and most agricultural crops do best with mineral soils of pH&amp;nbsp;6.5 and organic soils of pH&amp;nbsp;5.5.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–17}}

In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain as those attach to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil sterile. Once the colloids are saturated with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH&amp;nbsp;10. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–19}}

====Base saturation percentage====
There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) and there are base-forming cations. The fraction of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the base saturation percentage. If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100&amp;nbsp;percent and there are no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=119–20}}

===Buffering===
{{Further|Soil conditioner}}
The resistance of soil to change in pH, as a result of the addition of acid or basic material, is a measure of the buffering capacity of a soil and (for a particular soil type) increases as the CEC increases. Hence, pure sand has almost no buffering ability, while soils high in colloids have high buffering capacity. Buffering occurs by cation exchange and neutralisation.

The addition of a small amount highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the ammonium to displace hydrogen ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but little permanent change overall in soil pH.

The addition of a small amount of [[liming (soil)|lime]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, will displace hydrogen ions from the soil colloids, causing the fixation of calcium to colloids and the evolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with little permanent change in soil pH.

The above are examples of the buffering of soil pH. The general principal is that an increase in a particular cation in the soil water solution will cause that cation to be fixed to colloids (buffered) and a decrease in solution of that cation will cause it to be withdrawn from the colloid and moved into solution (buffered). The degree of buffering is often related to the CEC of the soil; the greater the CEC, the greater the buffering capacity of the soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=120–21}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Plant nutrition|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Sixteen elements or nutrients are essential for plant growth and reproduction. They are [[carbon]] '''C''', [[hydrogen]] '''H''', [[oxygen]] '''O''', [[nitrogen]] '''N''', [[phosphorus]] '''P''', [[potassium]] '''K''', [[sulfur]] '''S''', [[calcium]] '''Ca''', [[magnesium]] '''Mg''', [[iron]] '''Fe''', [[boron]] '''B''', [[manganese]] '''Mn''', [[copper]] '''Cu''', [[zinc]] '''Zn''', [[molybdenum]] '''Mo''', [[nickel]] '''Ni''' and [[chlorine]] '''Cl'''.{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Russel|1957|pp=123–25}}&lt;ref name = BradyWeil&gt;{{cite book | title = The nature and properties of soils | year = 2008 | edition = 14th | last1 = Brady | first1 = Nyle C. | last2 = Weil | first2 = Ray R. | publisher = Pearson | location = Upper Saddle River, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients required for plants to complete their life cycle are considered '''essential nutrients'''. Nutrients that enhance the growth of plants but are not necessary to complete the plant's life cycle are considered '''non-essential'''. With the exception of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are supplied by carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen, provided through [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; the nutrients derive originally from the mineral component of the soil.

Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form. In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an ionic form from (or together with) soil water. Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within primary and secondary minerals, they [[weathering|weather]] too slowly to support rapid plant growth. For example, The application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80–81}}

The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and [[soil organic matter]] provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished – this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=|isbn=978-9251054901|location=Rome|pages=43–90|chapter=Chapter 4: Soil fertility and crop production|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram for gram, the capacity of humus to hold nutrients and water is far greater than that of clay minerals. All in all, small amounts of humus may remarkably increase the soil's capacity to promote plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–31}}&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;

===Uptake processes===
Nutrients in the soil are taken up by the plant through its roots. To be taken up by a plant, a nutrient element must be located near the root surface; however, the supply of nutrients in contact with the root is rapidly depleted. There are three basic mechanisms whereby nutrient ions dissolved in the soil solution are brought into contact with plant roots:

# Mass flow of water
# Diffusion within water
# Interception by root growth

All three mechanisms operate simultaneously, but one mechanism or another may be most important for a particular nutrient. For example, in the case of calcium, which is generally plentiful in the soil solution, mass flow alone can usually bring sufficient amounts to the root surface. However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion of molecules. By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as transpiration has almost stopped. Finally, root interception comes into play as roots continually grow into new, undepleted soil.

In the above table, phosphorus and potassium nutrients move more by diffusion than they do by mass flow in the soil water solution, as they are rapidly taken up by the roots creating a concentration of almost zero near the roots (the plants cannot transpire enough water to draw more of those nutrients near the roots). The very steep concentration gradient is of greater influence in the movement of those ions than is the movement of those by mass flow.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement by mass flow requires the transpiration of water from the plant causing water and solution ions to also move toward the roots. Movement by root interception is slowest as the plants must extend their roots.

Plants move ions out of their roots in an effort to move nutrients in from the soil. Hydrogen H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is exchanged for other cations, and carbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) anions are exchanged for nutrient anions. As plant roots remove nutrients from the soil water solution, they are replenished as other ions move off of clay and humus (by [[ion exchange]] or [[desorption]]), are added from the [[weathering]] of soil minerals, and are released by the [[Soil organic matter#Decomposition|decomposition of soil organic matter]]. Plants derive a large proportion of their anion nutrients from decomposing organic matter, which typically holds about 95&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil nitrogen, 5 to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil phosphorus and about 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil sulfur. Where crops are produced, the replenishment of nutrients in the soil must usually be augmented by the addition of fertilizer or organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=126}}

Because nutrient uptake is an active metabolic process, conditions that inhibit root metabolism may also inhibit nutrient uptake. Examples of such conditions include [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] or [[soil compaction]] resulting in poor soil aeration, excessively high or low soil temperatures, and above-ground conditions that result in low translocation of sugars to plant roots.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–28}}

===Carbon===
[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring soil respiration in the field using an SRS2000 system.]]
Plants obtain their carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. About 45% of a plant's dry mass is carbon; plant residues typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of between 13:1 and 100:1. As the soil organic material is digested by arthropods and micro-organisms, the C/N decreases as the carbonaceous material is metabolized and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released as a byproduct which then finds its way out of the soil and into the atmosphere. The nitrogen is sequestered in the bodies of the living matter of those decomposing organisms and so it builds up in the soil. Normal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere is 0.03%, this can be the factor limiting plant growth. In a field of maize on a still day during high light conditions in the growing season, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration drops very low, but under such conditions the crop could use up to 20 times the normal concentration. The respiration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by soil micro-organisms decomposing soil organic matter contributes an important amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the photosynthesising plants. Within the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the soil porosity is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=41}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|p=153}}

===Nitrogen===
{{Further|Nitrogen cycle}}
[[File:SoilNitrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Generalization of percent soil nitrogen by soil order}}]]
Nitrogen is the most critical element obtained by plants from the soil and [[nitrogen deficiency]] often limits plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=128}} Plants can use the nitrogen as either the ammonium cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or the anion nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Usually, most of the nitrogen in soil is bound within organic compounds that make up the soil organic matter, and must be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] to the ammonium or nitrate form before it can be taken up by most plants. The total nitrogen content depends largely on the soil organic matter content, which in turn depends on the climate, vegetation, topography, age and soil management. Soil nitrogen typically decreases by 0.2 to 0.3% for every temperature increase by 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Usually, grassland soils contain more soil nitrogen than forest soils. Cultivation decreases soil nitrogen by exposing soil organic matter to decomposition by microorganisms, and soils under no-tillage maintain more soil nitrogen than tilled soils.

Some micro-organisms are able to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called ''mineralisation''. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are capable of metabolising N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the form of ammonia in a process called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Both ammonium and nitrate can be ''immobilized'' by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered in the form of amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called ''denitrification''. Nitrogen may also be ''leached'' from the soil if it is in the form of nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called ''volatilisation''. Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by ''fixation''. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Allison|1957|pp=85–94}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|pp=152–55}}{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–31}}

====Gains====
In the process of [[mineralization (soil)|mineralisation]], microbes feed on organic matter, releasing ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and other nutrients. As long as the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of fresh residues in the soil is above 30:1, nitrogen will be in short supply and other bacteria will feed on the ammonium and incorporate its nitrogen into their cells in the [[immobilization (soil science)|immobilization]] process. In that form the nitrogen is said to be ''immobilised''. Later, when such bacteria die, they too are ''mineralised'' and some of the nitrogen is released as ammonium and nitrate. If the C/N is less than 15, ammonia is freed to the soil, where it may be used by bacteria which [[redox|oxidise]] it to nitrate ([[nitrification]]). Bacteria may on average add {{convert|25|lb}} nitrogen per acre, and in an unfertilised field, this is the most important source of usable nitrogen. In a soil with 5% organic matter perhaps 2 to 5% of that is released to the soil by such decomposition. It occurs fastest in warm, moist, well aerated soil. The mineralisation of 3% of the organic material of a soil that is 4% organic matter overall, would release {{convert|120|lb}} of nitrogen as ammonium per acre.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=129–30}}

In [[nitrogen fixation]], [[rhizobium]] bacteria convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Rhizobia]] share a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with host plants, since rhizobia supply the host with nitrogen and the host provides rhizobia with nutrients and a safe environment. It is estimated that such symbiotic bacteria in the [[root nodule]]s of [[legume]]s add 45 to 250&amp;nbsp;pounds of nitrogen per acre per year, which may be sufficient for the crop. Other, free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and [[blue-green algae]] live independently in the soil and release nitrate when their dead bodies are converted by way of mineralisation.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–29}}

Some amount of usable nitrogen is fixed by [[lightning]] as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide is soluble in water to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, previously released from the soil or from combustion, may fall with precipitation as nitric acid at a rate of about five pounds nitrogen per acre per year.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=87}}

====Sequestration====
When bacteria feed on soluble forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), they temporarily sequester that nitrogen in their bodies in a process called ''immobilisation''. At a later time when those bacteria die, their nitrogen may be released as ammonium by the processes of mineralisation.

Protein material is easily broken down, but the rate of its decomposition is slowed by its attachment to the crystalline structure of clay and when trapped between the clay layers. The layers are small enough that bacteria cannot enter. Some organisms can exude extracellular enzymes that can act on the sequestered proteins. However, those enzymes too may be trapped on the clay crystals.

Ammonium fixation occurs when ammonium pushes [[potassium]] ions from between the layers of clay such as [[illite]] or [[montmorillonite]]. Only a small fraction of soil nitrogen is held this way.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}

====Losses====
Usable nitrogen may be lost from soils when it is in the form of nitrate, as it is easily [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]]. Further losses of nitrogen occur by denitrification, the process whereby soil bacteria convert nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitrogen gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This occurs when poor [[soil aeration]] limits free oxygen, forcing bacteria to use the oxygen in nitrate for their respiratory process. Denitrification increases when oxidisable organic material is available and when soils are warm and slightly acidic. Denitrification may vary throughout a soil as the aeration varies from place to place. Denitrification may cause the loss of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of the available nitrates within a day and when conditions are favourable to that process, losses of up to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of nitrate applied as fertiliser may occur.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=130}}

''Ammonium volatilisation'' occurs when ammonium reacts chemically with an alkaline soil, converting NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of ammonium fertiliser to such a field can result in volatilisation losses of as much as 30 percent.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Phosphorus===
After nitrogen, phosphorus is probably the element most likely to be deficient in soils. The soil mineral [[apatite]] is the most common mineral source of phosphorus. While there is on average 1000&amp;nbsp;lb of phosphorus per acre in the soil, it is generally in the form of phosphates with low solubility. Total phosphorus is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;percent by weight of the soil, but only one percent of that is available. Of the part available, more than half comes from the mineralisation of organic matter. Agricultural fields may need to be fertilised to make up for the phosphorus that has been removed in the crop.{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}

When phosphorus does form solubilised ions of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, they rapidly form insoluble phosphates of calcium or hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum. Phosphorus is largely immobile in the soil and is not leached but actually builds up in the surface layer if not cropped. The application of soluble fertilisers to soils may result in zinc deficiencies as zinc phosphates form. Conversely, the application of zinc to soils may immobilise phosphorus again as zinc phosphate. Lack of phosphorus may interfere with the normal opening of the plant leaf stomata, resulting in plant temperatures 10 percent higher than normal. Phosphorus is most available when soil pH is 6.5 in mineral soils and 5.5 in organic soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Potassium===
The amount of potassium in a soil may be as much as 80,000&amp;nbsp;lb per acre-foot, of which only 150&amp;nbsp;lb is available for plant growth. Common mineral sources of potassium are the mica [[biotite]] and potassium feldspar, KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. When solubilised, half will be held as exchangeable cations on clay while the other half is in the soil water solution. Potassium fixation often occurs when soils dry and the potassium is bonded between layers of illite clay. Under certain conditions, dependent on the soil texture, intensity of drying, and initial amount of exchangeable potassium, the fixed percentage may be as much as 90&amp;nbsp;percent within ten minutes. Potassium may be leached from soils low in clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|pp=101–04}}

===Calcium===
Calcium is one percent by weight of soils and is generally available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached. It is thus low in sandy and heavily leached soil or strongly acidic mineral soil. Calcium is supplied to the plant in the form of exchangeable ions and moderately soluble minerals. Calcium is more available on the soil colloids than is potassium because the common mineral calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is more soluble than potassium-bearing minerals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=135–36}}

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is one of the dominant exchangeable cations in most soils (as are calcium and potassium). Primary minerals that weather to release magnesium include [[hornblende]], [[biotite]] and [[vermiculite]]. Soil magnesium concentrations are generally sufficient for optimal plant growth, but highly weathered and sandy soils may be magnesium deficient due to leaching by heavy precipitation.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}}

===Sulfur===
Most sulfur is made available to plants, like phosphorus, by its release from decomposing organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}} Deficiencies may exist in some soils (especially sandy soils) and if cropped, sulfur needs to be added. The application of large quantities of nitrogen to fields that have marginal amounts of sulfur may cause sulfur deficiency in the rapidly growing plants by the plant's growth outpacing the supply of sulfur. A 15-ton crop of onions uses up to 19&amp;nbsp;lb of sulfur and 4&amp;nbsp;tons of alfalfa uses 15&amp;nbsp;lb per acre. Sulfur abundance varies with depth. In a sample of soils in Ohio, United States, the sulfur abundance varied with depths, 0-6&amp;nbsp;inches, 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches, 12-18&amp;nbsp;inches, 18-24&amp;nbsp;inches in the amounts: 1056, 830, 686, 528&amp;nbsp;lb per acre respectively.{{sfn|Jordan|Reisenauer|1957|p=107}}

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients essential in plant life, in their order of importance, include  [[iron]],{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|pp=111}} [[manganese]],{{sfn|Sherman|1957|p=135}} [[zinc]],{{sfn|Seatz|Jurinak|1957|p=115}} [[copper]],{{sfn|Reuther|1957|p=128}} [[boron]],{{sfn|Russel|1957|p=121}} [[chlorine]]{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=146}} and [[molybdenum]].{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=141}} The term refers to plants' needs, not to their abundance in soil. They are required in very small amounts but are essential to plant health in that most are required parts of some enzyme system which speeds up plants' metabolisms. They are generally available in the mineral component of the soil, but the heavy application of phosphates can cause a deficiency in zinc and iron by the formation of insoluble zinc and iron phosphates. Iron deficiency may also result from excessive amounts of heavy metals or calcium minerals (lime) in the soil. Excess amounts of soluble boron, molybdenum and chloride are toxic.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=107}}

===Non-essential nutrients===
Nutrients which enhance the health but whose deficiency does not stop the life cycle of plants include: [[cobalt]], [[strontium]], [[vanadium]], [[silicon]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria Pereira|first1=B.F.|title=Nutrients and Nonessential Elements in Soil after 11 Years of Wastewater Irrigation|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/3/920|website=ACSESS Digital Library|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their importance are evaluated they may be added to the list of essential plant nutrients.

==Soil organic matter==
{{main|Soil organic matter}}
Soil organic matter is made up of [[organic compounds]] and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead. A typical soil has a biomass composition of 70% microorganisms, 22% macrofauna, and 8% roots. The living component of an acre of soil may include 900&amp;nbsp;lb of earthworms, 2400&amp;nbsp;lb of fungi, 1500&amp;nbsp;lb of bacteria, 133&amp;nbsp;lb of protozoa and 890&amp;nbsp;lb of arthropods and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pimentel, D.|display-authors=etal|year=1995|title=Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=267|pages=1117–22|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1117P |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5201.1117|issue=24|pmid=17789193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small part of the organic matter consists of the living cells such as bacteria, molds, and actinomycetes that work to break down the dead organic matter. Were it not for the action of these micro-organisms, the entire carbon dioxide part of the atmosphere would be sequestered as organic matter in the soil.

Chemically, organic matter is classed as follows:

# Polysaccharides
## cellulose
## hemicellulose
## starch
## pectin
# Lignins
# Proteins

Most living things in soils, including plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi, are dependent on organic matter for nutrients and/or energy. Soils have organic compounds in varying degrees of decomposition which rate is dependent on the temperature, soil moisture, and aeration. Bacteria and fungi feed on the raw organic matter, which are fed upon by amoebas, which in turn are fed upon by nematodes and arthropods. Organic matter holds soils open, allowing the infiltration of air and water, and may hold as much as twice its weight in water. Many soils, including desert and rocky-gravel soils, have little or no organic matter. Soils that are all organic matter, such as [[peat]] ([[histosols]]), are infertile.&lt;ref name=Foth1984&gt;{{Cite book | last = Foth | first = Henry D. | year = 1984 | title = Fundamentals of soil science | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0471889267 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter. The final stage of decomposition is called humus.

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

===Humus===
[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil flora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown. Humus usually constitutes only five percent of the soil or less by volume, but it is an essential source of nutrients and adds important textural qualities crucial to [[soil health]] and plant growth. Humus also hold bits of undecomposed organic matter which feed arthropods and worms which further improve the soil. The end product, humus, is soluble in water and forms a weak acid that can attack silicate minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilluly, Waters, Woodford|title=Principles of Geology|year=1975|edition=4th|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=USA|isbn=978-0716702696|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humus is a colloid with a high cation and anion exchange capacity that on a dry weight basis is many times greater than that of clay colloids. It also acts as a buffer, like clay, against changes in pH and soil moisture.

[[Humic acid]]s and [[fulvic acid]]s, which begin as raw organic matter, are important constituents of humus. After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.

Lignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.&lt;ref name=Verkaik2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) forests |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=287 |pages=337–45 |doi=10.1007/s11104-006-9081-8 |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/25615 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fierer2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fierer |first=N. |last2=Schimel |first2=Joshua P. |last3=Cates |first3=Rex G. |last4=Zou |first4=Jiping |title=Influence of balsam poplar tannin fractions on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Alaskan taiga floodplain soils |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |date=2001 |volume=33 |pages=1827–39 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00111-0 |issue=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humus formation is a process dependent on the amount of plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].&lt;ref name="Foth1984"/&gt; Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing soil [[porosity]]. Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter. However, humus may persist over centuries if not millennia.

===Climatological influence===

==Horizons==
{{Main|Soil horizon}}

A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, is referred to as a [[soil horizon]]. The naming of a horizon is based on the type of material of which it is composed. Those materials reflect the duration of specific processes of soil formation. They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers&lt;ref name=Retallack1990&gt;{{Cite book| last = Retallack | first = G.

Some may have only one horizon.

The exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.

==Classification==
{{main|Soil classification}}

Soil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil for a particular use. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications. The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB)&lt;ref name=IUSS2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=IUSS Working Group WRB|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014.

====United States====
{{Main|USDA soil taxonomy#Orders}}

A taxonomy is an arrangement in a systematic manner; the  [[USDA soil taxonomy]] has six levels of classification. They are, from most general to specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family and series. Soil properties that can be measured quantitatively are used in this classification system – they include: depth, moisture, temperature, texture, structure, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, clay mineralogy, organic matter content and salt content. There are 12 soil orders (the top hierarchical level) in soil taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html The Soil Orders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112143347/http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html |date=12 January 2010 }}, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=411–32}}  The names of the orders end with the suffix ''-sol''. The criteria for the different soil orders include properties that reflect major differences in the genesis of soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soil Survey Staff|title=Soil taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys. 2nd edition.

* [[Alfisol]] – soils with [[aluminium]] and [[iron]]. They have horizons of clay accumulation, and form where there is enough moisture and warmth for at least three months of plant growth. They constitute 10% of soils worldwide.
* [[Andisol]] – volcanic ash soils. They are young and very fertile. They cover 1% of the world's ice-free surface.
* [[Aridisol]] – dry soils forming under [[desert]] conditions which have fewer than 90 consecutive days of moisture during the growing season and are nonleached. They include nearly 12% of soils on Earth. Soil formation is slow, and accumulated organic matter is scarce. They may have subsurface zones of [[caliche]] or [[duripan]]. Many aridisols have well-developed Bt horizons showing clay movement from past periods of greater moisture.
* [[Entisol]] – recently formed soils that lack well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments of sand and clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.
* [[Gelisol]] – permafrost soils with permafrost within two metres of the surface or gelic materials and permafrost within one metre. They constitute 9% of soils worldwide.
* [[Histosol]] – organic soils, formerly called bog soils, are 1% of soils worldwide.
* [[Inceptisol]] – young soils. They have subsurface horizon formation but show little eluviation and illuviation. They constitute 15% of soils worldwide.
* [[Mollisol]] – soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons. They are 7% of soils worldwide.
* [[Oxisol]] – are heavily [[weathered]], are rich in iron and aluminum oxides ([[sesquioxides]]) or [[kaolin]] but low in [[silica]]. They have only trace nutrients due to heavy tropical rainfall and high temperatures and low [[Cation-exchange capacity|CEC]] of the remaining clays. They are 8% of soils worldwide.
* [[Spodosol]] – acid soils with organic colloid layer complexed with iron and aluminium leached from a layer above. They are typical soils of [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous forest]]s in cooler climates. They constitute 4% of soils worldwide.
* [[Ultisol]] – acid soils in the humid tropics and subtropics, which are depleted in [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] (important [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]]). They are highly [[weathered]], but not as weathered as Oxisols. They make up 8% of the soil worldwide.
* [[Vertisol]] – inverted soils. They are clay-rich and tend to swell when wet and shrink upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.

"Soils of Mountains", which constitute the balance (11.6%), have a mixture of those listed above, or are classified as "Rugged Mountains" which have no soil.

The above soil orders in sequence of increasing degree of development are Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. Histosols and Vertisols may appear in any of the above at any time during their development.

The '''soil suborders''' within an order are differentiated on the basis of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven suborders are recognized in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The '''soil great group''' category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another. About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, iron, humus and hard pans and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The great group categories are divided into three kinds of '''soil subgroups''': typic, intergrade and extragrade. A typic subgroup represents the basic or 'typical' concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

A '''soil family''' category is a group of soils within a subgroup and describes the physical and chemical properties which affect the response of soil to agricultural management and engineering applications. The principal characteristics used to differentiate soil families include texture, mineralogy, pH, permeability, structure, consistency, the locale's precipitation pattern, and soil temperature. For some soils the criteria also specify the percentage of silt, sand and coarse fragments such as gravel, cobbles and rocks. About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=409–10}}

A family may contain several '''soil series''' which describe the physical location using the name of a prominent physical feature such as a river or town near where the soil sample was taken. An example would be Merrimac for the [[Merrimack River]] in New Hampshire. More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States. This permits very specific descriptions of soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

A '''soil phase of series''', originally called 'soil type' describes the soil surface texture, slope, stoniness, saltiness, erosion, and other conditions.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

==Uses==
Soil is used in agriculture, where it serves as the anchor and primary nutrient base for plants; however, as demonstrated by [[hydroponics]], it is not essential to plant growth if the soil-contained nutrients can be dissolved in a solution. The types of soil and available moisture determine the species of plants that can be cultivated.

Soil material is also a critical component in the mining, construction and landscape development industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Soils for Landscape Development |author1=Leake, Simon|author2=Haege, Elke|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-0643109643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil serves as a foundation for most construction projects. The movement of massive volumes of soil can be involved in [[surface mining]], road building and dam construction. [[Earth sheltering]] is the architectural practice of using soil for external [[thermal mass]] against building walls. Many [[building material]]s are soil based.

Soil resources are critical to the environment, as well as to food and fibre production. Soil provides minerals and water to plants. Soil absorbs rainwater and releases it later, thus preventing floods and drought. Soil cleans water as it percolates through it. Soil is the habitat for many organisms: the major part of known and unknown [[biodiversity]] is in the soil, in the form of [[invertebrates]] ([[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[mite]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[Enchytraeidae|enchytraeids]], [[nematode]]s, [[protist]]s), [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], fungi and [[algae]]; and most organisms living above ground have part of them ([[plants]]) or spend part of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[insects]]) below-ground. Above-ground and below-ground biodiversities are tightly interconnected,&lt;ref name="Ponge2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ponge| first = Jean-François| year = 2003| title = Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity| journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume = 35| issue = 7| pages = 935–45| doi = 10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00149-4| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| format = PDF| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129153903/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| archivedate = 29 January 2016| df = dmy-all| citeseerx = 10.1.1.467.4937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Deyn2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Deyn |first=Gerlinde B. |last2=Van der Putten |first2=Wim H. |date=2005 |title=Linking aboveground and belowground diversity |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |pages=625–33 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.08.009 |pmid=16701446 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making soil protection of paramount importance for any restoration or conservation plan.

The biological component of soil is an extremely important carbon sink since about 57% of the biotic content is carbon. Even on desert crusts, cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses capture and sequester a significant amount of carbon by photosynthesis. Poor farming and grazing methods have degraded soils and released much of this sequestered carbon to the atmosphere. Restoring the world's soils could offset the effect of increases in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and slow global warming, while improving crop yields and reducing water needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Hansen, J. |display-authors = etal |journal=Open Atmospheric Science Journal|year=2008|volume= 2|issue = 1 |pages= 217–31 | title=Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?|arxiv = 0804.1126 |bibcode = 2008OASJ....2..217H |doi = 10.2174/1874282300802010217|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Waste management]] often has a soil component. [[Septic drain field]]s treat [[septic tank]] effluent using aerobic soil processes. [[Landfill]]s use soil for [[daily cover]]. Land application of waste water relies on soil biology to aerobically treat [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]].

Organic soils, especially [[peat]], serve as a significant fuel resource; but wide areas of peat production, such as [[sphagnum]] [[bog]]s, are now protected because of patrimonial interest.

[[Geophagy]] is the practice of eating soil-like substances. Both animals and human cultures occasionally consume soil for medicinal, recreational, or religious purposes.

Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].

[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation.

[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.

[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.

A serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.

Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602–10 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | postscript = . | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater. [[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] with higher levels of applied water in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands | year = 1993 | publisher = Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 978-0160616235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816225219/http://www.waterlog.info/ |archivedate=16 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclamation==
Soils which contain high levels of particular clays, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.

Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.

In 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.&lt;ref name="Water Management Institute2010"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all |author=International Water Management Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition. Adding organic matter (like [[ramial chipped wood]] for instance) to soil which is depleted in nutrients and too high in sand will boost its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Provide for your garden's basic needs ... and the plants will take it from there|date=10 March 2011|journal=USA Weekend|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209012951/http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spaceship Earth''' or '''Spacecraft Earth''' is a [[world view]] encouraging everyone on [[Earth]] to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.

From book IV, chapter 2: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say, "This is mine!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[George Orwell]] later paraphrases Henry George in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world is a raft sailing through space with, potentially, plenty of provisions for everybody; the idea that we must all cooperate and see to it that everyone does his fair share of the work and gets his fair share of the provisions seems so blatantly obvious that one would say that no one could possibly fail to accept it unless he had some corrupt motive for clinging to the present system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965 [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] made a famous speech to the UN in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/477.html Speech to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, July 9, 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following year, ''Spaceship Earth'' became the title of a book by a friend of Stevenson's, the internationally influential economist [[Barbara Ward]].

Also in 1966, [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], who was influenced by reading [[Henry George]],&lt;ref&gt;King, J. E. "Economic Exiles". Palgrave Macmillan, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; used the phrase in the title of an essay, ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page160.htm|title=The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth|first=Kenneth E.|last=Boulding|authorlink=Kenneth E. Boulding|date=1966|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boulding described the past open [[economy]] of apparently illimitable resources, which he said he was tempted to call the "cowboy economy", and continued: "The closed economy of the future might similarly be called the 'spaceman' economy, in which the earth has become a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system".
([[David Korten]] would take up the "cowboys in a spaceship" theme in his 1995 book ''[[When Corporations Rule the World]]''.)

The phrase was also popularized by [[Buckminster Fuller]], who published a book in 1968 under the title of ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Buckminster|last=Fuller|authorlink=Buckminster Fuller|publisher=E.P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;…we can make all of humanity successful through science's world-engulfing industrial evolution provided that we are not so foolish as to continue to exhaust in a split second of astronomical history the orderly energy savings of billions of years' energy conservation aboard our Spaceship Earth.  These energy savings have been put into our Spaceship's life-regeneration-guaranteeing bank account for use only in self-starter functions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]] spoke of Spaceship Earth on [[Earth Day]] March 21, 1971 at the ceremony of the ringing of the [[Japanese Peace Bell]]: "May there only be peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowzone.com/mc-lee.htm|title=Earth Day: Past, Present, Future|first=Lee|last=Lawrence|author2=John McConnell |date=July 3, 1999|publisher=Wish Only Well|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spaceship Earth 2.jpg|thumb|Epcot's Spaceship Earth]]

Spaceship Earth is the name given to the 50&amp;nbsp;m diameter [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] that greets visitors at the entrance of [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Epcot]] theme park. Housed within the sphere is [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|a dark ride]] that serves to explore the history of [[communications]] and promote Epcot's founding principles, "[a] belief and pride in man's ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=WDW Chronicles: 1982 Opening of Epcot Center|website=http://allears.net/ae/issue678.htm|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous incarnation of the ride, narrated by actor [[Jeremy Irons]] and revised in 2008, was explicit in its message:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time, and for a brief moment, we have been among its many passengers….We now have the ability and the responsibility to build new bridges of acceptance and co-operation between us, to create a better world for ourselves and our children as we continue our amazing journey aboard Spaceship Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Irons|first1=Jeremy|title=SE Script - Irons Version|website=http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Deutsch]] has pointed out that the picture of Earth as a friendly "spaceship" habitat is difficult to defend even in metaphorical sense. The Earth environment is harsh and survival is constant struggle for life, including whole species [[extinction]]. Humans wouldn't be able to live in most of the areas where they are living now without knowledge necessary to build life-support systems such as houses, heating, water supply, etc.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=David Deutsch |author-link=David Deutsch |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Spaceship Earth" is frequently used on the labels of [[Emanuel Bronner]]'s products to refer to the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

'''Stone walls''' are a kind of [[masonry]] construction that has been used for thousands of years.  The first stone walls were constructed by farmers and primitive people by piling loose field stones into a [[dry stone wall]]. Later, [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[plaster]] were used, especially in the construction of [[city wall]]s, [[castle]]s, and other [[fortification]]s before and during the [[Middle Ages]]. These stone walls are spread throughout the world in different forms. One of the best example is the Cyclopean Wall in Rajgir, India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travelnewsindia.com/cyclopean-wall-rajgir/|title=The Cyclopean Wall Rajgir|date=2017-03-07|work=Travel News India|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Stone walls are usually made of local materials varying from [[limestone]] and [[flint]] to [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. However, the quality of building stone varies greatly, both in its endurance to [[weathering]], resistance to [[water]] penetration and in its ability to be worked into regular shapes before construction. Worked stone is usually known as [[ashlar]], and is often used for corners in stone buildings. [[Granite]] is very resistant to weathering, while some limestones are very weak. Other limestones, such as [[Portland stone]], are more weather-resistant.

==Dimensions==
Large structures are usually made of very thick walls, so that castles and cathedrals possess walls which may be up to 12 feet thick. They normally consist of a layered stone exterior and [[rubble]] infill.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|220px|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] illustrations of [[beak]] variation in the [[Darwin's finches|finches]] of the [[Galápagos Islands]].]]

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have. Parents allocate more resources to their offspring with higher reproductive value (e.g., "mom always liked you best"). Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions.

| [[Herbert Gintis]] (2000, 2003) and others
| '''''[[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)#Patterns of reciprocity|Generalized Reciprocity]]'''''

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16152">'''Ultra-high vacuum''' ('''UHV''') is the [[vacuum]] regime characterised by [[pressure]]s lower than about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] or 100 nanopascals (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[milli|m]][[Bar (unit)|bar]], ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the [[mean free path]] of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km, so the gas is in [[free molecular flow]], and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.

UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. [[Surface science]] experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted [[Adsorption|adsorbates]]. Surface analysis tools such as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] and [[low energy ion scattering]] require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] are kept at UHV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]] of gases
* Gas transport and pumping
* [[Vacuum pump]]s and [[vacuum system|system]]s
* [[Vapour pressure]]

== Material limitations ==
Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100&amp;nbsp;°C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which [[adsorption|adsorb]] on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon "cycling" the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an "interlock" is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a "puff" of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.

Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: "through-gassing"):
* Majority of [[organic compounds]] cannot be used:
** [[Plastics]], other than [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] and [[Polyether ether ketone|PEEK]]: [[gasket]]s are made of copper, and are single-use; plastics in other uses are replaced with [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] or metals.  Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as [[Viton]]) and perfluoroelastomers (such as [[Kalrez]]) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive.
** [[Glue]]s: special glues for high vacuum must be used.
* Some [[steels]]: due to oxidization of [[carbon steel]], which greatly increases adsorption area, only [[stainless steel]] is used.  Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] grades such as [[304 stainless steel|304]] and [[316 stainless steel|316]] are preferred.  These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel.  Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as [[304L]] and [[316L]]), and grades with additives such as [[niobium]] and [[molybdenum]] to reduce the formation of [[chromium carbide]] (which provides no corrosion resistance).  Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen).  Chromium carbide precipitation at the [[grain boundaries]] can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation.  
* [[Lead]]: Soldering is performed using [[Solder#Lead-free solder|lead-free solder]].
* [[Indium]]: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems.
* [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]]: High vapor pressures during system bake-out.
* Cleaning is very important for UHV.  Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, [[organic solvents]], or [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]].  [[Electropolishing]] is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface.  This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber.

Technical limitations: 
* [[Screws]]: Threads have a high surface area and tend to "trap" gases, and therefore, are avoided.  Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a "virtual leak".  This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vented Screws - AccuGroup|url=https://www.accu.co.uk/en/971-vented-screws|publisher=accu.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Welding]]: Processes such as [[gas metal arc welding]] and [[shielded metal arc welding]] cannot be used, due to the deposition of [[slag|impure material]] and potential introduction of voids or porosity. [[Gas tungsten arc welding]] (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as [[electron beam welding]] or [[laser beam welding]], are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential [[slag]] inclusions (such as [[submerged arc welding]] and [[flux-cored arc welding]]) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.

== Typical uses ==

Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as:
* [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS)
* [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES)
* [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS)
* [[Thermal desorption spectroscopy]] (TPD)
* [[Thin film]] growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), UHV [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), [[atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) and UHV [[pulsed laser deposition]] (PLD)
* [[Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES)
* [[Field emission microscopy]] and [[Field ion microscopy]]
* [[Atom Probe|Atom Probe Tomography]] (APT)

UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period.  At 0.1 mPa (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr), it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.

UHV is also required for:
* [[Particle accelerator]]s The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) 
* [[Gravitational wave detector]]s such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], [[GEO 600]], and [[TAMA 300]]. The [[LIGO]] experimental apparatus is housed in a 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (353,000 cu.ft.) vacuum chamber at 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; mbar) in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravity waves to be sensed. 
* [[Atomic physics]] experiments which use cold atoms, such as [[ion trap]]ping or making [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s
and, while not compulsory, can prove beneficial in applications such as:
* [[Molecular beam epitaxy]], [[Electron beam evaporation|E-beam evaporation]], [[sputtering]] and other deposition techniques.   
* [[Atomic force microscopy]]. High vacuum enables high [[Q factor]]s on the cantilever oscillation.
* [[Scanning tunneling microscopy]]. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and [[semiconductor]] surfaces, e.g. imaging the [[surface reconstruction]] of the unoxidized [[silicon]] surface.
* [[Electron-beam lithography]]

== Achievement ==
Typically, UHV requires:
*High pumping speed &amp;mdash; possibly multiple [[vacuum pump]]s in series and/or parallel
*Minimize surface area in the chamber
*High conductance tubing to pumps &amp;mdash; short and fat, without obstruction
*Use low-[[outgassing]] materials such as certain stainless steels
*Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc.
*[[Electropolishing|Electropolish]] all metal parts after machining or welding
*Use low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked)
*Bake the system to remove water or hydrocarbons [[adsorbed]] to the walls
*Chill chamber walls to [[cryogenic]] temperatures during use
*Avoid all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint &amp;mdash; always use gloves

[[Outgassing]] is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, [[stainless steel]], and [[ceramic]]s) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;°C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce outgassing further.

[[Hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]] are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the [[grain boundaries]] in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.

There is no single [[vacuum pump]] that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. Pumps commonly used to achieve UHV include:
*[[Turbomolecular pump]]s (especially compound and/or [[magnetic bearing]] types)
*[[Ion pump]]s
*[[Titanium sublimation pump]]s
*[[Non-Evaporable Getter|Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps]]
*[[Cryopump]]s

UHV pressures are measured with an [[ion gauge]], either a hot filament or an inverted magnetron type.

Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket. This all-metal seal can maintain pressures down to 100 pPa (~10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; Torr).

== UHV manipulator ==
A '''UHV manipulator''' allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned.  It may provide rotary
motion, linear motion, or a combination of both.  The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes.  To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, two basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling), or a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side.  Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, [[stepping motor]]s, [[piezoelectric motor]]s, and [[pneumatics]].

The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field.  Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the
electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat.  For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.

'''''Unequal crossing over''''' is a type of gene duplication or deletion event that deletes a sequence in one strand and replaces it with a duplication from its sister [[chromatid]] in [[mitosis]] or from its homologous chromosome during [[meiosis]].  It is a type of [[chromosomal crossover]] between homologous sequences that are not paired precisely. Normally genes are responsible for occurrence of crossing over. It exchanges sequences of different links between chromosomes.  Along with [[gene conversion]], it is believed to be the main  driver for the generation of [[gene duplication]]s and is a source of mutation in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution |edition=Second |last1=Graur |first1=Dan |last2=Li |first2=Wen-Hsiung |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0878932666 |url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Molecular_Evolution.html?id=Bf5-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
During [[meiosis]], the duplicated chromosomes ([[chromatids]]) in eukaryotic organisms are attached to each other in the [[centromere]] region and are thus paired. The maternal and paternal chromosomes then align alongside each other.  During this time, recombination can take place via crossing over of sections of the paternal and maternal chromatids and leads to reciprocal recombination or non-reciprocal recombination.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Unequal crossing over requires a measure of similarity between the sequences for misalignment to occur.  The more similarity within the sequences, the more likely unequal crossing over will occur.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  One of the sequences is thus lost and replaced with the duplication of another sequence.

When two sequences are misaligned, unequal crossing over may create a tandem repeat on one chromosome and a deletion on the other.  The rate of unequal crossing over will increase with the number of repeated sequences around the duplication.  This is because these repeated sequences will pair together, allowing for the mismatch in the cross over point to occur.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics |last=Russel |first=Peter J. |date=2002 |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences for the organism==
Unequal crossing over is the process most responsible for creating regional gene duplications in the genome.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  Repeated rounds of unequal crossing over cause the homogenization of the two sequences.  With the increase in the duplicates, unequal crossing over can lead to dosage imbalance in the genome and can be highly deleterious.&lt;ref name=Dan /&gt;&lt;ref name=russell /&gt;

==Evolutionary implications==
In unequal crossing over, there can be large sequence exchanges between the chromosomes.  Compared with gene conversion, which can only transfer a maximum of 1,500 base pairs, unequal crossing over in yeast rDNA genes has been found to transfer about 20,000 base pairs in a single crossover event&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="szostak1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szostak |first1=J. W. |last2=Wu |first2=R. |title=Unequal crossing over in the ribosomal DNA of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''| doi = 10.1038/284426a0 |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=426–430 |date=1980 |issue=5755|bibcode=1980Natur.284..426S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal crossover can be followed by the [[concerted evolution]] of  duplicated sequences.

It has been suggested that longer intron found between two beta-globin genes are a response to deleterious selection from unequal crossing over in the beta-globin genes.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zimmer1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zimmer |first1=E. A. |last2=Martin |first2=S. M. |last3=Beverley |first3=S. M. |last4=Kan |first4=Y. W. |last5=Wilson |first5=A. C. |title=Rapid duplication and loss of genes coding for the alpha chains of hemoglobin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=77 |pages=2158–2162 |date=1980 | pmc=348671 | doi =10.1073/pnas.77.4.2158 |pmid=6929543|bibcode=1980PNAS...77.2158Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Comparisons between alpha-globin, which does not have long introns, and beta-globin genes show that alpha-globin have 50 times higher concerted evolution.

When unequal crossing over creates a [[gene duplication]], the duplicate has 4 [[evolution]]ary fates. This is due to the fact that [[purifying selection]] acting on a duplicated copy is not very strong.  Now that there is a redundant copy, [[neutral mutation]]s can act on the duplicate.  Most commonly the neutral mutations will continue until the duplicate becomes a [[pseudogene]].  If the duplicate copy increases the dosage effect of the gene product, then the duplicate may be retained as a redundant copy.  [[Neofunctionalization]] is also a possibility: the duplicated copy acquires a mutation that gives it a different function than its ancestor.  If both copies acquire mutations, it is possible that a [[subfunctionalization|subfunctional event]] occurs.  This happens when both of the duplicated sequences have a more specialized function than the ancestral copy&lt;ref name=force1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Force |first1=Allan |last2=Lynch |first2=Michael |last3=Pickettb |first3=F. Bryan |last4=Amoresa |first4=Angel |last5=Yana |first5=Yi-lin  |last6=Postlethwaita |first6=John |date=1999 |title=Preservation of Duplicate Genes by Complementary, Degenerative Mutations |journal=Genetics |volume=151 |pages=1531–1545|pmid=10101175 |pmc=1460548 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genome size===
Gene duplications are the main reason for the increase of genome size, and as unequal crossing over is the main mechanism for gene duplication, unequal crossing over contributes to genome size evolution is the most common regional duplication event that increases the size of the genome.

====Junk DNA====
When viewing the genome of a eukaryote, a striking observation is the large amount of tandem, repetitive DNA sequences that make up a large portion of the genome.  For example, over 50% of the ''Dipodmys ordii'' genome is made up of three specific repeats. ''Drosophila virilis'' has three sequences that make up 40% of the genome, and 35% of the ''Absidia glauca'' is repetitive DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="Dan" /&gt;  These short sequences have no selection pressure acting on them and the frequency of the repeats can be changed by unequal crossing over.&lt;ref name="zhang2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=J. |title=Evolution of the human ASPM gene, a major determinant of brain size |journal=Genetics |volume=165 |pages=2063–2070 |date=2003 | pmid = 14704186 |issue=4 |pmc=1462882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vacuum deposition''' is a family of processes used to deposit layers of material atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule on a solid surface. These processes operate at pressures well below [[atmospheric pressure]] (i.e., [[vacuum]]). The deposited layers can range from a thickness of one atom up to millimeters, forming freestanding structures. Multiple layers of different materials can be used, for example to form [[optical coating]]s. The process can be qualified based on the vapor source; [[physical vapor deposition]] uses a liquid or solid source and [[chemical vapor deposition]] uses a chemical vapor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1533/9780857094698.1|chapter=Overview of coating technologies|title=Surface Modification by Solid State Processing|pages=1–24|year=2014|last1=Quintino|first1=Luisa|isbn=9780857094681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The vacuum environment may serve one or more purposes:
* reducing the particle density so that the [[mean free path]] for collision is long
* reducing the particle density of undesirable atoms and molecules (contaminants)
* providing a low pressure plasma environment
* providing a means for controlling gas and vapor composition
* providing a means for mass flow control into the processing chamber.

Condensing particles can be generated in various ways:
* thermal evaporation, [[Evaporation (deposition)]]
* [[sputtering]]
* [[cathodic arc deposition|cathodic arc vaporization]]
* [[laser ablation]]
* decomposition of a chemical vapor precursor, [[chemical vapor deposition]]

In reactive deposition, the depositing material reacts either with a component of the gaseous environment (Ti + N → TiN) or with a co-depositing species (Ti + C → TiC). A plasma environment aids in activating gaseous species (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2N) and in decomposition of chemical vapor precursors (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 4H). The plasma may also be used to provide ions for vaporization by sputtering or for bombardment of the substrate for sputter cleaning and for bombardment of the depositing material to densify the structure and tailor properties ([[ion plating]]).

== Types ==
When the vapor source is a liquid or solid the process is called [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD). When the source is a chemical vapor precursor, the process is called [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). The latter has several variants: ''low-pressure chemical vapor deposition'' (LPCVD), [[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD), and ''plasma-assisted CVD'' (PACVD). Often a combination of PVD and CVD processes are used in the same or connected processing chambers.

== Applications ==
* [[electric current|Electrical conduction]]: [[metallic film]]s, [[Transparent_conducting_film#Transparent_conducting_oxides|transparent conductive oxides]] (TCOs), [[superconducting film]]s &amp; coatings
* [[Semiconductor]] devices: semiconductor films, electrically insulating films
* [[Solar cell]]s.
* Optical films: [[anti-reflective coating]]s, [[filter (optics)|optical filters]]
* Reflective coatings: [[mirror]]s, [[hot mirror]]s
* [[tribology|Tribological]] coating: hard coatings, erosion resistant coatings, solid film lubricants
* [[Energy conservation]] &amp; generation: [[low emissivity]] glass coatings, solar absorbing coatings, mirrors, solar [[thin film]] [[solar cell|photovoltaic cells]], ''smart'' films
* [[Magnetic film]]s: [[magnetic storage|magnetic recording]]
* [[Diffusion barrier]]: [[gas permeation barrier]]s, [[vapor permeation barrier]]s, [[Solid-state physics|solid state]] [[diffusion barrier]]s
* [[Corrosion]] protection:
* [[automotive industry|Automotive]] applications:  lamp reflectors and trim applications
* Vinyl record pressing, manufacture of gold and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum records]]

A thickness of less than one [[micrometre]] is generally called a [[thin film]] while a thickness greater than one micrometre is called a coating.

[[File:The Corryvreckan Whirlpool - geograph-2404815-by-Walter-Baxter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|The [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] whirlpool in Scotland is the third largest whirlpool in the world]]
A '''whirlpool''' is a body of rotating [[water]] produced by the meeting of opposing currents.{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|reason=Is this universally true?|date=August 2018}} The vast majority of whirlpools are not very powerful and very small whirlpools can be easily seen when a bath or a sink is draining. More powerful ones in seas or oceans may be termed '''''maelstroms'''''. ''[[Vortex]]'' is the proper term for any whirlpool that has a [[downdraft]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In oceans, in narrow straits with fast flowing water, whirlpools are normally caused by [[tides]]; there are few stories of large ships ever being sucked into such a maelstrom, although smaller craft are in danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webecoist.com/2009/07/24/10-magnificent-maelstroms-and-destructive-whirlpools 10 Magnificent Maelstroms]. WebEcoist. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller whirlpools also appear at the base of many [[waterfall]]s&lt;ref name="fenh"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Family Encyclopedia of Natural History |editor1-first=Rosalind |editor1-last=Carreck |date=1982 |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |isbn=0-7112-0225-7 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be observed downstream from manmade structures such as [[weir]]s and dams. In the case of powerful waterfalls, like [[Niagara Falls]], these whirlpools can be quite strong.

As navigation is dangerous in this strait only a small slot of time is available for large ships to pass through.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt; Its impressive strength is caused by the world's strongest tide occurring in the same location during the new and full moon. A narrow channel of {{convert|3|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} length connects the outer Saltfjord with its extension, the large [[Skjerstadfjorden|Skjerstadfjord]], causing a colossal tide which in turn produces the Saltstraumen maelstrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Saltstraumen|title=Saltstraumen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Store Norske Leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moskstraumen ===
{{main|Moskstraumen}}
Moskstraumen is an unusual system of whirlpools in the open seas in the [[Lofoten Islands]] off the [[Norway|Norwegian coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1958 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second strongest whirlpool in the world with flow currents reaching speeds as high as {{convert|32|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It finds mention in several books and movies.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt;

The Moskstraumen is formed by the combination of powerful semi-diurnal tides and the unusual shape of the [[seabed]], with a shallow ridge between the [[Moskenesøya]] and [[Værøy]] islands which amplifies and whirls the tidal currents.&lt;ref name="Compton2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWwQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|title=Why Sailors Can't Swim and Other Marvellous Maritime Curiosities|last=Compton|first=Nic|date=28 July 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-9263-4|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional depictions of the Maelstrom by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Cixin Liu]] describe it as a gigantic circular vortex that reaches the bottom of the ocean, when in fact it is a set of currents and crosscurrents with a rate of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;B.

=== Corryvreckan ===
{{main|Corryvreckan}}
[[File:Corryvreckan.jpg|thumb|Corryvreckan whirlpool]]
The Corryvreckan is a narrow [[strait]] between the islands of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]], in [[Argyll and Bute]], on the northern side of the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]], [[Scotland]]. It is the third-largest whirlpool in the world.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012"/&gt; Flood [[tides]] and inflow from the [[Firth of Lorne]] to the west can drive the waters of Corryvreckan to waves of over {{convert|9|metres}}, and the roar of the resulting maelstrom, which reaches speeds of {{convert|18|km/h|abbr=on}}, can be heard {{convert|16|km|mi}} away. Though it was initially classified as non-navigable by the [[British navy]] it was later categorized as "extremely dangerous".&lt;ref name="Doyle2012"/&gt;

A documentary team from Scottish independent producers [[Northlight Productions]] once threw a [[mannequin]] into the Corryvreckan ("the Hag") with a [[Personal flotation device|life jacket]] and depth gauge. The mannequin was swallowed and spat up far down current with a depth gauge reading of {{convert|262|m|ft}} with evidence of being dragged along the bottom for a great distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/680755 |title=Equinox: Lethal Seas}} UK and US co-production by Northlight, "Lethal Seas" UK Channel 4, "Sea Twister!"

=== Other notable maelstroms and whirlpools ===
[[File:Naruto Whirlpools taken 4-21-2008.jpg|thumb|[[Naruto whirlpools]]]]
[[Old Sow whirlpool]] is located between Deer Island, [[New Brunswick]], Canada, and Moose Island, Eastport, [[Maine]], USA. It is given the epithet "pig-like" as it makes a screeching noise when the vortex is at its full fury and reaches speeds of up to {{convert|27.6|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt; The smaller whirlpools around this Old Sow are known as "Piglets.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt;

The [[Naruto whirlpools]] are located in the Naruto Strait near Awaji Island in Japan, which have speeds of {{convert|26|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt;

[[Skookumchuck Narrows]] is a tidal rapids that develops whirlpools, on the [[Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)|Sunshine Coast]], Canada with current speeds exceeding {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt;

[[French Pass]] ({{lang|fr|Te Aumiti}}) is a narrow and treacherous stretch of water that separates D'Urville Island from the north end of the South Island of New Zealand. In 2000 a whirlpool there caught student divers, resulting in fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divenewzealand.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/frenchpass.pdf|format=PDF|last=Smith|first=I R|title=In the matter of an inquest into the deaths of Narelle Taniko te Purei, Ricki Graeme McDonald and Michael David Welsh|date=14 April 2003|publisher=Nelson District Coroner|via=Dive New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a short-lived whirlpool that sucked in a portion of the 1300 acre (~530 hectares) [[Lake Peigneur]] in [[Louisiana, United States]] after a drilling mishap in November 1980. This was not a naturally occurring whirlpool, but a man-made disaster caused by underwater drillers breaking through the roof of a salt mine. The lake then drained into the mine until the mine filled and the water levels equalized but the ten-foot deep lake was now 1,300 feet deep. This mishap resulted in destruction of five houses, loss of nineteen barges and eight tug boats, oil rigs, a mobile home, and most of a botanical garden. The adjacent settlement of Jefferson Island was reduced in area by 10%. A crater 0.5-mile (~1km) across was left behind. Nine of the barges which had sunk floated back.&lt;ref name="Pile2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Pile|title=The Not Terribly Good Book of Heroic Failures: An intrepid selection from the original volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_qS4RW5nw0C&amp;pg=PT146|date=4 October 2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-27734-6|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heggen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Heggen|title=Underground Rivers: From the River Styx to the Rio San Buenaventura, with occasional diversions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zczBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1108|date=16 January 2015|publisher=Richard Heggen|pages=1108–|id=GGKEY:BS7JB1BB957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Recovery&gt;{{cite web|url= http://members.tripod.com/%7Eearthdude1/texaco/texaco.html |title= And away goes the lake down the drain!|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Archive of tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example of a man-made whirlpool that received significant media coverage was in early June 2015, when an intake vortex formed in [[Lake Texoma]], on the Oklahoma–Texas border, near the floodgates of the dam that forms the lake. At the time of the whirlpool's formation, the lake was being drained after reaching its highest level ever. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], which operates the dam and lake, expected that the whirlpool would last until the lake reached normal seasonal levels by late July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/Levels-at-Lake-Texoma-decrease-rare-look-at-intake-vortex-306557501.html |title=Levels at Lake Texoma decrease; rare look at intake vortex |first=Chelsi |last=Smith |publisher=[[KXII]]-TV |location=Sherman, TX |date=8 June 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dangers ==
[[File:'Edgard Poë et ses oeuvres' by Lix and Dargent 5.jpg|thumb|An illustration from Jules Verne's essay "Edgard Poë et ses oeuvres" (''Edgar Poe and his Works'', 1862) drawn by Frederic Lix or Yan' Dargent]]
Powerful whirlpools have killed unlucky seafarers, but their power tends to be exaggerated by laymen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/episode56 MythBusters Episode 56: Killer Whirlpool]. Mythbustersresults.com. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are virtually no stories of large ships ever being sucked into a whirlpool. Tales like those by [[Paul the Deacon]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Jules Verne]] are entirely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Deacon]], ''[[History of the Lombards]]'' (8th century AD); [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841); and [[Jules Verne]], ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, temporary whirlpools caused by major engineering disasters are capable of submerging large ships. A prominent example is the drilling disaster that occurred on November 20, 1980, in [[Lake Peigneur]]. A drilling platform, eleven barges, several trees, and multiple acres of the surrounding terrain were submerged by the resulting whirlpool. Days after the disaster, once the water pressure equalized, nine of the eleven sunken barges popped out of the whirlpool and refloated on the lake's surface.

Apart from Poe and Verne other literary source is of the 1500s, of [[Olaus Magnus]], a Swedish Bishop, who had stated that the maelstrom which was more powerful than ''The Odyssey'' destroyed ships which sank to the bottom of the sea, and even whales were sucked in. [[Pytheas]], the Greek historian, also mentioned that maelstroms swallowed ships and threw them up again.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Charybdis]] in [[Greek mythology]] was later rationalized as a whirlpool, which sucked entire ships into its fold in the narrow coast of [[Sicily]], a disaster faced by navigators.&lt;ref name="Andrews2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Tamra |title=Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513677-7|page=171|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century, [[Paul the Deacon]], who had lived among the Belgii, described [[tidal bore]]s and the maelstrom for a Mediterranean audience unused to such violent tidal surges:&lt;ref name="Deacon2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deacon|first=Paul the |title=History of the Lombards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt3jZ69vJKQC&amp;pg=PA8|date=3 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0558-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Not very far from this shore … toward the western side, on which the ocean main lies open without end, is that very deep whirlpool of waters which we call by its familiar name "the navel of the sea." This is said to suck in the waves and spew them forth again twice every day. … They say there is another whirlpool of this kind between the island of Britain and the province of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and with this fact the coasts of the Seine region and of Aquitaine agree, for they are filled twice a day with such sudden inundations that any one who may by chance be found only a little inward from the shore can hardly get away. I have heard a certain high nobleman of the [[Gaul]]s relating that a number of ships, shattered at first by a tempest, were afterwards devoured by this same [[Charybdis]]. And when one only out of all the men who had been in these ships, still breathing, swam over the waves, while the rest were dying, he came, swept by the force of the receding waters, up to the edge of that most frightful abyss. And when now he beheld yawning before him the deep chaos whose end he could not see, and half dead from very fear, expected to be hurled into it, suddenly in a way that he could not have hoped he was cast upon a certain rock and sat him down.|source=Paul the Deacon, ''History of the Lombards'', i.6}}

Three of the most notable literary references to the Lofoten Maelstrom date from the nineteenth century. The first is the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841). The second is ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870), the famous novel by [[Jules Verne]]. At the end of this novel, [[Captain Nemo]] seems to commit suicide, sending his ''Nautilus'' submarine into the Maelstrom (although in Verne's [[The Mysterious Island|sequel]] Nemo and the Nautilus were seen to have survived). The "Norway maelstrom" is also mentioned in [[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Melville ''Moby-Dick'' [[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 36|Chapter 36]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'Life of [[St Columba]]', the author, [[Adomnan of Iona]]', attributes to the saint miraculous knowledge of a particular bishop who ran into a whirlpool off the coast of Ireland. In Adomnan's narrative, he quotes Columba saying&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Cólman mac Beognai has set sail to come here, and is now in great danger in the surging tides of the whirlpool of Corryvreckan. Sitting in the prow, he lifts up his hands to heaven and blesses the turbulent, terrible seas. Yet the Lord terrifies him in this way, not so that the ship in which he sits should be overwhelmed and wrecked by the waves, but rather to rouse him to pray more fervently that he may sail through the peril and reach us here.}}

== Etymology ==
One of the earliest uses in English of the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] word (''malström'' or ''malstrøm'') was by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841). In turn, the Nordic word is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''maelstrom'', modern spelling ''maalstroom'', from ''malen'' (''to grind'') and ''stroom'' (''stream''), to form the meaning ''grinding current'' or literally "mill-stream", in the sense of milling (grinding) grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
