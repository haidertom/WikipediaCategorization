 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversial book by [[Stephen Wolfram]], published by his own company in 2002. It contains an empirical and systematic study of computational systems such as [[cellular automata]]. Wolfram calls these systems ''simple programs'' and argues that the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] and methods appropriate for the study of simple programs are relevant to other fields of science.

== Contents ==

=== Computation and its implications===
The thesis of ''A New Kind of Science'' (''NKS'') is twofold: that the nature of [[computation]] must be explored experimentally, and that the results of these experiments have great relevance to understanding the [[physical world]]. Since its nascent beginnings in the 1930s, computation has been primarily approached from two traditions: [[engineering]], which seeks to build practical systems using computations; and [[mathematics]], which seeks to prove theorems about computation.  However, as recently as the 1970s, computing has been described as being at the crossroads of mathematical, engineering, and empirical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Peter | last = Wegner | title = Research Paradigms in Computer Science | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Software Engineering | pages = 322–330 | publisher = IEEE Press | year = 1976 | location = San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Denning | first = Peter J. | title = Computing as a Discipline | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–23 | year = 1989| doi = 10.1145/63238.63239|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram introduces a third tradition that seeks to empirically investigate computation for its own sake: He argues that an entirely new method is needed to do so because traditional mathematics fails to meaningfully describe [[complex systems]], and that there is an upper limit to complexity in all systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/emergence/DBergerNKS.pdf The World According to Wolfram]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple programs===
The basic subject of Wolfram's "new kind of science" is the study of simple abstract rules—essentially, elementary [[computer program]]s. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; [[Mobile automaton|mobile automata]]; [[Turing machine]]s in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]; [[combinator]]s; [[tag system]]s; [[register machine]]s; [[Palindromic number|reversal-addition]]. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements:
# Its operation can be completely explained by a simple graphical illustration.
# It can be completely explained in a few sentences of [[human language]].
# It can be implemented in a computer language using just a few lines of code.
# The number of its possible variations is small enough so that all of them can be computed.

Generally, simple programs tend to have a very simple abstract framework. Simple cellular automata, Turing machines, and combinators are examples of such frameworks, while more complex cellular automata do not necessarily qualify as simple programs. It is also possible to invent new frameworks, particularly to capture the operation of natural systems. The remarkable feature of simple programs is that a significant percentage of them are capable of producing great complexity. Simply enumerating all possible variations of almost any class of programs quickly leads one to examples that do unexpected and interesting things.  This leads to the question: if the program is so simple, where does the complexity come from? In a sense, there is not enough room in the program's definition to directly encode all the things the program can do. Therefore, simple programs can be seen as a minimal example of [[emergence]]. A logical deduction from this phenomenon is that if the details of the program's rules have little direct relationship to its behavior, then it is very difficult to directly engineer a simple program to perform a specific behavior. An alternative approach is to try to engineer a simple overall computational framework, and then do a [[brute-force search]] through all of the possible components for the best match.

Simple programs are capable of a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be [[universal computer]]s. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior, [[continuum mechanics|continuum]] behavior, conserved quantities, [[percolation]], [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], and others. They have been used as models of [[traffic]], material fracture, [[crystal growth]], biological growth, and various [[sociology|sociological]], [[geology|geological]], and [[ecology|ecological]] phenomena. Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall [[complexity]]. ''A New Kind of Science'' argues that this is evidence that simple programs are enough to capture the essence of almost any [[complex system]].

===Mapping and mining the computational universe===
In order to study simple rules and their often complex behaviour, Wolfram argues that it is necessary to systematically explore all of these computational systems and document what they do. He further argues that this study should become a new branch of science, like [[physics]] or [[chemistry]].  The basic goal of this field is to understand and characterize the computational universe using experimental methods.

The proposed new branch of scientific exploration admits many different forms of scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute this or that function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.

Another kind of production involves the creation of programs for the analysis of computational systems. In the ''NKS'' framework, these themselves should be simple programs, and subject to the same goals and methodology. An extension of this idea is that the human mind is itself a computational system, and hence providing it with raw data in as effective a way as possible is crucial to research. Wolfram believes that programs and their analysis should be visualized as directly as possible, and exhaustively examined by the thousands or more. Since this new field concerns abstract rules, it can in principle address issues relevant to other fields of science. However, in general Wolfram's idea is that novel ideas and mechanisms can be discovered in the computational universe, where they can be represented in their simplest forms, and then other fields can choose among these discoveries for those they find relevant.

Wolfram has since expressed "A central lesson of ''A New Kind of Science'' is that there’s a lot of incredible richness out there in the computational universe. And one reason that’s important is that it means that there’s a lot of incredible stuff out there for us to 'mine' and harness for our purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2017/05/a-new-kind-of-science-a-15-year-view/|title=A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View—Stephen Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=blog.stephenwolfram.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic abstract science===
While Wolfram advocates simple programs as a scientific discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is that the study of simple programs is the minimal possible form of science,  grounded equally in both [[abstraction]] and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in ''NKS'' is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has much to offer the sciences.

Wolfram argues that the computational realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by understanding the importance of these realities, we can learn to use them in our favor. For instance, instead of [[reverse engineering]] our theories from observation, we can [[enumeration|enumerate]] systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of ''NKS''  is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.

===Philosophical underpinnings===

====Computational irreducibility====
Wolfram argues that one of his achievements is in providing a coherent system of ideas that justifies computation as an organizing [[Philosophy of science|principle of science]]. For instance, he argues that the concept of ''[[computational irreducibility]]'' (that some complex computations are not amenable to short-cuts and cannot be "reduced"), is ultimately the reason why computational models of nature must be considered in addition to traditional [[mathematical models]]. Likewise, his idea of intrinsic randomness generation—that natural systems can generate their own randomness, rather than using chaos theory or stochastic perturbations—implies that computational models do not need to include explicit randomness.

====Principle of computational equivalence====
Based on his experimental results, Wolfram developed the '''principle of computational equivalence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''PCE'''): the principle states that [[systems]] found in the [[natural environment|natural world]] can perform [[computation]]s up to a [[maximum|maximal]] ("universal") level of [[computational power]]. Most systems can attain this level. Systems, in principle, compute the same things as a computer. Computation is therefore simply a question of translating [[Input/output|input and outputs]] from one system to another. Consequently, most systems are computationally equivalent. Proposed examples of such systems are the workings of the human brain and the evolution of weather systems.

The principle can be restated as follows: almost all processes that are not obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. From this principle, Wolfram draws an array of concrete deductions which he argues reinforce his theory. Possibly the most important among these is an explanation as to why we experience [[randomness]] and [[complexity]]: often, the systems we analyze are just as sophisticated as we are. Thus, complexity is not a special quality of systems, like for instance the concept of "heat,"  but simply a label for all systems whose computations are sophisticated. Wolfram argues that understanding this makes possible the "normal science" of the ''NKS'' paradigm.

At the deepest level, Wolfram argues that—like many of the most important scientific ideas—the principle of computational equivalence allows science to be more general by pointing out new ways in which humans are not "special"; that is, it has been claimed that the complexity of human intelligence makes us special, but the Principle asserts otherwise. In a sense, many of Wolfram's ideas are based on understanding the scientific process—including the human mind—as operating within the same universe it studies, rather than being outside it.

===Applications and results===
There are a number of specific results and ideas in the ''NKS'' book, and they can be organized into several themes. One common theme of examples and applications is demonstrating how little complexity it takes to achieve interesting behavior, and how the proper methodology can discover this behavior.

First, there are several cases where the ''NKS'' book introduces what was, during the book's composition, the simplest known system in some class that has a particular characteristic. Some examples include the first primitive recursive function that results in complexity, the smallest universal [[Turing Machine]], and the shortest [[axiom]] for [[propositional calculus]]. In a similar vein, Wolfram also demonstrates many simple programs that exhibit phenomena like [[phase transition]]s, [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]], continuum behavior, and [[thermodynamics]] that are familiar from traditional science. Simple [[computational model]]s of natural systems like [[shell growth]], [[fluid turbulence]], and [[phyllotaxis]] are a final category of applications that fall in this theme.

Another common theme is taking facts about the computational universe as a whole and using them to reason about fields in a [[holistic]] way. For instance, Wolfram discusses how facts about the computational universe inform [[evolutionary theory]], [[SETI]], [[free will]], [[computational complexity theory]], and philosophical fields like [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and even [[postmodernism]].

Wolfram suggests that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution to the existence of free will in a nominally [[deterministic]] universe.  He posits that the computational process in the [[brain]] of the being with free will is actually [[Complexity|complex]] enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility.  Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is no better way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.

The book also contains a vast number of individual results—both experimental and analytic—about what a particular automaton computes, or what its characteristics are, using some methods of analysis.

The book contains a new technical result in describing the [[Turing completeness]] of the [[Rule 110]] cellular automaton. Very small Turing machines can simulate Rule 110, which Wolfram demonstrates using a 2-state 5-symbol [[universal Turing machine]]. Wolfram conjectures that a particular [[Wolfram's 2-state 3-symbol Turing machine|2-state 3-symbol Turing machine]] is universal. In 2007, as part of commemorating the book's fifth anniversary, Wolfram's company offered a $25,000 prize for proof that this Turing machine is universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Research Prize | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/ | accessdate=2011-03-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515032324/http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/| archivedate= 15 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Smith, a computer science student from [[Birmingham]], UK, won the prize later that year by proving Wolfram's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Wolfram 2,3 Turing Machine Is Universal! | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_news.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical Commentary [on Wolfram 2,3 Turing machine universality proof] | url=http://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/solution_technical.html | accessdate=2007-10-24| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NKS Summer School==
Every year, Wolfram and his group of instructors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2009/faculty.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2009: Faculty|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; organize a summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/|title=Wolfram Science Summer School|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2006, these classes were held at [[Brown University]]. In 2007, the summer school began being hosted by the [[University of Vermont]] at Burlington, with the exception of 2009 which was held at the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione of the CNR in [[Pisa, Italy]].  In 2012, the program was held at [[Curry College]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Since 2013, the Wolfram Summer School has been held annually at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. After 14 consecutive summer schools, more than 550 people have participated, some of whom continued developing their 3-week research projects as their Master's or Ph.D theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/2006/participants/letourneau.html|title=Wolfram Science Summer School 2006: Alumni—Paul-Jean Letourneau|work=wolframscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research done in the summer school has resulted in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rowland | title=A natural prime-generating recurrence | year=2008 | volume=11 | issue=08 | journal=Journal of Integer Sequences| arxiv=0710.3217 | bibcode=2008JIntS..11...28R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m624350kj28305u9/|title=Planar Trivalent Network Computation | doi=10.1007/978-3-540-74593-8_13 | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=146–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Palasek , S. | title=Information flow in cellular automata | year=2013 | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=193–202 | journal=Complex Systems | url=http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/22-2-4.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on April 3, 2018, ''A New Kind of Science'' was listed among the 190 books recommended by Bill Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolinsky|first=Jacob|title=190 Books Recommended by Bill Gates|url=https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/04/bill-gates-books/|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific philosophy===
A tenet of ''NKS'' is that the simpler the system, the more likely a version of it will recur in a wide variety of more complicated contexts. Therefore, ''NKS'' argues that systematically exploring the space of simple programs will lead to a base of reusable knowledge. However, many scientists believe that of all possible parameters, only some actually occur in the universe. For instance, of all possible permutations of the symbols making up an equation, most will be essentially meaningless. ''NKS'' has also been criticized for asserting that the behavior of simple systems is somehow representative of all systems.

===Methodology===
A common criticism of ''NKS'' is that it does not follow established [[scientific methodology]]. For instance, ''NKS'' does not establish [[rigorous]] mathematical definitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=David|title=A Reclusive Kind of Science|journal=Computing in Science and Engineering|pages=79–81|date=September 2002|url = http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-wolfram.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it attempt to prove [[theorem]]s; and most formulas and equations are written in [[Mathematica]] rather than standard notation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Mathematician Looks at Wolfram's New Kind of Science|last=Gray|first=Lawrence|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=2003|volume=50|issue=2|pages=200–211|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200302/fea-gray.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, ''NKS'' has also been criticized for being heavily visual, with much information conveyed by pictures that do not have formal meaning.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; It has also been criticized for not using modern research in the field of [[complexity]], particularly the works that have studied complexity from a rigorous mathematical perspective.&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt; And it has been criticized for misrepresenting [[chaos theory]]: "Throughout the book, he equates chaos theory with the phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)."&lt;ref name=Drysdale&gt;{{cite web|last=Drysdale|first=David|title=Review of "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.lurklurk.org/wolfram/review.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
''NKS'' has been criticized for not providing specific results that would be immediately applicable to ongoing scientific research.&lt;ref name=Berry/&gt; There has also been criticism, implicit and explicit, that the study of simple programs has little connection to the physical universe, and hence is of limited value. [[Steven Weinberg]] has pointed out that no real world system has been explained using Wolfram's methods in a satisfactory fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+search+of+a+scientific+revolution%3A+controversial+genius+Stephen...-a0107699603 | work=Science News | title=In search of a scientific revolution: controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward | first=Peter | last=Weiss | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PCE===
The '''Principle of computational equivalence''' has been criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;!-- However, Wolfram's group has described the principle as such, not a law, theorem or formula. [They described it as being vague, unmathematical, and not able to make directly verifiable predictions?] --&gt; It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Moreover, critics such as [[Ray Kurzweil]] have argued that it ignores the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent.&lt;ref name=Kurzweil/&gt; Others suggest it is little more than a rechristening of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt;&lt;!--  However, the Church-Turing thesis imposes an upper limit while Wolfram's PCE suggests the nonexistence of intermediate degrees of computation sending a computational system either to the upper level (universal) or to the lowest degree. [No. The claim is that intermediate degrees are derived from the complete degree, hence equivalent in "sophistication".] --&gt;

===The fundamental theory (''NKS'' Chapter 9)===
Wolfram's speculations of a direction towards a fundamental theory of physics have been criticized as vague and obsolete. [[Scott Aaronson]], Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas Austin, also claims that Wolfram's methods cannot be compatible with both [[special relativity]] and [[Bell's theorem]] violations, and hence cannot explain the observed results of [[Bell test experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|title=Book Review of ''A New Kind of Science''|journal=Quantum Information and Computation|volume=2|issue=5|year=2002|pages=410–423|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/nks.ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aaronson's arguments are either right and apply to the entire scientific field of [[Quantum gravity]] that seeks to find theories unifying relativity and quantum mechanics or they are fundamentally flawed (e.g. under a non-local hidden variable theory of superdeterminism acknowledged by Bell himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = J. S. | year = 1981 | title = Bertlmann's socks and the nature of reality | url = | journal = Journal de Physique | volume = 42 | issue = C2| pages = 41–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and even explored by e.g. physics Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]],&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author='t Hooft, G.|title=Discreteness and Determinism in Superstrings |date=15 Sep 2012|eprint=1207.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt; see also replies to [[Digital physics#Locality|criticism of digital physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Wheeler]], 1990, "Information, physics, quantum: The search for links" in W. Zurek (ed.) ''Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information''. Redwood City, CA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Smolin, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201031 Matrix models as non-local hidden variables theories]", 2002; also published in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-26669-0_10 Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? The Frontiers Collection], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 2005, pp 121-152, {{ISBN|978-3-540-22188-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=April 2017}}

[[Edward Fredkin]] and [[Konrad Zuse]] pioneered the idea of a [[Cellular automaton#CA as models of the fundamental physical reality|computable universe]], the former by writing a line in his book on how the world might be like a cellular automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.usf.edu/~eclark/ANKOS_zuse_fredkin_thesis.html|title=ZUSE-FREDKIN-THESIS|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that ''NKS'' tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe is a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-9.7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] has also charged that his work on [[Turing machine]]-computable [[physics]] was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.&lt;ref name=Schmid&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jurgen|title=Origin of main ideas in Wolfram's book "A New Kind of Science"|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/wolfram.html|publisher=CERN Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 review of ''NKS'', the Nobel laureate and elementary particle physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] wrote, "Wolfram himself is a lapsed elementary particle physicist, and I suppose he can't resist trying to apply his experience with digital computer programs to the laws of nature. This has led him to the view (also considered in a 1981 paper by Richard Feynman) that nature is discrete rather than continuous. He suggests that space consists of a set of isolated points, like cells in a cellular automaton, and that even time flows in discrete steps. Following an idea of Edward Fredkin, he concludes that the universe itself would then be an automaton, like a giant computer. It's possible, but I can't see any motivation for these speculations, except that this is the sort of system that Wolfram and others have become used to in their work on computers. So might a carpenter, looking at the moon, suppose that it is made of wood."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|title=Is the Universe a Computer?|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/15762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel laureate [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has more recently also suggested a cellular automaton-based unifying theory of quantum gravity as an interpretation of superstring theory where the evolution equations are classical, "[b]oth the bosonic string theory and superstring theory can be reformulated in terms of a special basis of states, defined on a [[space-time]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with lattice length &lt;math&gt;2\pi\sqrt{\alpha'.}&lt;/math&gt;"&lt;ref name="'t Hooft, G"/&gt;

===Natural selection===
Wolfram's claim that [[natural selection]] is not the fundamental cause of complexity in biology has led non-scientist journalist Chris Lavers to state that Wolfram does not understand the [[theory of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavers|first=Chris|title=How the cheetah got his spots|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 August 2002|url= https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4473834,00.html|accessdate=28 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Originality===
''NKS'' has been heavily criticized as not being original or important enough to justify its title and claims.

The authoritative manner in which ''NKS'' presents a vast number of examples and arguments has been criticized as leading the reader to believe that each of these ideas was original to Wolfram;&lt;ref name=Drysdale/&gt; in particular, one of the most substantial new technical results presented in the book, that the [[Rule 110|rule 110 cellular automaton]] is [[Turing complete]], was not proven by Wolfram, but by his research assistant, [[Matthew Cook]]. However, the notes section at the end of his book acknowledges many of the discoveries made by these other scientists citing their names together with historical facts, although not in the form of a traditional bibliography section. Additionally, the idea that very simple rules often generate great complexity is already an established idea in science, particularly in [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=Shalizi/&gt;

'''Actuarial notation''' is a shorthand method to allow [[Actuary|actuaries]] to record mathematical formulas that deal with [[Interest|interest rates]] and [[life tables]].

Traditional notation uses a [[halo system]] where symbols are placed as [[superscript]] or [[subscript]] before or after the main letter. Example notation using the halo system can be seen below.

Various proposals have been made to adopt a linear system where all the notation would be on a single line without the use of superscripts or subscripts. Such a method would be useful for computing where representation of the halo system can be extremely difficult. However, a standard linear system has yet to emerge.

==Example notation==

===Interest rates===
&lt;math&gt;\,i&lt;/math&gt; is the annual [[effective interest rate]], which is the "true" rate of interest over ''a year''. Thus if the annual interest rate is 12% then &lt;math&gt;\,i = 0.12&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "i ''upper'' m") is the [[nominal interest rate]] convertible &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times a year, and is numerically equal to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times the effective rate of interest over one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; of a year. For example, &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; is the nominal rate of interest convertible semiannually. If the effective annual rate of interest is 12%, then &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}/2&lt;/math&gt; represents the effective interest rate every six months. Since &lt;math&gt;\,(1.0583)^{2}=1.12&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}/2=0.0583&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}=0.1166&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;sup&gt;"(m)"&lt;/sup&gt; appearing in the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; is not an "[[exponent]]." It merely represents the number of interest conversions, or compounding times, per year. Semi-annual compounding, (or converting interest every six months), is frequently used in valuing [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] (see also [[fixed income securities]]) and similar [[monetary financial liability]] instruments, whereas home [[mortgages]] frequently convert interest monthly. Following the above example again where &lt;math&gt;\,i=0.12&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(12)}=0.1139&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\,\left(1+\frac{0.1139}{12}\right)^{12}=1.12&lt;/math&gt;.

Effective and nominal rates of interest are not the same because interest paid in earlier measurement periods "earns" interest in later measurement periods; this is called [[compound interest]]. That is, nominal rates of interest credit interest to an investor, (alternatively charge, or [[debit]], interest to a debtor), more frequently than do effective rates. The result is more frequent compounding of interest income to the investor, (or interest expense to the debtor), when nominal rates are used.

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[present value]] of 1 to be paid one year from now:
:&lt;math&gt;\,v = {(1+i)}^{-1}\approx 1-i+i^2&lt;/math&gt;
This present value factor, or discount factor, is used to determine the amount of money that must be invested now in order to have a given amount of money in the future. For example, if you need 1 in one year, then the amount of money you should invest now is: &lt;math&gt;\,1 \times v&lt;/math&gt;. If you need 25 in 5 years the amount of money you should invest now is: &lt;math&gt;\,25 \times v^5&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[annual effective discount rate]]:
:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{i}{1+i}\approx i-i^2&lt;/math&gt;
The value of &lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; can also be calculated from the following relationships: &lt;math&gt;\,(1-d) = v = {(1+i)}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
The rate of discount equals the amount of interest earned during a one-year period, divided by the balance of money at the end of that period. By contrast, an annual effective rate of interest is calculated by dividing the amount of interest earned during a one-year period by the balance of money at the beginning of the year. The present value (today) of a payment of 1 that is to be made &lt;math&gt;\,n&lt;/math&gt; years in the future is &lt;math&gt;\,{(1-d)}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is analogous to the formula &lt;math&gt;\,{(1+i)}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; for the future (or accumulated) value &lt;math&gt;\,n&lt;/math&gt; years in the future of an amount of 1 invested today.

&lt;math&gt;\,d^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;, the nominal rate of discount convertible &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; times a year, is analogous to &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;. Discount is converted on an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt;-ly basis.

&lt;math&gt;\,\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[force of interest]], is the limiting value of the nominal rate of interest when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\delta = \lim_{m\to\infty}i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, interest is [[continuously compounded interest|convertible continuously]].

The general relationship between &lt;math&gt;\,i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,(1+i) = \left(1+\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{m} = e^{\delta} = \left(1-\frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{-m} = (1-d)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Their numerical value can be compared as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\, i &gt; i^{(2)} &gt; i^{(3)} &gt; \cdots &gt; \delta &gt; \cdots &gt; d^{(3)} &gt; d^{(2)} &gt; d&lt;/math&gt;

===Life tables===
A [[life table]] (or a mortality table) is a mathematical construction that shows the number of people alive (based on the assumptions used to build the table) at a given age. In addition to the number of lives remaining at each age, a mortality table typically provides various probabilities associated with the development of these values.

&lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of people alive, relative to an original cohort, at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. As age increases the number of people alive decreases.

&lt;math&gt;\,l_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting point for &lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt;: the number of people alive at age 0. This is known as the '''radix''' of the table. Some mortality tables begin at an age greater than 0, in which case the radix is the number of people assumed to be alive at the youngest age in the table.

&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting age of the mortality tables. &lt;math&gt;\,l_n&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all &lt;math&gt;\,n \geq \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of people who die between age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt; may be calculated using the formula &lt;math&gt;\,d_x = l_x - l_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,q_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of death between the ages of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,q_x = d_x / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,p_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,p_x = l_{x+1} / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

Since the only possible alternatives from one age (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) to the next (&lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;) are living and dying, the relationship between these two probabilities is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,p_x+q_x=1&lt;/math&gt;

These symbols may also be extended to multiple years, by inserting the number of years at the bottom left of the basic symbol.

&lt;math&gt;\,_nd_x = d_x + d_{x+1} + \cdots + d_{x+n-1} = l_x - l_{x+n}&lt;/math&gt; shows the number of people who die between age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,_nq_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of death between the ages of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,_nq_x = {}_nd_x / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,_np_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,_np_x = l_{x+n} / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

Another statistic that can be obtained from a life table is [[life expectancy]].

&lt;math&gt;\,e_x&lt;/math&gt; is the curtate expectation of life for a person alive at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This is the expected number of complete years remaining to live (you may think of it as the expected number of birthdays that the person will celebrate).

:&lt;math&gt;\,e_x = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \ _tp_x&lt;/math&gt;

A life table generally shows the number of people alive at integral ages. If we need information regarding a fraction of a year, we must make assumptions with respect to the table, if not already implied by a mathematical formula underlying the table. A common assumption is that of a Uniform Distribution of Deaths (UDD) at each year of age. Under this assumption, &lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear interpolation]] between &lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;. i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+t} = (1 - t)l_x + tl_{x+1} &lt;/math&gt;

===Annuities===
The basic symbol for the present value of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] is &lt;math&gt;\,a&lt;/math&gt;. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the frequency of payment (i.e., the number of annuity payments that will be made during each year). A lack of such notation means that payments are made annually.
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the annuity starts and the period for which an annuity is paid.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates when payments are made. Two dots indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the beginning of each year (an "annuity-due"); a horizontal line above the symbol indicates an annuity payable continuously (a "continuous annuity"); no mark above the basic symbol indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the end of each year (an "annuity-immediate").

If the payments to be made under an annuity are independent of any life event, it is known as an [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)#Annuity certain|annuity-certain]]. Otherwise, in particular if payments end upon the [[beneficiary]]'s death, it is called a [[life annuity]].

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; (read ''a-angle-n at i'') represents the present value of an annuity-immediate, which is a series of unit payments at the end of each year for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years (in other words: the value one period before the first of ''n'' payments). This value is obtained from:

:&lt;math&gt;\,a_{\overline{n|}i} = v + v^2 + \cdots + v^n = \frac{1-v^n}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; represents the present value of an annuity-due, which is a series of unit payments at the beginning of each year for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years (in other words: the value at the time of the first of ''n'' payments). This value is obtained from:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i} = 1 + v + \cdots + v^{n-1} = \frac{1-v^n}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,s_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; is the value at the time of the last payment, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{s}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; the value one period later.

If the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,(m)&lt;/math&gt; is added to the top-right corner, it represents the present value of an annuity whose payments occur each one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;th of a year for a period of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years, and each payment is one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;th of a unit.

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} = \frac{1-v^n}{i^{(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} = \frac{1-v^n}{d^{(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting value of &lt;math&gt;\,a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound. The underlying annuity is known as a [[continuous annuity]].

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i}= \frac{1-v^n}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

The present values of these annuities may be compared as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i} &lt; a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} &lt; \overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i} &lt; \ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt; \ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt;

To understand the relationships shown above, consider that cash flows paid at a later time have a smaller present value than cash flows of the same total amount that are paid at earlier times.

* The subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; which represents the rate of interest may be replaced by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and is often omitted if the rate is clearly known from the context.
* When using these symbols, the rate of interest is not necessarily constant throughout the lifetime of the annuities. However, when the rate varies, the above formulas will no longer be valid; particular formulas can be developed for particular movements of the rate.

===Life annuities===
A life annuity is an annuity whose payments are contingent on the continuing life of the annuitant. The age of the annuitant is an important consideration in calculating the [[actuarial present value]] of an annuity.

* The age of the annuitant is placed at the bottom right of the symbol, without an "angle" mark.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\,a_{65}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the end of each year until death to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{10|}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable for 10 years with payments being made at the end of each year

&lt;math&gt;a_{65:\overline{10|}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year for 10 years, or until death if earlier, to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;a_{65:64}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the earlier death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{65:64}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the later death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64. 

&lt;math&gt;a_{65}^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable 12 times a year (1/12 unit per month) until death to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;{\ddot{a}}_{65}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the start of each year until death to someone currently age 65

or in general:

&lt;math&gt;a_{x:\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the age of the annuitant, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of years of payments (or until death if earlier), &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of payments per year, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the interest rate.

In the interest of simplicity the notation is limited and does not, for example, show whether the annuity is payable to a man or a woman (a fact that would typically be determined from the context, including whether the life table is based on male or female mortality rates).
 
The Actuarial Present Value of life contingent payments can be treated as the mathematical expectation of a present value random variable, or calculated through the current payment form.

===Life insurance===
The basic symbol for a [[life insurance]] is &lt;math&gt;\,A&lt;/math&gt;. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the timing of the payment of a death benefit. A lack of notation means payments are made at the end of the year of death. A figure in parenthesis (for example &lt;math&gt;A^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt;) means the benefit is payable at the end of the period indicated (12 for monthly; 4 for quarterly; 2 for semi-annually; 365 for daily).
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the life insurance begins.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates the "type" of life insurance, whether payable at the end of the period or immediately. A horizontal line indicates life insurance payable immediately, whilst no mark above the symbol indicates payment is to be made at the end of the period indicated.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\,A_x&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the year of death.

&lt;math&gt;\,A_x^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the month of death.

&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the (mathematical) instant of death.

== Force of mortality ==

Among actuaries, '''force of mortality''' refers to what [[economists]] and other social scientists call the [[hazard rate]] and is construed as an instantaneous rate of mortality at a certain age measured on an annualized basis.

In a life table, we consider the probability of a person dying between age (''x'') and age ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; this probability is called ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the continuous case, we could also consider the [[conditional probability]] that a person who has attained age (''x'') will die between age (''x'') and age (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''x'') as:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\Delta x}(x)=P(x&lt;X&lt;x+\Delta\;x\mid\;X&gt;x)=\frac{F_X(x+\Delta\;x)-F_X(x)}{(1-F_X(x))}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the continuous age-at-death [[random variable]], X. As Δ''x'' tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by Δ''x''. If we let Δ''x'' tend to zero, we get the function for '''force of mortality''', denoted as ''μ''(''x''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\,(x)=\frac{F'_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[history of mathematics|historical study of mathematics]], an '''apotome''' is a line segment formed from a longer line segment by breaking it into two parts, one of which is [[Commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] only in power to the whole; the other part is the apotome. In this definition, two line segments are said to be "commensurable only in power" when the ratio of their lengths is an [[irrational number]] but the ratio of their squared lengths is rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Translated into modern algebraic language, an apotome can be interpreted as a [[quadratic irrational]] number formed by subtracting one [[square root]] of a rational number from another.
This concept of the apotome appears in [[Euclid's Elements]] beginning in book X, where Euclid defines two special kinds of apotomes. In an apotome of the first kind, the whole is rational, while in an apotome of the second kind, the part subtracted from it is rational; both kinds of apotomes also satisfy an additional condition.  Euclid Proposition XIII.6 states that, if a rational line segment is split into two pieces in the [[golden ratio]], then both pieces may be represented as apotomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII6.html Euclid Proposition XIII.6].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''C-Thru Ruler Company''' is an [[United States|American]] maker of measuring devices and specialized products for drafting, designing and drawing. The company was formed in 1939 in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sliderulemuseum.com/MiscUSA.htm |title=Overview OEMs Rulers |publisher=sliderulemuseum.com}} Retrieved on December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by Jennie R. Zachs, a schoolteacher, who saw the need for transparent measuring tools such as [[ruler]]s, [[triangle (drawing tool)|triangle]]s, [[curve (drawing tool)|curve]]s and [[protractor]]s.  

During the 1990s, the company expanded into the [[paper craft]]ing and [[scrapbooking]] fields under the Little Yellow Bicycle and Déjà Views brands.

In June 2012, [[Acme United Corporation]] bought the ruler, lettering and drafting portions of C-Thru Ruler. The scrap booking part of the business, continues to be managed by the Zachs family under the Little Yellow Bicycle Inc. name.

==History==

===Jennie Zachs===
Jennie R. Zachs, born in 1898, was the daughter of Benjamin and Julia Zachs who emigrated from [[Russia]] to the [[United States]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/hartfordcourant/obituary.aspx?n=jennie-r-zachs&amp;pid=712998&amp;fhid=4131 |title=Jennie R. Zachs - Obituary |publisher=legacy.com}} Retrieved on December 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from high school in [[Hartford, CT]]. A few years later, she graduated from college and became a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While teaching, she developed the idea that when students would be able to see through their rulers, it would make the tool much more useful in the classroom. As a result, Ms. Zachs started the development of two transparent rulers made out of [[plastic]].

In 1939, she founded C-Thru Ruler Company in Bloomfield, Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/hartfordcourant/obituary.aspx?n=jennie-r-zachs&amp;pid=712998&amp;fhid=4131 |title=Jennie R. Zachs – Obituary |publisher=legacy.com}} Retrieved on December 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and designed a whole family of transparent measuring tools like [[ruler]]s, [[triangle (drawing tool)|triangle]]s, [[curve (drawing tool)|curve]]s and [[protractor]]s. Shortly after, she engaged a supplier to [[Milling machine|mill]] the tools out of plastic sheet and began to attend different [[trade show]]s and conventions for [[blue printer]]s and art materials dealers to sell the products. She noticed that the transparent measuring tools could effectively replace wood and metal measuring devices for many applications in drafting, designing and drawing.

===1940–1969===
Only one year after founding the company, Jennie Zachs took in two [[partner (business)|partner]]s to handle the expansion of C-Thru. Edward Zachs, her brother, joined C-Thru and Anna Zachs, her sister, became an investor.  On October 14, 1946, C-Thru Ruler Company was formally incorporated in Connecticut.

In 1957, Edward’s son, Ted also started working at the Company. The following years, [[sales representative]]s were hired and the products line was significantly expanded through a distribution arrangement with [[Letraset]], a manufacturer of dry transfer, rub on lettering and lettering tapes.

===1970–1989===
In 1970, Letraset decided to start selling its own line of transparent tools. In response thereto, C-Thru [[acquiration|acquire]]d a small manufacturer of dry transfer lettering products and started offering its own line of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] lettering. One year later, Ted Zachs bought out the other family members and became the sole shareholder of C-Thru.

In 1983, Jed Zachs, the son of Ted, joined the business and in 1985 another small acquisition was completed, which expanded the line of [[adhesive]] backed vinyl letters and [[stencil]]s for signage purposes.

===1990–2012===
In 1993, Ross Zachs, Ted Zachs’ younger son also became part of the company. Jed oversaw manufacturing and related operations, while Ross played a key role in the creative and marketing sides of the business.

The following year, C-Thru’s owners saw that scrapbooking was growing rapidly and decided to enter that market with a line of stencils, templates and rulers. In the same year, it also created the Deja Views brand and began to sell to hobby and craft dealers, primarily small independent stores and a few chains, including [[Michaels]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; which only had a handful of stores at that time.

To expand the design and paper crafting business, a new brand called Little Yellow Bicycle was launched in 2008 with a differentiated line for independent retailers.

In June 2012, the non-scrapbooking part of the business was sold to Acme United Corporation. Acme United purchased the [[inventory]], [[Tool management|tooling]], [[brand]]s, and other [[intellectual property]] for approximately $1.47 million. In 2011, revenues for the C-Thru Ruler part of the business reached about $2.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120607006469/en/Acme-United-Corporation-Acquires-Assets-C-Thru-Ruler |title=Acme United Corporation Acquires Assets of the C-Thru Ruler Company |publisher=businesswire.com}} Retrieved on December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zachs family continued to focus on the design and paper crafting business under the Little Yellow Bicycle Inc. name with Ted Zachs as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littleyellowbicycle.typepad.com/my-blog/2012/06/an-announcement-from-little-yellow-bicycle.html |title=The C-Thru Ruler Company Sells Ruler, Lettering, and Drafting Business |publisher=littleyellowbicycle.typepad.com}} Retrieved on December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==C-Thru Ruler as Acme United Brand==
After the acquisition, the C-Thru products were gradually integrated into Acme United’s Westcott product family, which mainly consists of rulers, scissors and other school and office products. So, the identity of C-Thru in most cases has become Westcott.

[[Vector algebra]] and [[geometric algebra]] are complementary approaches to providing additional algebraic structures on vector spaces, with geometric interpretations, particularly [[vector field]]s in [[multivariable calculus]] and applications in [[mathematical physics]].

Vector algebra is specific to Euclidean 3-space, while geometric algebra uses [[multilinear algebra]] and applies in all dimensions and signatures, notably 3+1 [[spacetime]] as well as 2 dimensions. They are mathematically equivalent in 3 dimensions, where this article is focused, though the approaches differ. Vector algebra is more widely used in elementary multivariable calculus, while geometric algebra is used in more advanced treatments, and is proposed for elementary use as well.

== Basic concepts and operations ==
Geometric algebra (GA) is an extension or completion of vector algebra (VA).{{sfn|Vold|1993|p=1}} The reader is herein assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts and operations of VA and this article will mainly concern itself with operations in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal G_{3}&lt;/math&gt; the GA of 3D space (nor is this article intended to be mathematically rigorous). In GA, vectors are not normally written boldface as the meaning is usually clear from the context.

The fundamental difference is that GA provides an additional product of vectors called the "geometric product". Elements of GA are graded [[multivector]]s, scalars are grade 0, the usual vectors are grade 1, bivectors are grade 2 and the highest grade (3 in the 3D case) is traditionally called the pseudoscalar and designated &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The ungeneralized 3D vector form of the geometric product is {{sfn|Gull|Lasenby|Doran|1993|p=6}}:

:&lt;math&gt;ab=a \cdot b + a \wedge b &lt;/math&gt;

that is the sum of the usual dot (inner) product and the outer (exterior) product (this last is closely related to the cross product and will be explained below).

In VA, entities such as [[pseudovector]]s  and [[pseudoscalar]]s need to be bolted on, whereas in GA the equivalent bivector and pseudovector respectively exist naturally as subspaces of the algebra.

For example, applying vector calculus in 2 dimensions, such as to compute torque or curl, requires adding an artificial 3rd dimension and extending the vector field to be constant in that dimension, or alternately considering these to be scalars. The torque or curl is then a normal vector field in this 3rd dimension. By contrast, geometric algebra in 2 dimensions defines these as a pseudoscalar field (a bivector), without requiring a 3rd dimension. Similarly, the [[scalar triple product]] is ad hoc, and can instead be expressed uniformly using the exterior product and the geometric product.

== Translations between formalisms ==

Here are some comparisons between standard &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; vector relations and their corresponding [[exterior product]] and geometric product equivalents.  All the exterior and geometric product equivalents here are good for more than three dimensions, and some also for two.  In two dimensions the cross product is undefined even if what it describes (like torque) is perfectly well defined in a plane without introducing an arbitrary normal vector outside of the space.

Many of these relationships only require the introduction of the exterior product to generalize, but since that may not be familiar to somebody with only a background in vector algebra and calculus, some examples are given.

=== Cross and exterior products ===
[[File:Exterior calc cross product.svg|right|thumb|The cross product in relation to the exterior product. In red are the orthogonal [[unit vector]], and the "parallel" unit bivector.]]
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \times \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to the plane containing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; is an oriented representation of the same plane.

We have the pseudoscalar &lt;math&gt;I = e_{1}e_{2}e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; (right handed orthonormal frame) and so

: &lt;math&gt;e_{1}I = Ie_{1}=  e_{2}e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; returns a bivector and

: &lt;math&gt;I (e_{2} \wedge e_{3}) = Ie_2e_3 = -e_1&lt;/math&gt; returns a vector perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;e_{2} \wedge e_{3}&lt;/math&gt; plane.

This yields a convenient definition for the [[cross product]] of traditional vector algebra:

:&lt;math&gt;{u}\times{v} = -I({u}\wedge{v})&lt;/math&gt;

(this is antisymmetric). Relevant is the distinction between axial and polar vectors in vector algebra, which is natural in geometric algebra as the distinction between vectors and bivectors (elements of grade two).

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; here is a unit [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space, which establishes a duality between the vectors and the bivectors, and is named so because of the expected property

:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = (e_1 e_2 e_3)^2 
=  e_1 e_2 e_3 e_1 e_2 e_3
= - e_1 e_2 e_1 e_3 e_2 e_3
=  e_1 e_1 e_2 e_3 e_2 e_3
= - e_3 e_2 e_2 e_3
= -1&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; cross product and the exterior product expression above can be confirmed by direct multiplication of &lt;math&gt;-i = - {e_1} {e_2} {e_3}&lt;/math&gt; with a determinant expansion of the exterior product

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i} \wedge {e_j}
= \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i}  {e_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Cross product#Cross product as an exterior product|Cross product as an exterior product]].  Essentially, the geometric product of a bivector and the [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space provides a method of calculation of the [[Hodge dual]].

=== Norm of a vector ===

Ordinarily:

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;

Making use of the geometric product and the fact that the exterior product of a vector wedge with itself is zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf u \, \mathbf u = {\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 = {\mathbf u}^2 = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u + \mathbf u \wedge \mathbf u = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;

=== Lagrange identity ===

In three dimensions the product of two vector lengths can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross products

:&lt;math&gt;
{\Vert \mathbf{u} \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
=
({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}})^2 + {\Vert \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding generalization expressed using the geometric product is

:&lt;math&gt;
{\Vert \mathbf{u} \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf{v} \Vert}^2
= ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}})^2 - (\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v})^2
&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from expanding the geometric product of a pair of vectors with its reverse

:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{u} \mathbf{v})(\mathbf{v} \mathbf{u}) 
= ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} + {\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}}) ({\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}} - {\mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v}})
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Determinant expansion of cross and wedge products ===

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf u \times \mathbf v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}  {\mathbf e}_i \times {\mathbf e}_j }
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}  {\mathbf e}_i \wedge {\mathbf e}_j }
&lt;/math&gt;

Linear algebra texts will often use the determinant for the solution of linear systems by [[Cramer's rule]] or for and matrix inversion.

An alternative treatment is to axiomatically introduce the wedge product, and then demonstrate that this can be used directly to solve linear systems.  This is shown below, and does not require sophisticated math skills to understand.

It is then possible to define determinants as nothing more than the coefficients of the wedge product in terms of "unit ''k''-vectors" (&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf e}_i \wedge {\mathbf e}_j&lt;/math&gt; terms) expansions as above.

:A one-by-one determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^1&lt;/math&gt; 1-vector.
:A two-by-two determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt; bivector
:A three-by-three determinant is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; trivector
:...

When linear system solution is introduced via the wedge product, Cramer's rule follows as a side-effect, and there is no need to lead up to the end results with definitions of minors, matrices, matrix invertibility, adjoints, cofactors, Laplace expansions, theorems on determinant multiplication and row column exchanges, and so forth.

=== Matrix Related===

Matrix inversion (Cramer's rule) and determinants can be naturally expressed in terms of the wedge product.

The use of the wedge product in the solution of linear equations can be quite useful for various geometric product calculations.

Traditionally, instead of using the wedge product, Cramer's rule is usually presented as a generic algorithm that can be used to solve linear equations of the form &lt;math&gt; A  x =  b&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently to invert a matrix).  Namely

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{|A|}\operatorname{adj}( A) b .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a useful theoretic result.  For numerical problems row reduction with pivots and other methods are more stable and efficient.

When the wedge product is coupled with the Clifford product and put into a natural geometric context, the fact that the determinants are used in the expression of &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^N&lt;/math&gt; parallelogram area and parallelepiped volumes (and higher-dimensional generalizations thereof) also comes as a nice side-effect.

As is also shown below, results such as Cramer's rule also follow directly from the wedge product's selection of non-identical elements.  The end result is then simple enough that it could be derived easily if required instead of having to remember or look up a rule.

Two variables example
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = a x + b y = c .&lt;/math&gt;

Pre- and post-multiplying by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;      (  a x +  b y ) \wedge  b = ( a \wedge  b) x =        c \wedge  b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a \wedge (  a x +  b y )       = ( a \wedge  b) y =  a \wedge  c      &lt;/math&gt;

Provided &lt;math&gt; a \wedge  b \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{ a \wedge  b} \begin{bmatrix} c \wedge  b \\  a \wedge  c\end{bmatrix} .&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt; a,  b \in {\mathbb R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, this is Cramer's rule since the &lt;math&gt;{e}_1 \wedge {e}_2&lt;/math&gt; factors of the wedge products

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \begin{vmatrix}u_1 &amp; u_2 \\ v_1 &amp; v_2 \end{vmatrix} {e}_1 \wedge {e}_2&lt;/math&gt;

divide out.

Similarly, for three, or ''N'' variables, the same ideas hold

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} a &amp;  b &amp; c \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = d &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{ a \wedge  b \wedge  c}
\begin{bmatrix}
 d \wedge  b \wedge  c \\
 a \wedge  d \wedge  c \\
 a \wedge  b \wedge  d
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, for the three variable three equation case this is Cramer's rule since the &lt;math&gt;{e}_1 \wedge {e}_2 \wedge {e}_3&lt;/math&gt; factors of all the wedge products divide out, leaving the familiar determinants.

A numeric example with three equations and two unknowns:
In case there are more equations than variables and the equations have a solution, then each of the k-vector quotients will be scalars.

To illustrate here is the solution of a simple example with three equations and two unknowns.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
x + 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The right wedge product with &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt; solves for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
x = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and a left wedge product with &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 0)&lt;/math&gt; solves for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
y = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that both of these equations have the same factor, so
one can compute this only once (if this was zero it would
indicate the system of equations has no solution).

Collection of results for
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; yields a Cramer's rule-like form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{(1, 1, 0) \wedge (1, 1, 1)}
\begin{bmatrix}
(1, 1, 2) \wedge (1, 1, 1) \\
(1, 1, 0) \wedge (1, 1, 2)
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Writing &lt;math&gt;{e} _i \wedge {e} _j = {e} _{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, we have the end result:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
=
\frac{1}{{e}_{13} + {e}_{23}}
\begin{bmatrix}
{-{e}_{13} - {e}_{23}} \\
{2{e}_{13} +2{e}_{23}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Equation of a plane ===
For the plane of all points &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; through the plane passing through three independent points &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_2&lt;/math&gt;, the normal form of the equation is

:&lt;math&gt;(({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_0) \times ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_0)) \cdot ({\mathbf r} - {\mathbf r}_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent wedge product equation is
:&lt;math&gt;({\mathbf r}_2 - {\mathbf r}_0) \wedge ({\mathbf r}_1 - {\mathbf r}_0) \wedge ({\mathbf r} - {\mathbf r}_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Projection and rejection ===

Using the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] a single vector can be decomposed into two components with respect to a reference vector, namely the projection onto a unit vector in a reference direction, and the difference between the vector and that projection.

With, &lt;math&gt;  \hat{u} =  u / {\Vert  u \Vert}&lt;/math&gt;, the projection of &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;  \hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Proj}_{{\hat{u}}}\,{v} =  \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v)&lt;/math&gt;

Orthogonal to that vector is the difference, designated the rejection,

:&lt;math&gt;  v -  \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v) = \frac{1}{{\Vert  u \Vert}^2} ( {\Vert  u \Vert}^2  v -  u ( u \cdot  v))&lt;/math&gt;

The rejection can be expressed as a single geometric algebraic product in a few different ways

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{  u }{{ u}^2} (  u  v -  u \cdot  v)
= \frac{1}{ u} (  u \wedge  v )
=  \hat{u} (  \hat{u} \wedge  v )
= (  v \wedge  \hat{u} )  \hat{u} 
&lt;/math&gt;

The similarity in form between the projection and the rejection is notable. The sum of these recovers the original vector

:&lt;math&gt; v = \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v) + \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \wedge v ) &lt;/math&gt;

Here the projection is in its customary vector form.  An alternate formulation is possible that puts the projection in a form that differs from the usual vector formulation

:&lt;math&gt;  v
=  \frac{1}{ u} ( {u} \cdot  v) + \frac{1}{ u} (  {u} \wedge  v )
=  ( {v} \cdot  u) \frac{1}{ u}  + (  v \wedge  u ) \frac{1}{ u} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Working backwards from the end result, it can be observed that this orthogonal decomposition result can in fact follow more directly from the definition of the geometric product itself.

:&lt;math&gt; v =  \hat{u} \hat{u} v = \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot  v +  \hat{u} \wedge  v )
&lt;/math&gt;

With this approach, the original geometrical consideration is not necessarily obvious, but it is a much quicker way to get at the same algebraic result.

However, the hint that one can work backwards, coupled with the knowledge that the wedge product can be used to solve sets of linear equations (see: [http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/bookpdf/TheExteriorProduct.pdf] ), the problem of orthogonal decomposition can be posed directly,

Let &lt;math&gt; v = a  u +  x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u \cdot  x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  To discard the portions of &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt; that are colinear with &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, take the exterior product

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v =  u \wedge (a  u +  x) =  u \wedge  x&lt;/math&gt;

Here the geometric product can be employed

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v =  u \wedge  x =  u  x -  u \cdot  x =  u  x&lt;/math&gt;

Because the geometric product is invertible, this can be solved for ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{u}( u \wedge v ) .&lt;/math&gt;

The same techniques can be applied to similar problems, such as calculation of the component of a vector in a plane and perpendicular to the plane.

For three dimensions the projective and rejective components of a vector with respect to an arbitrary non-zero unit vector, can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross product

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \hat{\mathbf u})\hat{\mathbf u} + \hat{\mathbf u} \times (\mathbf v \times \hat{\mathbf u}) .&lt;/math&gt;

For the general case the same result can be written in terms of the dot and wedge product and the geometric product of that and the unit vector

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \hat{\mathbf u})\hat{\mathbf u} + (\mathbf v \wedge \hat{\mathbf u}) \hat{\mathbf u}. &lt;/math&gt;

It's also worthwhile to point out that this result can also be expressed using right or left vector division as defined by the geometric product:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = (\mathbf v \cdot \mathbf u)\frac{1}{\mathbf u} + (\mathbf v \wedge \mathbf u) \frac{1}{\mathbf u}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \frac{1}{\mathbf u}(\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v) + \frac{1}{\mathbf u}(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v) .&lt;/math&gt;

Like vector projection and rejection, higher-dimensional analogs of that calculation are also possible using the geometric product.

As an example, one can calculate the component of a vector perpendicular to a plane and the projection of that vector onto the plane.

Let &lt;math&gt; w = a u + b v + x &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; u \cdot  x =  v \cdot  x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  As above, to discard the portions of &lt;math&gt; w&lt;/math&gt; that are colinear with &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;, take the wedge product

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge u \wedge v = (a u + b v + x) \wedge u \wedge v = x \wedge u \wedge v .&lt;/math&gt;

Having done this calculation with a vector projection, one can guess that this quantity equals &lt;math&gt; x ( u \wedge v )&lt;/math&gt;. One can also guess there is a vector and bivector dot product like quantity such that the allows the calculation of the component of a vector that is in the "direction of a plane".  Both of these guesses are correct, and validating these facts is worthwhile. However, skipping ahead slightly, this to-be-proven fact allows for a nice closed form solution of the vector component outside of the plane:

:&lt;math&gt; x
= ( w \wedge u \wedge v)\frac{1}{ u \wedge v}
= \frac{1}{ u \wedge v}( u \wedge v \wedge w).
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the similarities between this planar rejection result and the vector rejection result. To calculate the component of a vector outside of a plane we take the volume spanned by three vectors (trivector) and "divide out" the plane.

Independent of any use of the geometric product it can be shown that this rejection in terms of the standard basis is

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ { e}_i &amp; { e}_j &amp; { e}_k \\ \end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;(A_{u,v})^2
= \sum_{i&lt;j} \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}
= -( u \wedge  v)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

The (squared) magnitude of &lt;math&gt; x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;{\Vert  x \Vert}^2 =
 x \cdot  w =
\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the (squared) volume of the parallelopiped (base area times perpendicular height) is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Note the similarity in form to the ''w'', ''u'', ''v'' trivector itself

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}} {e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k ,&lt;/math&gt;

which, if you take the set of &lt;math&gt;{e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k&lt;/math&gt; as a basis for the trivector space, suggests this is the natural way to define the length of a trivector.  Loosely speaking the length of a vector is a length, length of a bivector is area, and the length of a trivector is volume.

If a vector is factored directly into projective and rejective terms using the geometric product &lt;math&gt; v = \frac{1}{u}( u \cdot v +  u \wedge v)&lt;/math&gt;, then it is not necessarily obvious that the rejection term, a product of vector and bivector is even a vector.  Expansion of the vector bivector product in terms of the standard basis vectors has the following form

:Let &lt;math&gt;
 r
= \frac{1}{ u} ( u \wedge  v )
= \frac{ u}{ u^2} (  u \wedge  v ) 
= \frac{1}{{\Vert  u \Vert}^2}  u (  u \wedge  v ) 
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
 r = \frac{1}{{\Vert{ u}\Vert}^2} \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\  e_i &amp;  e_j\end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(a result that can be shown more easily straight from &lt;math&gt; r = v - \hat{u} ( \hat{u} \cdot v)&lt;/math&gt;).

The rejective term is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\ u_i &amp; u_j\end{vmatrix} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; r \cdot u = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The magnitude of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert r \Vert}^2 =  r \cdot  v = \frac{1}{{\Vert{u}\Vert}^2} \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

So, the quantity

:&lt;math&gt; {\Vert  r \Vert}^2 {\Vert{ u}\Vert}^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is the squared area of the parallelogram formed by &lt;math&gt; u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also noteworthy that the bivector can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v = \sum_{i&lt;j}{ \begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix} e_i \wedge  e_j } .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus is it natural, if one considers each term &lt;math&gt; e_i \wedge  e_j&lt;/math&gt; as a basis vector of the bivector space, to define the (squared) "length" of that bivector as the (squared) area.

Going back to the geometric product expression for the length of the rejection &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{u} ( u \wedge v )&lt;/math&gt; we see that the length of the quotient, a vector, is in this case is the "length" of the bivector divided by the length of the divisor.

This may not be a general result for the length of the product of two '''''k''-vectors''', however it is a result that may help build some intuition about the significance of the algebraic operations.  Namely,

:When a vector is divided out of the plane (parallelogram span) formed from it and another vector, what remains is the perpendicular component of the remaining vector, and its length is the planar area divided by the length of the vector that was divided out.

=== Area of the parallelogram defined by u and v ===

If A is the area of the parallelogram defined by '''u''' and '''v''', then 
:&lt;math&gt; A^2 = {\Vert \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \Vert}^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}}^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;A^2 = -(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v)^2 = \sum_{i&lt;j}{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j\\v_i &amp; v_j\end{vmatrix}}^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this squared bivector is a geometric multiplication; this computation can alternatively be stated as the [[Gram determinant]] of the two vectors.

=== Angle between two vectors ===

:&lt;math&gt;({\sin \theta})^2 = \frac{{\Vert \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \Vert}^2}{{\Vert \mathbf u \Vert}^2 {\Vert \mathbf v \Vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;({\sin \theta})^2 = -\frac{(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v)^2}{{ \mathbf u }^2 { \mathbf v }^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Volume of the parallelopiped formed by three vectors ===
In vector algebra, the volume of a parallelopiped is given by the square root of the squared norm of the [[scalar triple product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;V^2 = {\Vert (\mathbf u \times \mathbf v) \cdot \mathbf w \Vert}^2
= {\begin{vmatrix}
u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \\ 
v_1 &amp; v_2 &amp; v_3 \\ 
w_1 &amp; w_2 &amp; w_3 \\ 
\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V^2 = -(\mathbf u \wedge \mathbf v \wedge \mathbf w)^2
= -\left(\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
\begin{vmatrix}
u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\ 
v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ 
w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ 
\end{vmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf e}_i \wedge
\hat{\mathbf e}_j \wedge
\hat{\mathbf e}_k 
\right)^2

= \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}
u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\ 
v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\ 
w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ 
\end{vmatrix}}^2
&lt;/math&gt;

====Product of a vector and a bivector====
In order to justify the normal to a plane result above, a general examination of the product of a vector and bivector is required.  Namely,

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v )
= \sum_{i,j&lt;k}w_i {e}_i {\begin{vmatrix}u_j &amp; u_k \\ v_j &amp; v_k \\ \end{vmatrix}} {e}_j \wedge {e}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

This has two parts, the vector part where &lt;math&gt;i=j&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;i=k&lt;/math&gt;, and the trivector parts where no indexes equal.  After some index summation trickery, and grouping terms and so forth, this is

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v) = 
\sum_{i&lt;j}(w_i { e}_j 
- w_j {e}_i )
{\begin{vmatrix}u_i &amp; u_j \\v_i &amp; v_j \\\end{vmatrix}}
+
\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}
{\begin{vmatrix}w_i &amp; w_j &amp; w_k \\ u_i &amp; u_j &amp; u_k \\v_i &amp; v_j &amp; v_k \\\end{vmatrix}} 
{e}_i \wedge {e}_j \wedge {e}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

The trivector term is &lt;math&gt; w \wedge  u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;.  Expansion of &lt;math&gt;( u \wedge v) w&lt;/math&gt; yields the same trivector term (it is the completely symmetric part), and the vector term is negated.  Like the geometric product of two vectors, this geometric product can be grouped into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, one of which is a pure k-vector.  In analogy the antisymmetric part of this product can be called a generalized dot product, and is roughly speaking the dot product of a "plane" (bivector), and a vector.

The properties of this generalized dot product remain to be explored, but first here is a summary of the notation

:&lt;math&gt; w ( u \wedge v) =  w \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  w \wedge u \wedge v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;( u \wedge v)  w = -  w \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  w \wedge u \wedge v &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w \wedge u \wedge v = \frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \wedge v  ) + ( u \wedge v ) w) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; w \cdot ( u \wedge v) = \frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \wedge v ) - ( u \wedge v ) w)
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; w =  x + y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x = a u + b  v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; y \cdot u = y \cdot v = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressing &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt; u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;, products in terms of these components is

:&lt;math&gt;  w ( u \wedge v ) =  x ( u \wedge v ) +  y ( u \wedge v ) =  x \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  y \cdot ( u \wedge  v) +  y \wedge  u \wedge  v&lt;/math&gt;

With the conditions and definitions above, and some manipulation, it can be shown that the term &lt;math&gt; y \cdot ( u \wedge  v) =  0&lt;/math&gt;, which then justifies the previous solution of the normal to a plane problem.  Since the vector term of the vector bivector product the name dot product is zero
when the vector is perpendicular to the plane (bivector), and this vector, bivector "dot product" selects only the components that are in the plane, so in analogy to the vector-vector dot product this name itself is justified by more than the fact this is the non-wedge product term of the geometric vector-bivector product.

=== Derivative of a unit vector ===

It can be shown that a unit vector derivative can be expressed using the cross product

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\mathbf r}{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}\right)
= \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}^3}\left(\mathbf r \times \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right) \times \mathbf r
= \left(\hat{\mathbf r} \times \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}} \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right) \times \hat{\mathbf r}
&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent geometric product generalization is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\mathbf r}{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}\right)
= \frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}^3}\mathbf r \left(\mathbf r \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right)
= \frac{1}{{ \mathbf r }}\left(\hat{\mathbf r} \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus this derivative is the component of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}}\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, this is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{\Vert \mathbf r \Vert}}\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; minus the projection of that vector onto &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt;.

This intuitively makes sense (but a picture would help) since a unit vector is constrained to circular motion, and any change to a unit vector due to a change in its generating vector has to be in the direction of the rejection of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf r}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  That rejection has to be scaled by 1/|r| to get the final result.

When the objective isn't comparing to the cross product, it's also notable that this unit vector derivative can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
{{ \mathbf r }} \frac{d \hat{\mathbf r}}{dt}
= \hat{\mathbf r} \wedge \frac{d \mathbf r}{dt}
&lt;/math&gt;

Symbolically, a complete set of invariants is a collection of maps such that
:&lt;math&gt;\prod f_i : (X/\sim) \to \prod Y_i&lt;/math&gt;
is [[injective]].

As invariants are, by definition, equal on equivalent objects, equality of invariants is a ''necessary'' condition for equivalence; a ''complete'' set of invariants is a set such that equality of these is ''sufficient'' for equivalence. In the context of a group action, this may be stated as: invariants are functions of [[coinvariant]]s (equivalence classes, orbits), and a complete set of invariants characterizes the coinvariants (is a set of defining equations for the coinvariants).

==Examples==
* In the [[classification of two-dimensional closed manifolds]], [[Euler characteristic]] (or [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]]) and [[orientability]] are a complete set of invariants.
* [[Jordan normal form]] of a matrix is a complete invariant for matrices up to conjugation, but [[eigenvalue]]s (with multiplicities) are not.

==Realizability of invariants==
A complete set of invariants does not immediately yield a [[classification theorem]]: not all combinations of invariants may be realized. Symbolically, one must also determine the image of
:&lt;math&gt;\prod f_i : X \to \prod Y_i.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''connectedness'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/connectedness|title=the definition of connectedness|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to refer to various properties meaning, in some sense, "all one piece". When a mathematical object has such a property, we say it is '''connected'''; otherwise it is '''disconnected'''. When a disconnected object can be split naturally into connected pieces, each piece is usually called a ''component'' (or ''connected component'').

==Connectedness in topology==
{{Main article|Connected space}}

A [[topological space]] is said to be ''[[connected space|connected]]'' if it is not the union of two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] nonempty [[open set]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Topology|last=Munkres|first=James|publisher=Pearson|year=2000|isbn=978-0131816299|location=|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is open if it contains no point lying on its [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]; thus, in an informal, intuitive sense, the fact that a space can be partitioned into disjoint open sets suggests that the boundary between the two sets is not part of the space, and thus splits it into two separate pieces.

==Other notions of connectedness==
Fields of mathematics are typically concerned with special kinds of objects. Often such an object is said to be ''connected'' if, when it is considered as a topological space, it is a connected space. Thus, [[manifold]]s, [[Lie group]]s, and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are all called ''connected'' if they are connected as topological spaces, and their components are the topological components. Sometimes it is convenient to restate the definition of connectedness in such fields. For example, a graph is said to be ''[[connected graph|connected]]'' if each pair of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] in the graph is joined by a [[path (graph theory)|path]]. This definition is equivalent to the topological one, as applied to graphs, but it is easier to deal with in the context of [[graph theory]]. Graph theory also offers a context-free measure of connectedness, called the [[clustering coefficient]].

Other fields of mathematics are concerned with objects that are rarely considered as topological spaces. Nonetheless, definitions of ''connectedness'' often reflect the topological meaning in some way. For example, in [[category theory]], a [[category (mathematics)|category]] is said to be ''[[connected category|connected]]'' if each pair of objects in it is joined by a sequence of [[morphism]]s. Thus, a category is connected if it is, intuitively, all one piece.

There may be different notions of ''connectedness'' that are intuitively similar, but different as formally defined concepts. We might wish to call a topological space ''connected'' if each pair of points in it is joined by a [[path (topology)|path]]. However this condition turns out to be stronger than standard topological connectedness; in particular, there are connected topological spaces for which this property does not hold. Because of this, different terminology is used; spaces with this property are said to be ''[[path connected]]''. While not all connected spaces are path connected, all path connected spaces are connected.

Terms involving ''connected'' are also used for properties that are related to, but clearly different from, connectedness. For example, a path-connected topological space is ''[[simply connected space|simply connected]]'' if each loop (path from a point to itself) in it is [[contractible]]; that is, intuitively, if there is essentially only one way to get from any point to any other point. Thus, a [[sphere]] and a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] are each simply connected, while a [[torus]] is not. As another example, a [[directed graph]] is ''[[strongly connected component|strongly connected]]'' if each [[ordered pair]] of vertices is joined by a [[directed path]] (that is, one that "follows the arrows").

Other concepts express the way in which an object is ''not'' connected. For example, a topological space is ''[[totally disconnected]]'' if each of its components is a single point.

==Connectivity==
{{Main article|Connectivity (graph theory)}}
Properties and parameters based on the idea of connectedness often involve the word ''connectivity''. For example, in [[graph theory]], a [[connected graph]] is one from which we must remove at least one vertex to create a disconnected graph&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graph Theory and Applications|last=Bondy|first=J.A.|last2=Murty|first2=U.S.R.|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishing Co.|year=1976|isbn=0444194517|location=New York, NY|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In recognition of this, such graphs are also said to be ''1-connected''. Similarly, a graph is ''2-connected'' if we must remove at least two vertices from it, to create a disconnected graph. A ''3-connected'' graph requires the removal of at least three vertices, and so on. The ''[[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]]'' of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed, to disconnect it. Equivalently, the connectivity of a graph is the greatest integer ''k'' for which the graph is ''k''-connected.

While terminology varies, [[noun]] forms of connectedness-related properties often include the term ''connectivity''. Thus, when discussing simply connected topological spaces, it is far more common to speak of ''simple connectivity'' than ''simple connectedness''. On the other hand, in fields without a formally defined notion of ''connectivity'', the word may be used as a synonym for ''connectedness''.

Another example of connectivity can be found in regular tilings. Here, the connectivity describes the number of neighbors accessible from a single [[tile]]:

== Early life and education ==
Hennel was born in [[Evansville, Indiana]] to Joseph H. and Anna Marie Thuman Hennel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/archives/InU-Ar-VAC9620|title=Cecilia Hennel Hendricks family papers, 1843-1971, bulk 1896-1970|website=purl.dlib.indiana.edu|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school graduation Cora and her older sister [[Cecilia Hennel Hendricks|Cecilia]] taught in country grade schools to save money for college. In 1903, both Hennels entered [[Indiana University]] and shortly thereafter, convinced their parents to move with their younger sister, Edith, to [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. All three sisters attended and graduated from Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRbOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=Cora+B.+Hennel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RDcuIdHKPK&amp;sig=nGuRuG1qr6jwTTv-QdfwmGmJNFM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtgNjYhYLXAhUSyYMKHduyA04Q6AEIWjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Cora%20B.%20Hennel&amp;f=false|title=Pioneering Women in American Mathematics: The Pre-1940 PhD's| first1 = Judy | last1 = Green | author1-link = Judy Green (mathematician) | first2 = Jeanne | last2 = LaDuke | author2-link = Jeanne LaDuke|date=2009|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=9780821843765|language=en}} Biography on p.261-263 of the [https://www.ams.org/bookpages/hmath-34-PioneeringWomen.pdf Supplementary Material] at [https://www.ams.org/publications/authors/books/postpub/hmath-34 AMS]&lt;/ref&gt; Hennel earned her earned her A.B. in Mathematics in 1907, her Masters in 1908, and in 1912, became the first person to earn a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Indiana University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b2872360?urlappend=;seq=99|title=Indiana University Alumni Quarterly v. 1 1914.|website=HathiTrust|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an undergraduate, Cora was the class poet and active in student affairs; in graduate school, she was a founding member and Secretary of the Euclidean Circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/findingaids/view?doc.view=entire_text&amp;docId=InU-Ar-VAA2782|title=Euclidean Circle (Indiana University) records, 1907-1942|work=Archives online|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematics club for faculty and students.

== Career ==
As she worked toward her doctorate, Cora served as Instructor in the Department of Mathematics. She continued in this role after receipt of her degree and in 1916, she was appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematics. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1923 and became a full Professor in 1936.

A '''decimal representation''' of a [[non-negative]] [[real number]] ''r'' is an expression in the form of a [[series (mathematics)|series]], traditionally written as a sum

:&lt;math&gt; r=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{a_i}{10^i}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a nonnegative integer,  and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are integers satisfying 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;9, called the digits of the decimal representation. The sequence of digits specified may be finite, in which case any further digits ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are assumed to be 0. Some authors forbid decimal representations with a trailing infinite sequence of "9"s.&lt;ref name="Knuth_1973"/&gt;
This restriction still allows a decimal representation for each non-negative real number, but additionally makes such a representation unique.
The number defined by a decimal representation is often written more briefly as

:&lt;math&gt;r=a_0.a_1 a_2 a_3\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

That is to say, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the integer part of ''r'', not necessarily between 0 and 9, and  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... are the digits forming the fractional part of ''r''.

Both notations above are, by definition, the following [[limit of a sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt; r=\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{a_i}{10^i}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Finite decimal approximations==

Any real number can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by [[rational number]]s with finite decimal representations.

Assume &lt;math&gt;x\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then for every integer &lt;math&gt;n\geq 1&lt;/math&gt; there is a finite decimal &lt;math&gt;r_n=a_0.a_1a_2\cdots a_n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;r_n\leq x &lt; r_n+\frac{1}{10^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof''':

Let &lt;math&gt;r_n = \textstyle\frac{p}{10^n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p = \lfloor 10^nx\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;p \leq 10^nx &lt; p+1&lt;/math&gt;, and the result follows from dividing all sides by &lt;math&gt;10^n&lt;/math&gt;.
(The fact that &lt;math&gt;r_n&lt;/math&gt; has a finite decimal representation is easily established.)

==Non-uniqueness of decimal representation and notational conventions==
{{Main|0.999...}}
Some real numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; have two infinite decimal representations. For example, the number 1 may be equally represented by 1.000... as by [[0.999...]] (where the infinite sequences of trailing 0's or 9's, respectively, are represented by "..."). Conventionally, the decimal representation without trailing 9's is preferred.  Moreover, in the ''standard decimal representation'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, an infinite sequence of trailing 0's appearing after the [[Decimal mark|decimal point]] is omitted, along with the decimal point itself, if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. 

Certain procedures for constructing the decimal expansion of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will avoid the problem of trailing 9's.  For instance, the following procedure will give the standard decimal representation:  Given &lt;math&gt;x\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, we can first define &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; (the ''integer part'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) to be the largest integer such that &lt;math&gt;a_0\leq x&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;a_0 = \lfloor x\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;).  Then, for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;(a_i)_{i=0}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; already found, we define &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; inductively to be the largest integer such that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;a_0+\frac{a_1}{10}+\frac{a_2}{10^2}+\cdots+\frac{a_k}{10^k}\leq x.\quad\quad (*)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The procedure terminates when &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; is found such that equality holds in &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise, it continues indefinitely to give an infinite sequence of decimal digits.  It can be shown that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x = \sup _k\{\sum_{i=0}^{k}\frac{a_i}{10^i}\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter_1976"/&gt; (conventionally written as &lt;math&gt;x=a_0.a_1a_2a_3\cdots&lt;/math&gt;), with &lt;math&gt;a_0\in\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,a_2,a_3\ldots \in \{0,1,2,\ldots, 9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This construction is extended to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; by applying the above procedure to &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; and denoting the resultant decimal expansion by &lt;math&gt;-a_0.a_1a_2a_3\cdots&lt;/math&gt;.

==Finite decimal representations==

The decimal expansion of non-negative real number ''x'' will end in zeros (or in nines) if, and only if, ''x'' is a rational number whose denominator is of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''m'' and ''n'' are non-negative integers.

'''Proof''':

If the decimal expansion of ''x'' will end in zeros, or &lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{a_i}{10^i}=\sum_{i=0}^n10^{n-i}a_i/10^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''n'',
then the denominator of ''x'' is of the form 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Conversely, if the denominator of ''x'' is of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{p}{2^n5^m}=\frac{2^m5^np}{2^{n+m}5^{n+m}}=
\frac{2^m5^np}{10^{n+m}}&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''p''.
While ''x'' is of the form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{p}{10^k}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p=\sum_{i=0}^{n}10^ia_i&lt;/math&gt; for some ''n''.
By &lt;math&gt;x=\sum_{i=0}^n10^{n-i}a_i/10^n=\sum_{i=0}^n\frac{a_i}{10^i}&lt;/math&gt;,
''x'' will end in zeros.

==Recurring decimal representations==
{{Main|Repeating decimal}}
Some real numbers have decimal expansions that eventually get into loops, endlessly repeating a sequence of one or more digits:
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.33333...
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.142857142857...
:&lt;sup&gt;1318&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;185&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.1243243243...
Every time this happens the number is still a [[rational number]] (i.e. can alternatively be represented as a ratio of an integer and a positive integer).
Also the converse is true:  The decimal expansion of a rational number is either finite, or endlessly repeating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">{{short description|mathematical notion of infinitesimal difference}}
In [[mathematics]], '''differential''' refers to [[infinitesimal]] differences or to the [[derivative]]s of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/differential|title=differential - Definition of differential in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in various branches of mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[differential geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]].

==Basic notions==
* In [[calculus]], the [[differential of a function|differential]] represents a change in the [[linearization]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]].
** The [[total differential]] is its generalization for functions of multiple variables.
* In traditional approaches to calculus, the [[differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]] (e.g. ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dt'', etc.) are interpreted as [[infinitesimal]]s.  There are several methods of defining infinitesimals rigorously, but it is sufficient to say that an infinitesimal number is smaller in absolute value than any positive real number, just as an infinitely large number is larger than any real number.
* The [[Total derivative|differential]] is another name for the [[Jacobian matrix]] of [[partial derivative]]s of a function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (especially when this [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is viewed as a [[linear map]]).
* More generally, the [[Pushforward (differential)|differential]] or ''[[Pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]'' refers to the derivative of a map between [[smooth manifold]]s and the pushforward operations it defines. The differential is also used to define the dual concept of [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]].
* [[Stochastic calculus]] provides a notion of [[stochastic differential]] and an associated calculus for [[stochastic process]]es.
* The [[integrator]] in a [[Stieltjes integral]] is represented as the differential of a function.  Formally, the differential appearing under the integral behaves exactly as a differential: thus, the [[integration by substitution]] and [[integration by parts]] formulae for Stieltjes integral correspond, respectively, to the [[chain rule]] and [[product rule]] for the differential.

==Differential geometry==
The notion of a differential motivates several concepts in [[differential geometry]] (and [[differential topology]]).
*The [[Pushforward (differential)|differential (Pushforward)]] of a map between manifolds.
*[[Differential form]]s provide a framework which accommodates multiplication and differentiation of differentials.
*The [[exterior derivative]] is a notion of differentiation of differential forms which generalizes the [[Total derivative|differential]] of a function (which is a [[differential 1-form]]).
*[[Pullback (differential geometry)|Pullback]] is, in particular, a geometric name for the [[chain rule]] for composing a map between manifolds with a differential form on the target manifold.
*[[Covariant derivative|Covariant derivatives or differentials]] provide a general notion for differentiating of [[vector field]]s and [[tensor field]]s on a manifold, or, more generally, sections of a [[vector bundle]]: see [[Connection (vector bundle)]]. This ultimately leads to the general concept of a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]].

==Algebraic geometry==
Differentials are also important in [[algebraic geometry]], and there are several important notions.
* [[Abelian differential]]s usually refer to differential one-forms on an [[algebraic curve]] or [[Riemann surface]].
* [[Quadratic differential]]s (which behave like "squares" of abelian differentials) are also important in the theory of Riemann surfaces.
* [[Kähler differential]]s provide a general notion of differential in algebraic geometry.

==Other meanings==
The term ''differential'' has also been adopted in homological algebra and algebraic topology, because of the role the exterior derivative plays in de Rham cohomology: in a [[cochain complex]] &lt;math&gt;(C_\bullet, d_\bullet)&lt;/math&gt;, the maps (or ''coboundary operators'') ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are often called differentials. Dually, the boundary operators in a chain complex are sometimes called ''codifferentials''.

The properties of the differential also motivate the algebraic notions of a ''[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]'' and a ''[[differential algebra]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2723">The '''effective selfing model''' is a [[mathematical model]] that describes the [[mating system]] of a [[plant]] [[population]] in terms of the degree of [[self-fertilisation]] present.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ritland, Kermit | year = 1984 | title = The effective proportion of self-fertilisation with consanguineous matings in inbred populations | journal = Genetics | volume = 106 | pages = 139–152 | pmid = 17246188 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1202242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, A.

It was developed in the 1980s by Kermit Ritland, as an alternative to the simplistic [[mixed mating model]]. The mixed mating model assumes that every [[fertilisation]] event may be classed as either self-fertilisation, or [[outcrossing]] with a completely [[random]] mate. That is, it assumes that [[inbreeding]] is caused solely by self-fertilisation. This assumption is often violated in wild plant populations, where inbreeding may be due to outcrossing between closely related plants. For example, in dense stands, mating often occurs between plants in close proximity; and in plants with short [[seed dispersal]] distances, plants are often closely related to their nearest neighbours. When both these criteria are met, plants will tend to be closely related to the near neighbours with which they mate, resulting in significant inbreeding. In such a scenario, the mixed mating model will attribute all inbreeding to self-fertilisation, and therefore overestimate the extent of self-fertilisation occurring. The effective selfing model takes into account the potential for inbreeding to occur as a result of outcrossing between closely related plants, by considering the extent of kinship between mates.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

Ultimately, it is not possible to tease apart the two potential causes of inbreeding, and attributed the observed inbreeding to one cause or the other. Therefore, just as with the mixed mating model, in the effective selfing model there is only one parameter to be estimated. However this parameter, termed the '''effective selfing rate''', is often a more accurate measure of the proportion of self-fertilisation than the corresponding parameter in the mixed mating model.&lt;ref name="Ritland 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1989"/&gt;

An '''enrolled actuary''' is an [[actuary]] enrolled by the [[Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries]] under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA).&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|7701}}, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701#a_35 paragraph (a)(35)], and {{usc|29|1242}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolled actuaries, under regulations of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], perform a variety of tasks with respect to pension plans in the [[United States]] under ERISA. As of August 2016, there were approximately 4,200 enrolled actuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/enrolled_actuary_roster.pdf |title=Enrolled Actuary Roster |date=August 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries]] |type=PDF |accessdate=September 25, 2016 }}&lt;!-- Note: The roster consists of 183 pages with 23 actuaries per page, except 22 on the first page and 8 on the last. 22 + 181×22 + 8 = 4,193 enrolled actuaries. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications ==

The Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries administers two examinations to prospective enrolled actuaries. Once the two examinations have been passed, and an individual has also obtained sufficient relevant professional experience, that individual becomes an enrolled actuary.

The first exam (EA-1) tests basic knowledge of the mathematics of compound interest, the mathematics of life contingencies, and practical demographic analysis. 

The second (EA-2) examination consists of two segments, which are offered during separate exam sittings in either the fall or the spring. Segment F covers the selection of actuarial assumptions, actuarial cost methods, and the calculation of minimum (required) and maximum (tax-deductible) contributions to pension plans. Segment L tests knowledge of relevant federal pension laws (in particular, the provisions of ERISA) as they affect pension actuarial practice.

== Employers ==

Enrolled actuaries generally work for [[human resource consulting]] firms, investment and insurance brokers, accounting firms, government organizations, and law firms.  Some firms that employ enrolled actuaries combine two or more of these practice specialties.

== Organizations ==

Many enrolled actuaries belong to one or more of the following organizations:  the [[Society of Actuaries]], the [[American Academy of Actuaries]]. the [[Conference of Consulting Actuaries]] or the [[American Society of Pension Professionals &amp; Actuaries]].

See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.

The [[syntax]] is:
*The blank page;
*Single letters, phrases;
*Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
*The blank page denotes '''False''';
*Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be '''True''' or '''False''';
*To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''Truth''';
*All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the [[existential graph]]s, whose sentential (''alpha'') part is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed [[first-order logic]] and [[normal modal logic]].

The [[Laws of form|primary algebra]] of [[G. Spencer-Brown]] is isomorphic to the entitative graphs.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Euclid's ''Elements''}}
The '''''Elements''''' ({{lang-grc|Στοιχεῖα}} ''Stoicheia'') is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[treatise]] consisting of 13 books attributed to the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates, propositions ([[theorem]]s and [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructions]]), and [[mathematical proof]]s of the propositions. The books cover plane and solid [[Euclidean geometry]],  elementary [[number theory]], and [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lines. ''Elements'' is the oldest extant large-scale deductive treatment of [[mathematics]]. It has proven instrumental in the development of [[logic]] and modern [[science]], and its logical rigor was not surpassed until the 19th century.

Euclid's ''Elements'' has been referred to as the most successful&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece (2006) by Nigel Guy Wilson, page 278. Published by Routledge Taylor and Francis Group. Quote:"Euclid's Elements subsequently became the basis of all mathematical education, not only in the Roman and Byzantine periods, but right down to the mid-20th century, and it could be argued that it is the most successful textbook ever written."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer Author of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=100|quote=As teachers at the school he called a band of leading scholars, among whom was the author of the most fabulously successful mathematics textbook ever written – the ''Elements'' (''Stoichia'') of Euclid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influential&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|page=119|quote=The ''Elements'' of Euclid not only was the earliest major Greek mathematical work to come down to us, but also the most influential textbook of all times. [...]The first printed versions of the ''Elements'' appeared at Venice in 1482, one of the very earliest of mathematical books to be set in type; it has been estimated that since then at least a thousand editions have been published. Perhaps no book other than the Bible can boast so many editions, and certainly no mathematical work has had an influence comparable with that of Euclid's ''Elements''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; textbook ever written. It was one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] and has been estimated to be second only to the [[Bible]] in the number of editions published since the first printing in 1482,&lt;ref name="Boyer Influence of the Elements"/&gt; with the number reaching well over one thousand.&lt;ref&gt;The Historical Roots of Elementary Mathematics by Lucas Nicolaas Hendrik Bunt, Phillip S. Jones, Jack D. Bedient (1988), page 142. Dover publications. Quote:"the ''Elements'' became known to Western Europe via the Arabs and the Moors. There, the ''Elements'' became the foundation of mathematical education. More than 1000 editions of the ''Elements'' are known. In all probability, it is, next to the ''Bible'', the most widely spread book in the civilization of the Western world."&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, when the [[quadrivium]] was included in the curriculum of all university students, knowledge of at least part of Euclid's ''Elements'' was required of all students. Not until the 20th century, by which time its content was universally taught through other school textbooks, did it cease to be considered something all educated people had read.&lt;ref&gt;From the introduction by Amit Hagar to ''Euclid and His Modern Rivals'' by Lewis Carroll (2009, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble) pg. xxviii: &lt;blockquote&gt;Geometry emerged as an indispensable part of the standard education of the English gentleman in the eighteenth century; by the Victorian period it was also becoming an important part of the education of artisans, children at Board Schools, colonial subjects and, to a rather lesser degree, women. ... The standard textbook for this purpose was none other than Euclid's ''The Elements''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Oxyrhynchus papyrus with Euclid's Elements.jpg|thumb|A fragment of Euclid's ''Elements'' on part of the [[Oxyrhynchus papyri]] ]]

===Basis in earlier work===
[[Image:Woman teaching geometry.jpg|thumb|An illumination from a manuscript based on [[Adelard of Bath]]'s translation of the ''Elements'', ''circa'' 1309–1316; Adelard's is the oldest surviving translation of the ''Elements'' into Latin, done in the 12th-century work and translated from Arabic.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;]]
Scholars believe that the ''Elements'' is largely a compilation of propositions based on books by earlier Greek mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Awakening|last=van der Waerden|first=Bartel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proclus]] (412–485 AD), a Greek mathematician who lived around seven centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary on the ''Elements'': "Euclid, who put together the ''Elements'', collecting many of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]' theorems, perfecting many of [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]]', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors".

[[Pythagoras]] (c. 570–495 BC) was probably the source for most of books I and II, [[Hippocrates of Chios]] (c. 470–410 BC, not the better known [[Hippocrates|Hippocrates of Kos]]) for book III, and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (c. 408–355 BC) for book V, while books IV, VI, XI, and XII probably came from other Pythagorean or Athenian mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;W.W. Rouse Ball, A Short Account of the History of Mathematics, 4th ed., 1908, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Elements'' may have been based on an earlier textbook by Hippocrates of Chios, who also may have originated the use of letters to refer to figures.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission of the text===
In the fourth century AD, [[Theon of Alexandria]] produced an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until [[François Peyrard]]'s 1808 discovery at the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] of a manuscript not derived from Theon's. This manuscript, the [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Heiberg]] manuscript, is from a [[Byzantine]] workshop around 900 and is the basis of modern editions.&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?id=2749 --&gt;http://historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2749 The Earliest Surviving Manuscript Closest to Euclid's Original Text (Circa 850)]; an [http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_math.html image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220042513/http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_math.html |date=2009-12-20 }} of one page&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 29]] is a tiny fragment of an even older manuscript, but only contains the statement of one proposition.

Although known to, for instance, [[Cicero]], no record exists of the text having been translated into Latin prior to [[Boethius]] in the fifth or sixth century.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''. p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs received the ''Elements'' from the Byzantines around 760; this version was translated into [[Arabic]] under [[Harun al Rashid]] c. 800.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; The Byzantine scholar [[Arethas of Caesarea|Arethas]] commissioned the copying of one of the extant Greek manuscripts of Euclid in the late ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars'' 2nd. ed. (Oxford, 1974) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Although known in Byzantium, the ''Elements'' was lost to Western Europe until about 1120, when the English monk [[Adelard of Bath]] translated it into Latin from an Arabic translation.&lt;ref&gt;One older work claims Adelard disguised himself as a Muslim student to obtain a copy in Muslim Córdoba (Rouse Ball, p. 165). However, more recent biographical work has turned up no clear documentation that Adelard ever went to Muslim-ruled Spain, although he spent time in Norman-ruled Sicily and Crusader-ruled Antioch, both of which had Arabic-speaking populations.

Theon's Greek edition was recovered in 1533. In 1570, [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] provided a widely respected "Mathematical Preface", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by [[Henry Billingsley]].

Copies of the Greek text still exist, some of which can be found in the [[Vatican Library]] and the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. The manuscripts available are of variable quality, and invariably incomplete. By careful analysis of the translations and originals, hypotheses have been made about the contents of the original text (copies of which are no longer available).

Ancient texts which refer to the ''Elements'' itself, and to other mathematical theories that were current at the time it was written, are also important in this process. Such analyses are conducted by [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|J. L. Heiberg]] and Sir [[Thomas Little Heath]] in their editions of the text.

Also of importance are the [[scholia]], or annotations to the text. These additions, which often distinguished themselves from the main text (depending on the manuscript), gradually accumulated over time as opinions varied upon what was worthy of explanation or further study.

==Influence==
[[File:Euclid's Elements, 1482.jpg|thumb|A page with marginalia from the first printed edition of ''Elements'', printed by [[Erhard Ratdolt]] in 1482]]

The ''Elements'' is still considered a masterpiece in the application of [[logic]] to [[mathematics]]. In historical context, it has proven enormously influential in many areas of [[science]]. Scientists [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Galileo Galilei]], and Sir [[Isaac Newton]] were all influenced by the ''Elements'', and applied their knowledge of it to their work. Mathematicians and philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[Bertrand Russell]], have attempted to create their own foundational "Elements" for their respective disciplines, by adopting the axiomatized deductive structures that Euclid's work introduced.

The austere beauty of Euclidean geometry has been seen by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, "You never can make a lawyer if you do not understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went home to my father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ketcham, ''The Life of Abraham Lincoln'', at Project Gutenberg, {{cite web |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6811 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330083804/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6811 |archivedate=2015-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] wrote in her sonnet "[[s:Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare|Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare]]", "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". [[Einstein]] recalled a copy of the ''Elements'' and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the "holy little geometry book".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley R. Herschbach|Dudley Herschbach]], "Einstein as a Student," Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, page 3, web: [http://www.chem.harvard.edu/herschbach/Einstein_Student.pdf HarvardChem-Einstein-PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226002142/http://www.chem.harvard.edu/herschbach/Einstein_Student.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }}: about Max Talmud visited on Thursdays for six years.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alberteinsteinsite.com/einsteinyoung.html|title=Albert Einstein - Young Einstein|first=Joseph Prindle -|last=info@alberteinsteinsite.com|date=|website=www.alberteinsteinsite.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610041942/http://www.alberteinsteinsite.com/einsteinyoung.html|archivedate=10 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the ''Elements'' is due primarily to its logical presentation of most of the mathematical knowledge available to Euclid. Much of the material is not original to him, although many of the proofs are his. However, Euclid's systematic development of his subject, from a small set of axioms to deep results, and the consistency of his approach throughout the ''Elements'', encouraged its use as a textbook for about 2,000 years. The ''Elements'' still influences modern geometry books. Further, its logical axiomatic approach and rigorous proofs remain the cornerstone of mathematics.

== Contents ==
* Book 1 contains 5 postulates (including the famous [[parallel postulate]]) and 5 common notions, and covers important topics of plane geometry such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], equality of angles and [[area]]s, parallelism, the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the construction of various geometric figures.
* Book 2 contains a number of lemmas concerning the equality of rectangles and squares, sometimes referred to as "[[Greek geometric algebra|geometric algebra]]", and concludes with a construction of the [[golden ratio]] and a way of constructing a square equal in area to any rectilineal plane figure.
* Book 3 deals with circles and their properties: finding the center, [[inscribe]]d angles, [[tangent]]s, the power of a point, [[Thales' theorem]].
* Book 4 constructs the [[incircle]] and [[circumcircle]] of a triangle, as well as [[regular polygon]]s with 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides.
* Book 5, on proportions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitudes]], gives the highly sophisticated theory of proportion probably developed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], and proves properties such as "alternation" (if ''a'' : ''b'' :: ''c'' : ''d'', then ''a'' : ''c'' :: ''b'' : ''d'').
* Book 6 applies proportions to plane geometry, especially the construction and recognition of [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] figures.
* Book 7 deals with elementary number theory: [[divisibility]], [[prime number]]s and their relation to composite numbers, [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]], finding the [[least common multiple]].
* Book 8 deals with the construction and existence of [[geometric progression|geometric sequences]] of integers.
* Book 9 applies the results of the preceding two books and gives the [[infinitude of prime numbers]] and the construction of all even [[perfect number]]s.
* Book 10 proves the irrationality of the square roots of non-square integers (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;) and classifies the square roots of [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] lines into thirteen disjoint categories. Euclid here introduces the term "[[Irrational number|irrational]]", which has a different meaning than the modern concept of irrational numbers. He also gives a [[Euclid's formula|formula]] to produce [[Pythagorean triples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=June 1997 |last=Joyce |first=D. E. |chapterurl= https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookX/propX29.html |title=Euclid's Elements |chapter=Book X , Proposition XXIX |publisher=Clark University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Book 11 generalizes the results of book 6 to solid figures: perpendicularity, parallelism, volumes and similarity of [[parallelepiped]]s.
* Book 12 studies the volumes of [[cone (geometry)|cones]], [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], and [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]] in detail by using the [[method of exhaustion]], a precursor to [[integral|integration]], and shows, for example, that the volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder. It concludes by showing that the volume of a [[sphere]] is proportional to the cube of its radius (in modern language) by approximating its volume by a union of many pyramids.
* Book 13 constructs the five regular [[Platonic solid]]s inscribed in a sphere and compares the ratios of their edges to the radius of the sphere.

[[File:Euclid Vat ms no 190 I prop 47.jpg|thumb|Codex Vaticanus 190]]
Euclid's [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatic method|axiomatic approach]] and [[Euclidean geometry#Methods of proof|constructive methods]] were widely influential.

Many of Euclid's propositions were constructive, demonstrating the existence of some figure by detailing the steps he used to construct the object using a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]]. His constructive approach appears even in his geometry's postulates, as the first and third postulates stating the existence of a line and circle are constructive. Instead of stating that lines and circles exist per his prior definitions, he states that it is possible to 'construct' a line and circle. It also appears that, for him to use a figure in one of his proofs, he needs to construct it in an earlier proposition. For example, he proves the Pythagorean theorem by first inscribing a square on the sides of a right triangle, but only after constructing a square on a given line one proposition earlier.{{Sfn|Hartshorne|2000|pp=18–20}}

As was common in ancient mathematical texts, when a proposition needed [[Mathematical proof|proof]] in several different cases, Euclid often proved only one of them (often the most difficult), leaving the others to the reader. Later editors such as [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] often interpolated their own proofs of these cases.

Euclid's presentation was limited by the mathematical ideas and notations in common currency in his era, and this causes the treatment to seem awkward to the modern reader in some places. For example, there was no notion of an angle greater than two right angles,&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; the number 1 was sometimes treated separately from other positive integers, and as multiplication was treated geometrically he did not use the product of more than 3 different numbers. The geometrical treatment of number theory may have been because the alternative would have been the extremely awkward [[Greek numerals|Alexandrian system of numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 58, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of each result is given in a stylized form, which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the 'enunciation', which states the result in general terms (i.e., the statement of the proposition). Then comes the 'setting-out', which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the 'definition' or 'specification', which restates the enunciation in terms of the particular figure. Then the 'construction' or 'machinery' follows. Here, the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the 'proof' itself follows. Finally, the 'conclusion' connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1963), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

No indication is given of the method of reasoning that led to the result, although the ''[[Data (Euclid)|Data]]'' does provide instruction about how to approach the types of problems encountered in the first four books of the ''Elements''.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have tried to find fault in Euclid's use of figures in his proofs, accusing him of writing proofs that depended on the specific figures drawn rather than the general underlying logic, especially concerning Proposition II of Book I. However, Euclid's original proof of this proposition, is general, valid, and does not depend on the figure used as an example to illustrate one given configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfried Toussaint]], "A new look at Euclid's second proposition," ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 12–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Euclid's list of axioms in the ''Elements'' was not exhaustive, but represented the principles that were the most important. His proofs often invoke axiomatic notions which were not originally presented in his list of axioms. Later editors have interpolated Euclid's implicit axiomatic assumptions in the list of formal axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956) (vol. 1), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the first construction of Book 1, Euclid used a premise that was neither postulated nor proved: that two circles with centers at the distance of their radius will intersect in two points.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956) (vol. 1), p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the fourth construction, he used superposition (moving the triangles on top of each other) to prove that if two sides and their angles are equal, then they are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]; during these considerations he uses some properties of superposition, but these properties are not described explicitly in the treatise. If superposition is to be considered a valid method of geometric proof, all of geometry would be full of such proofs. For example, propositions I.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;I.3 can be proved trivially by using superposition.&lt;ref&gt;Heath (1956) (vol. 1), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematician and historian [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] put the criticisms in perspective, remarking that "the fact that for two thousand years [the ''Elements''] was the usual text-book on the subject raises a strong presumption that it is not unsuitable for that purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Ball (1960) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apocrypha ==
It was not uncommon in ancient time to attribute to celebrated authors works that were not written by them. It is by these means that the [[apocryphal]] books XIV and XV of the ''Elements'' were sometimes included in the collection.&lt;ref name="Boyer Apocrypha"/&gt; The spurious Book XIV was probably written by [[Hypsicles]] on the basis of a treatise by [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres, with the chief result being that the ratio of the surfaces of the [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]] inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\tfrac{10}{3(5-\sqrt{5})}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{6}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by [[Isidore of Miletus]]. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.&lt;ref name="Boyer Apocrypha"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=|year=1991|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria|pages=118–119|quote=In ancient times it was not uncommon to attribute to a celebrated author works that were not by him; thus, some versions of Euclid's ''Elements'' include a fourteenth and even a fifteenth book, both shown by later scholars to be apocryphal. The so-called Book XIV continues Euclid's comparison of the regular solids inscribed in a sphere, the chief results being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes, the ratio being that of the edge of the cube to the edge of the icosahedron, that is, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{10/[3(5-\sqrt{5})]}&lt;/math&gt;. It is thought that this book may have been composed by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise (now lost) by Apollonius comparing the dodecahedron and icosahedron. [...] The spurious Book XV, which is inferior, is thought to have been (at least in part) the work of Isidore of Miletus (fl. ca. A.D. 532), architect of the cathedral of Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) at Constantinople. This book also deals with the regular solids, counting the number of edges and solid angles in the solids, and finding the measures of the dihedral angles of faces meeting at an edge.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''European Women in Mathematics (EWM)''' is an international professional organization dedicated to supporting women's engagement in mathematics. Its goals include encouraging women to study mathematics and providing visibility to women mathematicians.  It is the "first and best known" of several organizations devoted to women in mathematics in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Caroline|last=Series|authorlink=Caroline Series|title=European Level Organisations for Women Mathematicians|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2013-12-90.pdf|magazine=EMS Newsletter|publisher=European Mathematical Society|volume=90|date=December 2013|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gifted''''' is a 2017 American [[drama film]] directed by [[Marc Webb]] and written by Tom Flynn. It stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Mckenna Grace]], [[Lindsay Duncan]], [[Jenny Slate]] and [[Octavia Spencer]]. The plot follows an [[intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]] 7-year-old who becomes the subject of a custody battle between her uncle and grandmother. The film was released on April 7, 2017, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], and grossed $43 million worldwide.

==Plot==
In a small town near [[Tampa, Florida]], seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with uncle and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 40-ish neighbor, Roberta. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson. There, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, she begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for [[Show and tell (education)|show-and-tell]] and later defends a classmate from a bully on the bus. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] children. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears Mary will not have a chance at a "normal" childhood.

It emerges that Mary's mother, Diane, had been a promising mathematician, dedicated to the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness|Navier–Stokes problem]] (one of the unsolved [[Millennium Prize Problems]]) before taking her own life when Mary was six months old. Mary has lived with Frank, a former college [[professor]] turned boat repairman, ever since.

Frank's estranged mother and Mary's maternal grandmother, Evelyn, seeks to gain custody of Mary and move her to [[Massachusetts]], believing that Mary is a "one-in-a-billion" mathematical prodigy who should be specially tutored in preparation for a life devoted to mathematics, much as Diane was. However, Frank is adamant that his sister would want Mary to be in a normal public school and have the childhood she didn't have. Worried that the judge will rule against him and he will lose Mary completely, Frank accepts a compromise brokered by his lawyer Greg Cullen that sees Mary placed in foster care and attend the private school where Evelyn wants to have her enrolled. The foster parents live just 25 minutes from Frank's home, Frank will be entitled to scheduled visits, and Mary will be able to decide where she wants to live after her 12th birthday.

Mary is devastated at being placed in foster care, and her foster father says she refuses to see Frank. When Bonnie sees a picture of Fred up for adoption, she alerts Frank. Frank retrieves the cat from the pound and, learning that Fred was brought in due to allergy issues, realizes that Evelyn—who is [[allergy|allergic]] to cats—is overseeing Mary's education in the guest house of Mary's foster home. He then reveals to Evelyn—who had been a mathematician herself—that Diane ''had'' solved the Navier–Stokes problem, but stipulated that the solution was to be withheld until Evelyn's death. Knowing that it meant everything to Evelyn to see Diane solve the problem, Frank offers Evelyn the opportunity to publish Diane's work if she drops her objection to his having custody of Mary. Evelyn reluctantly agrees.

The film ends with Mary back in the custody of Frank, returning to public school while taking college-level courses in the mornings.

{{Merge to|Commutative algebra#History|date=November 2017}}
In [[mathematics]], '''ideal theory''' is the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[commutative ring]]s; and is the precursor name for the contemporary subject of [[commutative algebra]]. The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] in [[algebraic geometry]], and the [[ideal class group]] in [[algebraic number theory]], of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] text on [[abstract algebra]] from around 1930.

The ideal theory in question had been based on [[elimination theory]], but in line with [[David Hilbert]]'s taste moved away from [[algorithm]]ic methods. [[Gröbner basis]] theory has now reversed the trend, for [[computer algebra]].

The importance of the ideal in general of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], more general than an ''ideal'', probably led to the perception that ''ideal theory'' was too narrow a description. [[Valuation theory]], too, was an important technical extension, and was used by [[Helmut Hasse]] and [[Oscar Zariski]].  [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] used ''commutative algebra''; sometimes ''local algebra'' is applied to the theory of [[local ring]]s. [[D. G. Northcott]]'s 1953 [[Cambridge Tract]] ''Ideal Theory'' (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.

The '''Indiana Pi Bill''' is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the [[Indiana General Assembly]], one of the most notorious attempts to establish [[mathematical truth]] by [[legislative fiat]]. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]], rather than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of a circle to its [[diameter]]. The bill, written by amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin, does imply various incorrect values of {{pi}}, such as 3.2.

The bill never became law, due to the intervention of Professor [[C. A. Waldo]] of [[Purdue University]], who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.

The impossibility of squaring the circle using only [[compass and straightedge constructions]], suspected since ancient times, was rigorously proven in 1882 by [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. Better approximations of {{pi}} than those implied by the bill have been known since ancient times.

== Legislative history ==
In 1894, [[Indiana]] physician and amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin (ca. 1825–1902&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|1992|p=195}}, citing an obituary&lt;/ref&gt;) believed that he had discovered a correct way of squaring the circle.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Goodwin (July 1894) "Quadrature of the circle," ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''1'''(7):  246–248.
*  See: [http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/localgov/Topics/Materials/Pi_Goodwin_AmMathMonthly_1894.pdf Purdue Agricultural Economics].
*  Reprinted in:  Lennart Berggren, Jonathan Borwein, and Peter Borwein, ''Pi:  A Source Book'', 3rd ed. (New York, New York:  Springer-Verlag, 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QlbzjN_5pDoC&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 230.]
*  See also:  Edward J. Goodwin (1895) "(A) The trisection of an angle; (B) Duplication of the cube," ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''2''': 337.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a bill to state representative Taylor I. Record, which Record introduced in the House under the long title "A Bill for an act introducing a new mathematical truth and offered as a contribution to education to be used only by the State of Indiana free of cost by paying any royalties whatever on the same, provided it is accepted and adopted by the official action of the Legislature of 1897".

The text of the bill consists of a series of mathematical claims (detailed below), followed by a recitation of Goodwin's previous accomplishments:

{{quote|... his solutions of the [[trisection of the angle]], [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle|quadrature of the circle]] having been already accepted as contributions to science by the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' ... And be it remembered that these noted problems had been long since given up by scientific bodies as unsolvable mysteries and above man's ability to comprehend.}} 

Goodwin's "solutions" were indeed published in the ''American Mathematical Monthly'', though with a disclaimer of "published by request of the author".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/ClearAFJ "Clearing the Misunderstanding Re My April Fool's `Joke'"], math.rutgers.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its introduction in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]], the bill's language and topic occasioned confusion among the membership; a member from [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] proposed that it be referred to the Finance Committee, but the Speaker accepted another member's recommendation to refer the bill to the Committee on Swamplands, where the bill could "find a deserved grave".&lt;ref name=hallerburg&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/ias/article/download/8180/8139 |title=House Bill No. 246 Revisited|first=Arthur E.|last=Hallenberg|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|pages=376–399|year=1974|volume=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|385}}  It was transferred to the Committee on Education, which reported favorably;&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/Indiana_Pi_Story.htm Indiana pi story] at a Purdue server&lt;/ref&gt; following a motion to [[Suspension of the rules|suspend the rules]], the bill passed on February 6,&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|390}} without a dissenting vote.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;  The news of the bill occasioned an alarmed response from ''Der Tägliche Telegraph'', a [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in Indianapolis, which viewed the event with significantly less favor than its English-speaking competitors.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|385}}  As this debate concluded, [[Purdue University]] Professor [[C. A. Waldo]] arrived in [[Indianapolis]] to secure the annual appropriation for the [[Indiana Academy of Science]]. An assemblyman handed him the bill, offering to introduce him to the genius who wrote it. He declined, saying that he already met as many crazy people as he cared to.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;&lt;ref name="waldo-ref"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldo|first1=C. A.|title=What Might Have Been|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|date=1916|pages=445–446|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/|accessdate=24 April 2017|ref=waldo-ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it reached the [[Indiana Senate]], the bill was not treated so kindly, for Waldo had coached the senators previously.  The committee to which it had been assigned reported it unfavorably, and the Senate [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled]] it on February 12;&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|386}} it was nearly passed, but opinion changed when one senator observed that the General Assembly lacked the power to define mathematical truth.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|391}}  Influencing some of the senators was a report that major newspapers, such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', had begun to ridicule the situation.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|390}}

According to the ''Indianapolis News'' article of February 13, page 11, column 3:&lt;ref name="indianapolis-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MATHEMATICAL BILL. Fun-Making In the Senate Yester-day Afternoon--Other Action.|url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=INN18970213-01.1.11|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=Indianapolis News|date=13 February 1897|ref=indianapolis-news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the bill was brought up and made fun of.  The Senators made bad puns about it, ridiculed it and laughed over it.  The fun lasted half an hour.  Senator Hubbell said that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing the State $250 a day, to waste its time in such frivolity.  He said that in reading the leading newspapers of Chicago and the East, he found that the Indiana State Legislature had laid itself open to ridicule by the action already taken on the bill.  He thought consideration of such a proposition was not dignified or worthy of the Senate.  He moved the indefinite postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mathematics ==

=== Approximation of π ===

Although the bill has become known as the "Pi Bill", its text does not mention the name "pi" at all, and Goodwin appears to have thought of the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle as distinctly secondary to his main aim of squaring the circle. Towards the end of Section 2 the following passage appears:

{{quote|Furthermore, it has revealed the ratio of the chord and arc of ninety degrees, which is as seven to eight, and also the ratio of the diagonal and one side of a square which is as ten to seven, disclosing the fourth important fact, that the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four[.]&lt;ref name="bill_text"&gt;[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/indiana_pi_bill.htm Text of the bill]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This comes close to an explicit claim that &lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{4}{1.25} = 3.2&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.429&lt;/math&gt;.

This quotation is often read as three mutually incompatible assertions, but they fit together well if the statement about {{radic|2}} is taken to be about the inscribed square (with the circle's diameter as diagonal) rather than the square on the radius (with the chord of 90° as diagonal). Together they describe the circle shown in the figure, whose diameter is 10 and circumference is 32; the chord of 90° is taken to be 7. Both of the values 7 and 32 are within a few percent of the true lengths for a diameter-10 circle (which does not justify Goodwin's presentation of them as exact). The circumference should be nearer to 31.4159 and the diagonal "7" should be the [[square root]] of 50 (=25+25), or nearer to 7.071.

=== Area of the circle ===

Goodwin's main goal was not to measure lengths in the circle but to ''square'' it, which he interpreted literally as finding a square with the same area as the circle. He knew that [[Archimedes]]' formula for the area of a circle, which calls for multiplying the diameter by one fourth of the circumference, is not considered a solution to the ancient problem of [[squaring the circle]]. This is because the problem is to ''construct'' the area using [[compass and straightedge]] only, and Archimedes did not give a method for constructing a straight line with the same length as the circumference. Apparently, Goodwin was unaware of this central requirement; he believed that the problem with the Archimedean formula is that it gives wrong numerical results, and that a solution of the ancient problem should consist of replacing it with a "correct" formula. In the bill he proposed, without argument, his own method:

{{quote|It has been found that a circular area is to the square on a line equal to the quadrant of the circumference, as the area of an equilateral rectangle is to the square on one side.&lt;ref name="bill_text" /&gt;}}

This appears needlessly convoluted, as an "[[equilateral]] rectangle" is, by definition, a [[square]]. In simple terms, the assertion is that the area of a circle is the same as that of a square with the same perimeter. This claim results in other mathematical contradictions to which Goodwin attempts to respond. For example, right after the above quote the bill goes on to say:

{{quote|The diameter employed as the linear unit according to the present rule in computing the circle's area is entirely wrong, as it represents the circle's area one and one-fifth times the area of a square whose perimeter is equal to the circumference of the circle.}}

In the model circle above, the Archimedean area (accepting Goodwin's values for the circumference and diameter) would be 80, whereas Goodwin's proposed rule leads to an area of 64. Now, 80 exceeds 64 by one fifth ''of 80'', and Goodwin appears to confuse 64 = 80×(1−{{frac|5}}) with 80 = 64×(1+{{frac|5}}), an approximation that works only for fractions much smaller than {{frac|5}}.

The area found by Goodwin's rule is {{frac|{{pi}}|4}} times the true area of the circle, which in many accounts of the Pi Bill is interpreted as a claim that {{pi}} = 4. However, there is no internal evidence in the bill that Goodwin intended to make such a claim; on the contrary, he repeatedly denies that the area of the circle has anything to do with its diameter.

The relative ''area'' error of 1−{{frac|{{pi}}|4}} works out to about 21 percent, which is much more grave than the approximations of the ''lengths'' in the model circle of the previous section. It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see [[isoperimetry]]); the typical demonstration of this fact is to compare a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.

The '''Inverse Symbolic Calculator''' is an online [[number checker]] established July 18, 1995 by [[Peter Benjamin Borwein]], [[Jonathan Michael Borwein]] and [[Simon Plouffe]] of the Canadian Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (Burnaby, Canada). A user will input a number and the Calculator will use an algorithm to search for and calculate [[closed-form expression]]s or suitable functions that have roots near this number. Hence, the calculator is of great importance for those working in numerical areas of [[experimental mathematics]].

The ISC contains 54 million mathematical constants. [[Plouffe's Inverter]] (opened in 1998) contains 214 million. A newer version of the tables with 3.702 billion entries (as of June 19, 2010) exists.

In 2016, Plouffe released a portable version of Plouffe's Inverter containing 3 billion entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plouffe.fr/Simon%20Plouffe.htm |title=''Page maison de Simon Plouffe'' |publisher=plouffe.fr |accessdate=29 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Pérès''' (31 October 1890 – 12 February 1962) was a French mathematician.

Pérès was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] on 31 October 1890.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Peres.html|title=Pérès biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former student of the [[Ecole Normale Superieure]], he worked in Rome with [[Vito Volterra]] and defended his doctoral thesis in 1915.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1920 he became a lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences of Strasbourg and in 1921 held the mechanics chair of the faculty of sciences of Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costabel|first=Pierre|title=Joseph Pérès (1890-1962)|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/rhs_0048-7996_1962_num_15_2_4424|journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences et de leurs applications|volume=15|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, he was appointed lecturer at the Faculty of Paris. He was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in 1942. He held the chair of mechanics in 1950 and Dean of the Faculty of Science in 1954, succeeding [[Albert Châtelet]]. During his deanship, he undertakes the creation of the Orsay campus. He was also one of the founders of the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] and its first président until his death.

In [[algebra]], the terms '''left''' and '''right''' denote the order of a [[binary operation]] (usually, but not always called "[[multiplication]]") in non-[[commutative property|commutative]] [[algebraic structure]]s.
A binary operation&amp;nbsp;∗ is usually written [[infix notation|in the infix form]]:
:{{bigmath|''s'' ∗ ''t''}}
The [[argument of a function|argument]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|s}} is placed on the left side, and the argument&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|t}} is on the right side. Even if the symbol of the operation is omitted, the order of {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} does matter unless ∗ is commutative.

A '''two-sided''' property is fulfilled on both sides. A '''one-sided''' property is related to one (unspecified) of two sides.

Although terms are similar, left–right distinction in algebraic parlance is not related either to [[one-sided limit|left and right limits]] in calculus, or to [[orientation (geometry)|left and right in geometry]].

== Binary operation as an operator ==
A binary operation&amp;nbsp;{{bigmath|∗}} may be considered as a [[parametric family|family]] of [[unary operation|unary]] [[operator (mathematics)|operators]] through [[currying]]
:{{bigmath|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') = ''s'' ∗ ''t''}},
depending on&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|t}} as a parameter. It is the family of ''right'' operations. Similarly,
:{{bigmath|1=''L''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') = ''s'' ∗ ''t''}}
defines the family of ''left'' operations parametrized with&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|s}}.

If for some&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|e}}, the left operation&amp;nbsp;{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[identity function|identical]], then {{mvar|e}} is called a left [[identity element|identity]]. Similarly, if {{math|1=''R''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''id''}}, then {{mvar|e}} is a right identity.

In [[ring theory]], a subring which is [[invariant set|invariant]] under ''any'' left multiplication in a ring, is called a left [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]. Similarly, a right multiplications-invariant subring is a right ideal.

== Left and right modules ==
Over [[non-commutative ring]]s, the left–right distinction is applied to [[module (mathematics)|modules]], namely to specify the side where a scalar (module element) appear in the [[scalar multiplication]]. 
{| align=center class="wikitable"
 !Left module
 !Right module
 |- align=center
 |{{bigmath|1=''s''('''x''' + '''y''') = ''s'''''x''' + ''s'''''y'''}}&lt;br/&gt;{{bigmath|1=(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'''x''' = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''x''' + ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''x'''}} &lt;br/&gt;{{bigmath|1=''s''(''t'''''x''') = (''s t'')'''x'''}}
 |{{bigmath|1=('''x''' + '''y''')''t'' = '''x'''''t'' + '''y'''''t''}}&lt;br/&gt; {{bigmath|1='''x'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''x'''''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''x'''''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;br/&gt;{{bigmath|1=('''x'''''s'')''t'' = '''x'''(''s t'')}}
 |}
The distinction is not purely syntactical because implies two different associativity rules (the lowest row in the table) which link multiplication in a module with multiplication in a ring.

A [[bimodule]] is simultaneously a left and right module, with two ''different'' scalar multiplication operations, obeying an obvious associativity condition on them.

== Other examples ==
* [[left eigenvector]]s
* left and right [[group action]]s

== In category theory ==
In [[category theory]] the usage of "left" is "right" has some algebraic resemblance, but refers to left and right sides of [[morphism]]s. See [[adjoint functors]].

{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

A number of different formulae, more than hundred, have been proposed as means of calculating [[price index]]es.  While price index formulae all use price and possibly quantity data, they aggregate these in different ways.  A price index aggregates various combinations of base period prices (&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;), later period prices (&lt;math&gt;p_t&lt;/math&gt;), base period quantities (&lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;), and later period quantities (&lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt;). Price index numbers are usually defined either in terms of (actual or hypothetical) expenditures (expenditure = price * quantity) or as different weighted averages of price relatives (&lt;math&gt;p_t/p_0&lt;/math&gt;). These tell the relative change of the price in question. Two of the most commonly used price index formulae were defined by German economists and statisticians [[Étienne Laspeyres]] and [[Hermann Paasche]], both around 1875 when investigating price changes in Germany.

==Laspeyres==
Developed in 1871 by [[Étienne Laspeyres|Laspeyres]], the formula:
:&lt;math&gt; P_{L}=\frac{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot q_{0}\right)}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{0}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

compares the total cost of the same basket of goods &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; at the old and new prices.

==Paasche==
Developed in 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/cpi/1587.htm|title=Q&amp;A about the Consumer Price Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hermann Paasche|Paasche]], the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{P}=\frac{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot q_{t}\right)}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{t}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

compares the total cost of a new basket of goods &lt;math&gt;q_t&lt;/math&gt; at the old and new prices.

==Geometric means==
The geometric means index:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{GM}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,0}}\right)^\frac{p_{i,0}\cdot q_{i,0}}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{0}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

incorporates quantity information through the share of expenditure in the base period.

==Unweighted indices==
Unweighted, or "elementary", price indices only compare prices of a single type of good between two periods. They do not make any use of quantities or expenditure weights. They are called "elementary" because they are often used at the lower levels of aggregation for more comprehensive price indices.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 598.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case, they are not indices but merely an intermediate stage in the calculation of an index. At these lower levels, it is argued that weighting is not necessary since only one type of good is being aggregated. However this implicitly assumes that only one type of the good is available (e.g. only one brand and one package size of frozen peas) and that it has not changed in quality etc between time periods.

===Carli===
Developed in 1764 by [[Giovanni Rinaldo|Carli]], an Italian economist, this formula is the [[arithmetic mean]] of the price relative between a period ''t'' and a base period ''0''.{{Fix|text=The formula does not make clear over what the summation is done.}}
:&lt;math&gt;P_{C}=\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum\frac{p_{t}}{p_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;

On 17 August 2012 the BBC Radio 4 program "More or Less" noted that the Carli index, used in part in the British Retail Price Index measure, has a built-in bias towards recording inflation even when over successive periods there is no increase in prices overall.{{clarifyme|date=November 2017}}{{Fix|text=Explain why}}

===Dutot===
In 1738 French economist Dutot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/working-papers/2009/wp2009-10-pdf|title=The Life and Times of Nicolas Dutot|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed using an index calculated by dividing the average price in period ''t'' by the average price in period ''0''.
:&lt;math&gt;P_{D}=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum p_{t}}{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum p_{0}}=\frac{\sum p_{t}}{\sum p_{0}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Jevons===
In 1863, English economist [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] proposed taking the [[geometric average]] of the price relative of period ''t'' and base period ''0''.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 602.&lt;/ref&gt; When used as an elementary aggregate, the Jevons index is considered a constant elasticity of substitution index since it allows for product substitution between time periods.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 596.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{J}=\left(\prod\frac{p_{t}}{p_{0}}\right)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the formula that was used for the old Financial Times stock market index (the predecessor of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]). It was inadequate for that purpose. In particular, if the price of any of the constituents were to fall to zero, the whole index would fall to zero. That is an extreme case; in general the formula will understate the total cost of a basket of goods (or of any subset of that basket) unless their prices all change at the same rate. Also, as the index is unweighted, large price changes in selected constituents can transmit to the index to an extent not representing their importance in the average portfolio.

===Harmonic mean of price relatives===
The harmonic average counterpart to the Carli index.&lt;ref name="PPI manual, 600"&gt;PPI manual, 600.&lt;/ref&gt;  The index was proposed by Jevons in 1865 and by Coggeshall in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Export and Import manual, Chapter 20 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{HR}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum\frac{p_{0}}{p_{t}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Carruthers, Sellwood, Ward, Dalén index===
Is the geometric mean of the Carli and the harmonic price indexes.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 597.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 Fisher wrote that this and the Jevons were the two best unweighted indexes based on Fisher's test approach to index number theory.&lt;ref&gt;Export and Import manual, Chapter 20, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{CSWD}=\sqrt{P_{C}\cdot P_{HR}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Ratio of harmonic means===
The ratio of harmonic means or "Harmonic means" price index is the harmonic average counterpart to the Dutot index.&lt;ref name="PPI manual, 600"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{RH}=\frac{\sum\frac{n}{p_{0}}}{\sum\frac{n}{p_{t}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Bilateral formulae==

=== Marshall-Edgeworth ===
The Marshall-Edgeworth index, credited to [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall]] (1887) and [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]] (1925),&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, Chapter 15, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; is a weighted relative of current period to base period sets of prices. This index uses the arithmetic average of the current and based period quantities for weighting. It is considered a pseudo-superlative formula and is symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, 620.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the Marshall-Edgeworth index can be problematic in cases such as a comparison of the price level of a large country to a small one.  In such instances, the set of quantities of the large country will overwhelm those of the small one.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, Chapter 15, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{ME}=\frac{\sum\left[p_{t}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\right)\right]}{\sum\left[p_{0}\cdot \frac{1}{2}(q_{0}+q_{t})\right]}=\frac{\sum\left[p_{t}\cdot\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\right)\right]}{\sum\left[p_{0}\cdot\left(q_{0}+q_{t}\right)\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Superlative indices ===
Superlative indices treat prices and quantities equally across periods. They are symmetrical and provide close approximations of [[cost of living index|cost of living indices]] and other theoretical indices used to provide guidelines for constructing price indices.  All superlative indices produce similar results and are generally the favored formulas for calculating price indices.&lt;ref&gt;ILO CPI manual, Chapter 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  A superlative index is defined technically as "an index that is exact for a flexible functional form that can provide a [[order of approximation|second-order approximation]] to other twice-differentiable functions around the same point."&lt;ref&gt;Export and Import manual, Chapter 18, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fisher ====
The change in a Fisher index from one period to the next is the [[geometric mean]] of the changes in Laspeyres's and Paasche's indexes between those periods, and these are chained together to make comparisons over many periods:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{F}=\sqrt{P_{L}\cdot P_{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is also called Fisher's "ideal" price index.

==== Törnqvist ====
{{further|Törnqvist index}}
The Törnqvist or Törnqvist-Theil index is the geometric average of the n price relatives of the current to base period prices (for n goods) weighted by the arithmetic average of the value shares for the two periods.&lt;ref&gt;PPI manual, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/omni/omni.nsf/wwwglsry/tornqvist+index+and+other+log-change+index+numbers "Tornqvist Index and other Log-change Index Numbers"], Statistics New Zealand Glossary of Common Terms.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{T}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,0}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{p_{i,0}\cdot q_{i,0}}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot q_{0}\right)}+\frac{p_{i,t}\cdot q_{i,t}}{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot q_{t}\right)}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Walsh ====
The Walsh price index is the weighted sum of the current period prices divided by the weighted sum of the base period prices with the geometric average of both period quantities serving as the weighting mechanism:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{W}=\frac{\sum\left(p_{t}\cdot\sqrt{q_{0}\cdot q_{t}}\right)}{\sum\left(p_{0}\cdot\sqrt{q_{0}\cdot q_{t}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6774">"'''Lobachevsky'''" is a humorous song by [[Tom Lehrer]], referring to the mathematician [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.revisited.html#6 |title=Lobachevsky |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Lehrer, the song is "not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky's] character" and the name was chosen "solely for [[prosodic]] reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes, "The Tom Lehrer Collection", ''Shout!'' Factory, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt;

In the introduction, Lehrer describes the song as an adaptation of a routine that [[Danny Kaye]] did to honor the Russian actor [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref name="bessman"/&gt; (The Danny Kaye routine is sung from the perspective of a famous Russian actor who learns and applies Stanislavski's secret to method acting: "Suffer.") &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXI2djKeerQ The Stanislavski routine] performed on the Danny Kaye Radio Show &lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer sings the song from the point of a view of a preeminent Russian mathematician who learns, from Lobachevsky, that [[plagiarism]] is the secret of success in mathematics (though adding "only be sure always to call it please '[[research]]'"). The narrator later uses this strategy to get a paper published ahead of a rival, then to write a book and earn a fortune selling the movie rights.

Lehrer wrote that he did not know [[Russian language|Russian]]. In the song he quotes two book reviews in Russian; the first is a long sentence that he then translates succinctly as "It stinks". The second, a different but equally long sentence, is also translated as "It stinks." The actual text of these sentences bear no relation to academics: the first phrase quotes [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''Song of the Flea'': "Once there was a king who had a pet flea." The second references a Russian joke: "Now I must go where even the Tsar goes on foot" [the bathroom].&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"&gt;{{cite web |title="Lobachevsky" Words and music by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/physics/songs/lehrer/lobachevsky.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was first performed as part of ''The Physical Revue,'' a 1951–1952 musical [[revue]] by Lehrer and a few other professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Physical Revue, by Tom Lehrer |url=http://www.haverford.edu/astronomy/songs/lehrer/physrev.htm |publisher=PhysicsSongs.org |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is track 6 on ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'', which was re-released as part of ''[[Songs &amp; More Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' and ''[[The Remains of Tom Lehrer]]''. In this early version, [[Ingrid Bergman]] is named to star in the role of "[[Hypotenuse]]" in ''The Eternal Triangle'', a film purportedly based on the narrator's book.&lt;ref name="Calder2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigel Calder|title=Magic Universe: A Grand Tour of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4NfZ9FDcc8C&amp;pg=PT639 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-162235-9|page=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded again for ''[[Revisited (Tom Lehrer album)]]'', with [[Brigitte Bardot]] as Hypotenuse. A third recording is included in ''[[Tom Lehrer Discovers Australia (And Vice Versa)]]'', a live album recorded in Australia, featuring [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Hypotenuse. A fourth recording was made in 1966 when ''Songs by Tom Lehrer'' was reissued in stereo, with [[Doris Day]] playing Hypotenuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.diff.html |title=Tom Lehrer lyric variations |date=April 2, 1995 |publisher=The Demented Music Database |accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lobachevsky.htm"/&gt;

The '''''MAOL table book''''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''MAOL-taulukot'') is a book published by MAOL, the [[Finland|Finnish]] association for teachers of mathematical subjects and distributed by [[Otava (publisher)|Otava]]. It is a book of numeric tables to aid in studying [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] at the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] level. The book includes a list of mathematical notation and symbols, a diverse collection of formulae, and several numeric tables. The Finnish matricular examination board has accepted the book and allowed it to be used in the Finnish [[abitur]] examinations.

The colour of the cover of the book is changed with each edition of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30550">In [[mathematics]], a  '''Leibniz or Madhava series''' is any one of the series in a collection of [[infinite series]] expressions all of which are believed to have been discovered by [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1350 – c.&amp;nbsp;1425), the founder of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] and later by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], among others. These expressions are the [[Maclaurin series]] expansions of the trigonometric [[sine]], [[cosine]] and [[arctangent]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], and the special case of the power series expansion of the arctangent function yielding a formula for computing π. The power series expansions of sine and cosine functions are respectively called ''Madhava's sine series'' and ''Madhava's cosine series''.  The power series expansion of the arctangent function is sometimes called ''Madhava–Gregory series''&lt;ref&gt;Reference to Gregory–Madhava series: {{Cite web|url=http://www.luigigobbi.com/EarliestKnownUsesOfSomeOfTheWordsOfMathematics/G-K.htm|title=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reference to Gregory–Madhava series: {{Cite web|url=http://www.mat.uc.pt/~jaimecs/pessoal/hpm.html|title=History of Mathematics in the classroom|last=Jaime Carvalho e Silva|date = July 1994|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Gregory–Madhava series''. These power series are also collectively called  ''Taylor–Madhava series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Topic entry on complex analysis : Introduction|publisher=PlanetMath.org|url=http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ComplexAnalytic2.html|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula for π is  referred to as ''Madhava–[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] series'' or ''Madhava–[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] series'' or [[Leibniz formula for pi]] or Leibnitz–Gregory–Madhava series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascal Sebah|author2=Xavier Gourdon|year=2004|title=Collection of series for pi|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/tkohl/teaching/spring2008/piSeries.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These further names for the various series are reflective of the names of the [[Western world|Western]] discoverers or popularizers of the respective series.

The derivations use many calculus related concepts such as summation, rate of change, and interpolation, which suggests that Indian mathematicians had a solid understanding of the basics of calculus long before it was developed in Europe. There is no evidence, however, that any of his ideas went out of Kerala. The [[calculus]] was still in its primitive stages and it would remain so until [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Leibniz]] entered the scene. Even though they had very basic ideas on the infinite series, Indian Mathematicians were not able to convert calculus to the modern problem solving tool that it is today.
No surviving works of Madhava contain explicit statements regarding the expressions which are now referred to as Madhava series. However, in the writing of later members of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] like [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] and [[Jyeshthadeva]] one can find unambiguous attributions of these series to Madhava. It is also in the works of these later astronomers and mathematicians one can trace the Indian proofs of these series expansions. These proofs provide enough indications about the approach Madhava had adopted to arrive at his series expansions.

Unlike most previous cultures, which had been rather nervous about the concept of infinity, Madhava was more than happy to play around with infinity, particularly infinite series. He showed how, although one can be approximated by adding a half plus a quarter plus an eighth plus a sixteenth, etc., (as even the ancient Egyptians and Greeks had known), the exact total of one can only be achieved by adding up infinitely many fractions. But Madhava went further and linked the idea of an infinite series with geometry and trigonometry. He realized that, by successively adding and subtracting different odd number fractions to infinity, he could home in on an exact formula for π (this was two centuries before Leibniz was to come to the same conclusion in Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How Mechanics Shaped the Modern World |edition=illustrated |first1=David |last1=Allen |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2013 |isbn=978-3-319-01701-3 |page=156 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRm4BAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRm4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 Extract of page 156]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Madhava's series in modern notations==
In the writings of the mathematicians and astronomers of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]], Madhava's series are described couched in the terminology and concepts fashionable at that time. When we translate these ideas into the notations and concepts of modern-day mathematics, we obtain the current equivalents of Madhava's series. These present-day counterparts of the infinite series expressions discovered by Madhava are the following:

==Madhava series in "Madhava's own words"==
None of Madhava's works, containing any of the series expressions attributed to him, have survived. These series expressions are found in the writings of the followers of Madhava in the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala school]]. At many places these authors have clearly stated that these are "as told by Madhava". Thus the enunciations of the various series found in [[Tantrasamgraha]] and its commentaries can be safely assumed to be in "Madhava's own words". The translations of the relevant verses as given in the ''Yuktidipika'' commentary of [[Tantrasamgraha]]  (also known as ''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]] (circa. 1500 - 1560 CE)  are reproduced below. These are then rendered in current mathematical notations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.K.

==Madhava's sine series==

===In Madhava's own words===

Madhava's sine series is stated in verses 2.440 and 2.441 in ''Yukti-dipika'' commentary (''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]]. A translation of the verses follows.

''Multiply the arc by the square of the arc, and take the result of repeating that (any number of times). Divide (each of the above numerators)  by the squares of the successive even numbers increased by that number and multiplied by the square of the radius.  Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above. These together give the jiva, as collected together in the verse beginning with "vidvan" etc. ''

===Rendering in modern notations===

Let ''r'' denote the radius of the circle and ''s'' the arc-length.

*The following numerators are formed first:
:: &lt;math&gt;s \cdot s^2 ,\qquad s \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 , \qquad s \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2, \qquad \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*These are then divided by quantities specified in the verse.
:: &lt;math&gt;s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}, \qquad s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2},\qquad s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2+6)r^2}, \qquad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
*Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above to get ''jiva'':
::&lt;math&gt; \text{jiva}= s - \left [ s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2} - \left [ s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2} -\left [ s\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2+2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2+4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2+6)r^2}-\cdots\right]\right]\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Transformation to current notation===

Let θ be the angle subtended by the arc ''s'' at the centre of the circle. Then ''s'' = ''r θ'' and ''jiva'' = ''r'' sin ''θ''. Substituting these in the last expression and simplifying we get
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^5}{5!} - \frac{\theta^7}{7!} + \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
which is the infinite power series expansion of the sine function.

===Madhava's reformulation for numerical computation===
The last line in the verse &amp;prime;''as collected together in the verse beginning with "vidvan" etc.''&amp;prime; is a reference to a reformulation of the series introduced by Madhava himself to make it convenient for easy computations for specified values of the arc and the radius.
For such a reformulation, Madhava considers a circle one-quarter of which measures 5400 minutes (say ''C'' minutes) and develops a scheme for the easy computations of the ''jiva''&amp;prime;s of the various arcs of such a circle. Let ''R'' be the radius of a circle one-quarter of which measures C.
Madhava had already computed the value of π using his series formula for π.&lt;ref name="Raju"&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.K. Raju|title=Cultural foundations of mathematics: The nature of mathematical proof and the transmission of calculus from India to Europe in the 16 thc. CE|publisher=Centre for Studies in Civilizations|location=Delhi|year=2007|series=History of Philosophy, Science and Culture in Indian Civilization|volume=X Part 4|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this value of π, namely  3.1415926535922, the radius ''R'' is computed as follows:
Then

:''R'' = 2 &amp;times; 5400 / &amp;pi; = 3437.74677078493925 = 3437 [[arcminute]]s 44 [[arcsecond]]s  48 sixtieths of an [[arcsecond]] = 3437&amp;prime;  44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  48&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.

Madhava's  expression for ''jiva'' corresponding to any arc ''s'' of a circle of radius ''R'' is equivalent to the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{jiva } &amp; = s - \frac{s^3}{R^2(2^2+2)} + \frac{s^5}{R^4(2^2+2)(4^2+4)}- \cdots \\[6pt]
&amp; = s  - \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^3 \left [   \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^3}{3!} 
- \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left [  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^5}{5!}
 - \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left [  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^7}{7!} - \cdots  \right ]\right]\right].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Madhava now  computes the following values:

|  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; vi-dvān &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The ''jiva'' can now be computed using the following scheme:

:''jiva'' = ''s'' &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [ (2220&amp;prime; 39&amp;prime;&amp;prime;   40&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus;  (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (273&amp;prime;  57&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  47&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (16&amp;prime; 05&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  41&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[ (33&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 06&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  (44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime; ) ] ] ] ].

This gives an approximation of ''jiva'' by its Taylor polynomial of the 11'th order. It involves one division, six multiplications and five subtractions only. Madhava prescribes this numerically efficient computational scheme in the following words (translation of verse 2.437 in ''Yukti-dipika''):

''vi-dvān, tu-nna-ba-la, ka-vī-śa-ni-ca-ya, sa-rvā-rtha-śī-la-sthi-ro, ni-rvi-ddhā-nga-na-rē-ndra-rung . Successively multiply these five numbers in order by the square of the arc divided by the quarter of the circumference (5400&amp;prime;), and subtract from the next number. (Continue this process with the result so obtained and the next number.) Multiply the final result by the cube of the arc divided by quarter of the circumference and subtract from the arc.''

==Madhava's cosine series==

===In Madhava's own words===

Madhava's cosine series is stated in verses 2.442 and 2.443 in ''Yukti-dipika'' commentary (''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]]. A translation of the verses follows.

''Multiply the square of the arc by the unit (i.e. the radius) and take the result of repeating that (any number of times). Divide (each of the above numerators) by the square of the successive even numbers decreased by that number and multiplied by the square of the radius. But the first term is (now)(the one which is) divided by twice the radius. Place the successive results so obtained one below the other and subtract each from the one above. These together give the śara as collected together in the verse beginning with stena, stri, etc. ''

===Rendering in modern notations===

Let ''r'' denote the radius of the circle and ''s'' the arc-length.

*The following numerators are formed first:
:: &lt;math&gt;r \cdot s^2 ,\qquad r \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 , \qquad r \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 \cdot s^2 , \qquad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
*These are then divided by quantities specified in the verse.
:: &lt;math&gt;r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2 - 2)r^2}, \qquad r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2 - 2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2},\qquad r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2-6)r^2}, \qquad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
*Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above to get ''śara'':
:: &lt;math&gt; \text{sara}=   r\cdot \frac{s^2}{(2^2 - 2)r^2} - \left [ r\cdot \frac{ s^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2} -\left [ r\cdot \frac{ s^2}{(2^2-2)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(4^2-4)r^2}\cdot \frac{s^2}{(6^2-6)r^2}-\cdots\right]\right] &lt;/math&gt;

===Transformation to current notation===

Let ''θ'' be the angle subtended by the arc ''s'' at the centre of the circle. Then ''s'' = ''rθ'' and ''śara'' = ''r''(1 − cos ''θ''). Substituting these in the last expression and simplifying we get
:&lt;math&gt;1 - \cos \theta = \frac{\theta^2}{2!}  -  \frac{\theta^4}{4!} + \frac{\theta^6}{6!} + \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
which gives  the infinite power series expansion of the cosine function.

===Madhava's reformulation for numerical computation===

The last line in the verse &amp;prime;''as collected together in the verse beginning with stena, stri, etc.''&amp;prime; is a reference to a reformulation introduced  by Madhava himself to make the series convenient for easy computations for specified values of the arc and the radius.
As in the case of the sine series, Madhava considers a circle one quarter of which measures 5400 minutes (say ''C'' minutes) and develops a scheme for the easy computations of the ''śara''&amp;prime;s of the various arcs of such a circle. Let ''R'' be the radius of a circle one quarter of which measures C. Then, as in the case of the sine series, Madhava gets
''R'' = 3437&amp;prime;  44&amp;prime;&amp;prime;  48&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;.

Madhava's  expression for ''śara'' corresponding to any arc ''s'' of a circle of radius ''R'' is equivalent to the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{jiva } &amp; = R\cdot \frac{s^2}{R^2(2^2-2)} - R\cdot \frac{s^4}{R^4(2^2-2)(4^2-4)}- \cdots \\
&amp; = \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left[   \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2}{2!} 
- \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left[  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^4}{4!}
 - \left(\frac{s}{C}\right)^2 \left[  \frac{R \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^6}{6!} - \cdots  \right]\right]\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The ''śara'' can now be computed using the following scheme:

:''śara'' = (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (4241&amp;prime;  09&amp;prime;&amp;prime;   00&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus;  (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [ (872&amp;prime; 03&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 05 &amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [  (071&amp;prime; 43&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 24&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[ (03&amp;prime; 09&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 37&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) &amp;minus; (''s'' / ''C'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  [(05&amp;prime;&amp;prime; 12&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) − (s / C)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (06&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;) ] ] ] ] ]

This gives an approximation of ''śara'' by its Taylor polynomial of the 12'th order. This also involves one division, six multiplications and five subtractions only. Madhava prescribes this numerically efficient computational scheme in the following words (translation of verse 2.438 in ''Yukti-dipika''):

''The six stena, strīpiśuna, sugandhinaganud, bhadrāngabhavyāsana, mīnāngonarasimha, unadhanakrtbhureva. Multiply by the square of the arc  divided by the quarter of the circumference and subtract from the next number. (Continue with the result and the next number.) Final result will be [[utkrama-jya]] (R versed sign).''

==Madhava's arctangent series==

===In Madhava's own words===

Madhava's arctangent series is stated in verses 2.206 &amp;ndash; 2.209 in ''Yukti-dipika'' commentary (''Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya'') by [[Sankara Variar]]. A translation of the verses is given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=C.K.

''Now, by just the same argument, the determination of the arc of a desired sine can be (made). That is as follows: The first result is the product of the desired sine and the radius divided by the cosine of the arc. When one has made the square of the sine the multiplier and the square of the cosine the divisor, now a group of results is to be determined from the (previous) results beginning from the first.  When these are divided in order by the odd numbers 1, 3, and so forth, and when one has subtracted the sum of the even(-numbered) results from the sum of the odd (ones), that should be the arc. Here the smaller of the sine and cosine is required to be considered as the desired (sine). Otherwise, there would be no termination of results even if repeatedly (computed).''

''By means of the same argument, the circumference can be computed in another way too. That is as (follows): The first result should by the square root of the square of the diameter multiplied by twelve. From then on, the result should be divided by three (in) each successive (case). When these are divided in order by the odd numbers, beginning with 1, and when one has subtracted the (even) results from the sum of the odd, (that) should be the circumference.''

===Rendering in modern notations===

Let ''s'' be the arc of the desired sine (''[[jya]]'' or ''jiva'') ''y''. Let ''r'' be the radius  and ''x'' be the cosine (''[[kojya|kotijya]]'').

*The first result is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y \cdot r}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Form the multiplier and divisor &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{y^2}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Form the group pf results: 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*These are divided in order by the numbers 1, 3, and so forth:
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}, \qquad \frac{1}{3}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \frac{1}{5}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}, \qquad \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*Sum of odd-numbered  results: 
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1}\frac{y \cdot r}{x} + \frac{1}{5}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*Sum of even-numbered results:  
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{1}{7}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
*The arc is now given by
::&lt;math&gt;s = \left(\frac{1}{1}\frac{y \cdot r}{x} + \frac{1}{5}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2} + \frac{1}{7}\frac{y \cdot r}{x}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}\cdot\frac{y^2}{x^2}+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Transformation to current notation===

Let θ be the angle subtended by the arc ''s'' at the centre of the circle. Then ''s'' = ''r''&amp;theta;,  ''x'' = ''[[kotijya]]'' = ''r'' cos &amp;theta; and ''y'' = ''[[jya]]'' = ''r'' sin θ.
Then ''y'' / ''x'' = tan θ. Substituting these in the last expression and simplifying we get
*&lt;math&gt;\theta = \tan \theta - \frac{\tan^3 \theta}{3} + \frac{\tan^5\theta}{5} - \frac{\tan^7 \theta}{7} + \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;.
Letting tan θ = ''q'' we finally have

*&lt;math&gt; \tan^{-1} q = q - \frac{q^3}{3} + \frac{q^5}{5} - \frac{q^7}{7} +  \quad \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

===Another formula for the circumference of a circle===

The second part of the quoted text specifies another formula for the computation of the circumference ''c'' of a circle having diameter ''d''. This is as follows.

:&lt;math&gt; 
c= \sqrt{12 d^2} - \frac{\sqrt{12 d^2}}{3\cdot 3} + \frac{\sqrt{12 d^2}}{3^2 \cdot 5} - \frac{\sqrt{12 d^2}}{3^3 \cdot 7}+ \quad \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

Since  ''c'' =  &amp;pi; ''d'' this can be reformulated as a formula to compute π as follows.

:&lt;math&gt; 
\pi = \sqrt{12}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{3\cdot3}+\frac{1}{3^2\cdot 5} -\frac{1}{3^3\cdot 7} +\quad \cdots\right) 
&lt;/math&gt;

This is obtained by substituting ''q'' = &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; (therefore ''θ'' = &amp;pi; / 6) in the power series expansion for tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''q'' above.

The competition offers the world’s largest single monetary math prize in a math contest for young women.  In 2017, the First-Place prize was $46,000 (split equally amongst the three-way tie for first) with another $9,000 divided among the remaining finalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2011/math-prize-girls-0920|title=MIT hosts Math Prize for Girls|last1=Chu|first1=Jennifer|website=MIT News|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may win a maximum of $50,000 by participating in the competition over multiple years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xia|first1=Victoria|date=Nov 2013|title=Reckoning with Randomness|url=http://cty.jhu.edu/imagine/docs/MathPrize.pdf|journal=Imagine Magazine|volume=|pages=12–14|accessdate=5 August 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized each year by the [[Advantage Testing Foundation]], the competition is considered to be the preeminent female math competition for young women in North America.&lt;ref name="MITAdmissions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/math_women_rock|title=Math Women Rock|last1=Peterson|first1=Chris|website=MIT Admissions|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/newengland/tag/advantage-testing-foundation/|title=Advantage Testing Foundation|last=|first=|date=September 10, 2013|website=Microsoft New England|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-day annual contest is open to female high-school students in 12th grade or below, from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] who have attained a qualifying score on the [[American Mathematics Competitions]] Exams, specifically the [[AMC 10]] or [[AMC 12]] given in February each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/news/math-news/mit-to-host-math-competition-for-girls|title=MIT to Host Math Competition for Girls|website=Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 300 participants are then selected each year for the competition.  Participants must complete 20 short-answer problems in geometry, algebra, [[trigonometry]], and other math topics in 150 minutes. The exams are then reviewed by a panel of judges, who award cash prizes to the top-scoring participants.&lt;ref name="MITnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2014/math-prize-for-girls-offers-inspiration-mentorship-0923|title=Math Prize for Girls offers inspiration and mentorship to participants on MIT’s campus.|last1=Schroeder|first1=Bendta|website=MIT News|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The competition was founded in 2009 by [[Arun Alagappan]] and Dr. Ravi Boppana in an effort to inspire the next generation of [[female mathematicians]] and create a community of young women who share a passion for math.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/16394|title=Math Prize for Girls Thrives at MIT|last1=Elfman|first1=Lois|website=Diverse Issues in Higher Education|publisher=CMA|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Boppana, the competition’s cofounder and Director, said in a statement that "the Math Prize was created to debunk gender stereotypes, and to support young women who see higher-level mathematics as a pursuit that is challenging, fun, and incredibly rewarding.”&lt;ref name="bostonglobe"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/27/for-girls-rare-chance-flex-math-muscles/WUyteAIjKYvmZXwfxjoWFI/story.html|title=For girls, a rare chance to flex math muscles at MIT|last1=Smith|first1=Jennifer|date=September 27, 2014|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two years of the competition were held at [[NYU]], and since 2011, the competition has been held annually at [[MIT]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MIT President Susan Hockfield applauds 250 High School Women in Math|last1=Liebman|first1=Lydia|accessdate=9 August 2016|publisher=Education Update|issue=Nov/Dec 2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">A '''minimax theorem''' is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the [[max–min inequality]] is also an equality. 
The first theorem in this sense is [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s minimax theorem from 1928, which was considered the starting point of [[game theory]]. 
Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Du|editor1-first=Ding-Zhu|editor2-last=Pardalos|editor2-first=Panos M.|title=Minimax and Applications|date=1995|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781461335573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Felix|last2=Brill|first2=Markus|last3=Suksompong|first3=Warut|year=2016|title=An ordinal minimax theorem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899825615001670|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=95|pages=107–112|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2015.12.010|arxiv=1412.4198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zero-sum Games ==
The minimax theorem was first proven and published in 1928 by [[John von Neumann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Von Neumann |first=J. |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]] |volume=100 |year=1928 |issue= |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/BF01448847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted as saying "''As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games … without that theorem … I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved''".&lt;ref name=Casti&gt;{{cite book
|author=John L Casti
|title=Five golden rules: great theories of 20th-century mathematics – and why they matter
|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-471-00261-5
|publisher=Wiley-Interscience
|location=New York 
|year=1996
|page=19
|isbn=978-0-471-00261-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states:

Let &lt;math&gt;X \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y \subset \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; be [[compact space|compact]] [[Convex set|convex]] sets. If &lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function that is convex-concave, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,y):X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is convex for fixed &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math&gt;f(x,\cdot):Y\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is concave for fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\min_{x\in X}\max_{y\in Y} f(x,y)=\max_{y\in Y}\min_{x\in X}f(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

'''The NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph''' (NinKi:UoPDP)[http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/] was initiated by [[Bangladesh]]i visual artist [[Firoz Mahmud]] ( ফিরোজ মাহমুদ, フィロズ・マハムド ). This is a drawing photograph project to rhetorically rescue popular icons with geometric structure drawings or make photo image of the people tactically static. His pigeonhole or kind of compartmental examples of doodling were engaged on found images in various printed media and also were found in his sketchbook, books, notebooks and often in his borrowed books. The word '[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AB%E3%82%93%E3%81%8D#Japanese Ninki'] (人気) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word which means be Popular or popularity. The Ninki: UoPDP art Project of drawing on photographs consist of numerous archetypal images of popular celebrities in vague appearance. Their career, character, fame, obscurity, activities and character are insurgent and idiosyncratic. Artist Firoz has started on any image and then specifically on Bengal tiger and more significantly on Japanese [[Sumo]] Wrestler as artist based in [[Japan]] and fascinated by sports, media and interested on humorous aspect of entertainment [[industries]].

==About==
The `Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph` (NinKi:UoPDP)[http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/] is [[Firoz Mahmud]]`s one of art projects, started as anonymously. Gradually with the requests of curators and many of his friends, he started to exhibit in public spaces and major art venues. It was initially created for changing the meaning of visual images from the original photo images which Firoz took, collected or found to experiment that how general people react seeing each one's popular icons.

==History==
From the inception when [[Firoz Mahmud]] exposed these drawing photographs, he focused anonymously without using his name at billboards, undergrounds, signage board or in other exhibition venues in Japan. He created this on-going art project in [[Tokyo]] since 2008 as his leisure time drawing doodle on newspapers, magazines, and found images. NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing was first exhibited at the 9th Sharjah Art Biennial in 2009 in Sharjah, UAE. Gradually he exhibited in Museums, galleries and art spaces.Gradually with the requests of curators and many of his friends, he started to exhibit in public spaces and major art venues. One of his first projects of 'Urgency of Proximate Drawing' was exhibited as [http://www.hiroshima-moca.jp/docs/press/dokodemo2011_1.pdf 'Rescued Stardom'] project at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art in Hiroshima Japan where he received a prize.

==Topic of the project and style==
Firoz focuses on celebrities in excited, playful, sporty and happy moments. He draws remarkable lines where they are about to fall or feel hard to gesture in the photographs. Their idolized appearances are highlighted by protective line drawings that display an awareness of the per-formative ethos of iconic expression. The lines underneath the falling position imply that the stardom can`t fall down from the gestures and positions that they are held in.

==Reviews, Comments and Quotes==
The project The NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph [http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/] has been featured in many newspapers and magazines. Many critics, artists and art specialists commented on Firoz's NinKi art project, for example:
`Through a very unique point of view, Firoz focuses on a moment of people’s lives. Although his method is very simple, it reconstructs the space in a very strong way. His works give viewers a lot of excitement. ``- Ozawa Tsuyoshi, Artist based in [[Japan]][http://urgency-of-proximate-drawing-ninki.blogspot.com/]
[[New York City]] &amp; [[Dhaka]] based writer &amp; artist [[Naeem Mohaiemen]] wrote on his reviews in [http://www.departmag.com/index.php/en/detail/177/Firoz-wants-to-fight-Tyson Depart art Magazine] that, -
"Firoz's announced plan is to rescue icons from detritus, but something sinister is at play in these brutalist lines. The crazy cat's cradle across a former pugilist's face, a flesh-eating phantasm in its pre-animation wireframe, is channeling Tyson's unmoored, chaotic, fractured id.[http://www.departmag.com/index.php/en/detail/177/Firoz-wants-to-fight-Tyson]

" Firoz has artfully and humorously explored social and emotive issues through his "NINKi :UoPDP" Urgency of Proximate Drawings. I am surprised how he magically rescued the perturbed stars during their danger situation in the photographs. The drawing structures are drawn with geometric patterns that appear like protective hex symbols. All celebrities can eventually remain invincible in their popularity, protected by an uncanny force."

In [[mathematics]], the word '''null''' (from {{lang-de|null}} meaning "zero", which is from {{lang-la|nullus}} meaning "none")&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite journal |title="null" |journal=[[The Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision March 2004 |url=http://dictionary.oed.com |year=2004 |accessdate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oald"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of "null" adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |journal=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] 9th |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/null |year=2016 |accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; means of or related to having [[Empty set|zero members in a set]] or a value of [[zero]]. Sometimes the symbol '''∅''' is used to distinguish "null" from '''0'''.

In a [[norm (mathematics)|normed]] [[vector space]] the [[null vector]] is the zero vector; in a [[norm (mathematics)|seminormed]] vector space such as [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|Minkowski space]], null vectors are, in general, non-zero. In [[set theory]], the [[empty set|null set]] is the set with zero elements; and in [[measure theory]], a [[null set]] is a set with zero measure.

A [[null space]] of a mapping is the part of the domain that is mapped into the null element of the image (the inverse image of the null element).

In [[statistics]], a [[null hypothesis]] is a proposition presumed true unless statistical evidence indicates otherwise.

'''PCDitch''' is a dynamic aquatic [[ecosystem model]] used to study [[eutrophication]] effects in [[ditch]]es. PCDitch models the nutrient fluxes in the water, the sediment and the vegetation, as well as the competition between different groups of vegetation. PCDitch is used both by scientists and water quality managers{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

==Background==

As a result of [[intensive agriculture]] in [[drainage basin|catchment areas]], many [[polder]] ditches have turned from a clear water state with submerged plant dominance into a state where the water is completely covered with duckweed. Dominance of free-floating plants poses a threat to biodiversity by causing dark an [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions in the water column, and is generally associated with poor ecological quality{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. 

==Application==
PCDitch predicts the existence of a 'critical nutrient load' above which one may expect duckweed coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 1998, A model of ditch vegetation in relation to eutrophication. Water Science &amp; Technology 37: 139-149&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be used by water resource managers to estimate the critical nutrient loading for ditch systems,&lt;ref&gt;Van Liere L, JH Janse &amp; GHP Arts, 2007. Setting critical nutrient values for ditches with the eutrophication model PCDitch. Aquatic Ecology 41: 443–449&lt;/ref&gt; and to evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures such as nutrient loading reductions. A meta-model has also been developed &lt;ref&gt;http://themasites.pbl.nl/modellen/pcditch/&lt;/ref&gt; for use by water managers to derive an estimate of the critical nutrient loading based on only a few key parameters, without any need to run the full dynamic model.&lt;ref&gt;Witteveen+Bos (in Dutch) 2013. Metamodel PCDitch. Witteveen+Bos, rapport nr. STO 170-1. http://edepot.wur.nl/286383&lt;/ref&gt; PCDitch is also used by scientists to investigate the more general effects of eutrophication in ditch ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;Janse, JH &amp; PJTM Van Puijenbroek, 1998. Effects of eutrophication in drainage ditches. Environmental Pollution 102: 547-552&lt;/ref&gt; or to study the competition between different aquatic plant species.

==Model content==
In essence PCDitch is a set of coupled [[ordinary differential equation]]s. With more than 40 [[state variables]] and more than 400 [[parameters]] the model is considered fairly complex{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The model describes a completely mixed water body comprising the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall [[nutrient cycle]]s for nitrogen and phosphorus are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow, [[denitrification]] and burial). Inputs to the model are: water inflow, evaporation, nutrient loading, light intensity, water temperature, sediment characteristics and depth of the ditch. Six functional groups of water plants are modelled: floating-leaved plants, emerged plants, non-rooted floating plants, non-rooted submerged [[flowering plant]]s, rooted submerged flowering plants, [[Charophyta|Charophytes]], and one phytoplankton group.
 
The default configuration of PCDitch does not take spatial heterogeneity into account. However, PCDitch can be coupled with spatial explicit hydrodynamical models to model networks of ditches{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.
Although PCDitch is primarily used for Dutch ditches, the model can be applied to other non-[[stratification (water)|stratifying]] freshwater ecosystems where competition between primary producers is a key determinant of ecosystem functioning, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.
PCDitch was calibrated with data of experimental ditches with sand and clay sediments that were exposed to different nutrient loading treatments{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. As phosphorus in PCDitch is related with aluminium, iron, lutum content (sediment particles smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;µm), [[porosity]] and [[organic matter]] content in de sediment, it is assumed that the model can also be used to describe peat ditches.

==Model development==
PCDitch is the twin-model of [[PCLake]], which is an ecosystem model for shallow lakes. Both models were developed by Dr. Jan H. Janse and colleagues at the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL), formerly part of the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM).&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 2005. Model studies on the eutrophication of shallow lakes and ditches. PhD thesis. Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2009, the model has been jointly owned by PBL and Wageningen University &amp; Research Centre, where further development and application of the model is taking place{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">In [[science]], a '''parameter space''' is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible combinations of values for all the different [[parameter]]s contained in a particular [[mathematical model]]. The ranges of values of the parameters may form the axes of a [[Plot (graphics)|plot]], and particular outcomes of the model may be plotted against these axes to illustrate how different regions of the parameter space produce different types of behaviour in the model.

Often the parameters are inputs of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], in which case the technical term for the parameter space is [[domain of a function]].

Parameter spaces are particularly useful for describing families of [[probability distribution]]s that depend on parameters. More generally in science, the term parameter space is used to describe experimental variables. For example, the concept has been used in the science of [[soccer]] in the article "Parameter space for successful soccer kicks." In the study, "Success rates are determined through the use of four-dimensional parameter space volumes."&lt;ref&gt;Brandon G. Cook &amp; John Eric Goff (2006) [http://stacks.iop.org/EJP/27/865 Parameter Space for Successful Soccer Kicks] [[European Journal of Physics]] 27:865.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[statistics]], parameter spaces form the background for [[parameter estimation]].
As Ross describes in his book:&lt;ref&gt;Gavin J.S. Ross (1990) ''Nonlinear Estimation'', page 94, [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Parameter space is a subset of p-dimensional space consisting of the set of values of &amp;Theta; which are allowable in a particular model. The values may sometimes be constrained, say to the positive quadrant or the unit square, or in case of symmetry, to the triangular region where, say &lt;math&gt;\Theta_1 \le \Theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The idea of intentionally truncating the parameter space has also been advanced elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constance van Eeden|Van Eeden, C.]] (2006)[https://books.google.com/books?id=m-MePzncfyAC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Restricted parameter space estimation problems: admissibility and minimaxity properties''], Springer {{ISBN|0-387-33747-4}} (p. 2)  "Gains in the minimax value can be very substantial when the parameter space is bounded."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* A simple model of health deterioration after developing [[lung cancer]] could include the two parameters gender&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gasperino |first=J. |author2=Rom, W. N. |year=2004 |title=Gender and lung cancer |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525730411701863 |journal=Clinical Lung Cancer |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=353–359 |doi= 10.3816/CLC.2004.n.013|pmid= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smoker/non-smoker, in which case the parameter space is the following set of four possibilities: {{math|{(Male, Smoker), (Male, Non-smoker), (Female, Smoker), (Female, Non-smoker)} }}.
* The [[logistic map]] &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} = r x_n (1-x_n) &lt;/math&gt; has one parameter, ''r'', which can take any positive value. The parameter space is therefore [[positive real numbers]]. 
:For some values of ''r'', this function ends up cycling round a few values, or fixed on one value. These long-term values can be plotted against ''r'' in a [[bifurcation diagram]] to show the different behaviours of the function for different values of ''r''.

* In a [[sine wave]] model &lt;math&gt;y(t) = A \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi),&lt;/math&gt; the parameters are [[amplitude]] ''A'' &gt; 0, [[angular frequency]] ω &gt; 0, and [[phase (waves)|phase]] φ ∈ S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the parameter space is &lt;math&gt;R^+ \times R^+ \times S^1 .&lt;/math&gt;

* In [[complex dynamics]], the parameter space is the [[complex plane]] '''C''' = { ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y'' i : x, y ∈ '''R''' }, where i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1.

:The famous [[Mandelbrot set]] is a [[subset]] of this parameter space, consisting of the points in the complex plane which give a  [[bounded set]] of numbers when a particular [[iterated function]] is repeatedly applied from that starting point. The remaining points, which are not in the set, give an unbounded set of numbers (they tend to infinity) when this function is repeatedly applied from that starting point.

==History==
Parameter space contributed to the liberation of [[geometry]] from the confines of [[three-dimensional space]]. For instance, the parameter space of [[sphere (geometry)|spheres]] in three dimensions, has four dimensions—three for the sphere center and another for the radius.  According to [[Dirk Struik]], it was the book ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'' (1849) by [[Julius Plücker]] that showed
:...geometry need not solely be based on points as basic elements. Lines, planes, circles, spheres can all be used as the elements (''Raumelemente'') on which a geometry can be based. This fertile conception threw new light on both synthetic and algebraic geometry and created new forms of duality. The number of dimensions of a particular form of geometry could now be any positive number, depending on the number of parameters necessary to define the "element".&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}
The requirement for higher dimensions is illustrated by [[Plücker coordinates|Plücker's line geometry]]. Struik writes
:[Plücker's] geometry of lines in three-space could be considered as a four-dimensional geometry, or, as [[Felix Klein|Klein]] has stressed, as the geometry of a four-dimensional [[quadric]] in a five-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|168}}
Thus the [[Klein quadric]] describes the parameters of lines in space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5420">In [[Bayesian inference]], '''plate notation''' is a method of representing variables that repeat in a [[graphical model]].  Instead of drawing each repeated variable individually, a plate or rectangle is used to group variables into a subgraph that repeat together, and a number is drawn on the plate to represent the number of repetitions of the subgraph in the plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech

==Example==
[[Image:Latent Dirichlet allocation.svg|thumb|right|300px|Plate notation for [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]]]]

In this example, we consider [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]], a [[Bayesian network]] that models how documents in a corpus are topically related.  There are two variables not in any plate; ''α'' is the parameter of the uniform [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet]] prior on the per-document topic distributions, and ''β'' is the parameter of the uniform Dirichlet prior on the per-topic word distribution.

The outermost plate represents all the variables related to a specific document, including &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, the topic distribution for document ''i''.  The ''M'' in the corner of the plate indicates that the variables inside are repeated ''M'' times, once for each document.  The inner plate represents the variables associated with each of the &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; words in document ''i'': &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the topic for the ''j''th word in document ''i'', and &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the actual word used.

The ''N'' in the corner represents the repetition of the variables in the inner plate &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; times, once for each word in document ''i''.  The circle representing the individual words is shaded, indicating that each &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is [[observable variable|observable]], and the other circles are empty, indicating that the other variables are [[latent variable]]s.  The directed edges between variables indicate dependencies between the variables: for example, each &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and ''β''.

{{clear}}

==Extensions==
[[File:bayesian-gaussian-mixture-vb.svg|right|300px|thumb|Bayesian [[multivariate normal distribution|multivariate Gaussian]] [[mixture model]] using plate notation.  Smaller squares indicate fixed parameters; larger circles indicate random variables.  Filled-in shapes indicate known values.  The indication [K] means a vector of size ''K''; [D,D] means a matrix of size ''D''&amp;times;''D''; K alone means a [[categorical variable]] with ''K'' outcomes.  The squiggly line coming from ''z'' ending in a crossbar indicates a ''switch'' — the value of this variable selects, for the other incoming variables, which value to use out of the size-''K'' array of possible values.]]

A number of extensions have been created by various authors to express more information than simply the conditional relationships.  However, few of these have become standard.  Perhaps the most commonly used extension is to use rectangles in place of circles to indicate non-random variables—either parameters to be computed, [[hyperparameter]]s given a fixed value (or computed through [[empirical Bayes]]), or variables whose values are computed deterministically from a random variable.

The diagram on the right shows a few more non-standard conventions used in some articles in Wikipedia (e.g. [[variational Bayes]]):
*Variables that are actually [[random vector]]s are indicated by putting the vector size in brackets in the middle of the node.
*Variables that are actually [[random matrices]] are similarly indicated by putting the matrix size in brackets in the middle of the node, with commas separating row size from column size.
*[[Categorical variable]]s are indicated by placing their size (without a bracket) in the middle of the node.
*Categorical variables that act as "switches", and which pick one or more other random variables to condition on from a large set of such variables (e.g. mixture components), are indicated with a special type of arrow containing a squiggly line and ending in a T junction.
*Boldface is consistently used for vector or matrix nodes (but not categorical nodes).

==Software implementation==
Plate notation has been implemented in various [[TeX]]/[[LaTeX]] drawing packages, but also as part of graphical user interfaces to Bayesian statistics programs such as [[Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling|BUGS]] and [[BayesiaLab]].

'''Proof School''' is a school in San Francisco for pupils who love mathematics. The school opened in the fall of 2015 with 45 students in grades 6–10.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Bizjournals.com_July_5_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2014/10/31/stem-education-math-skills-add-up-at-proof-school.html |title=Math skills add up at Proof School – San Francisco Business Times |newspaper=Bizjournals.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, 94.4 students in grades 6–12 are enrolled in Proof School for the academic year (2018–2019).

==Academics==

Proof School is a full-curriculum day school that emphasizes communication, collaboration, and problem solving. The school is accredited by [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].

The school year is divided into 5 'blocks', each of which consist of 6 normal academic weeks and a build week.

Each student has 5 courses: 4 'morning' courses that vary across grades, and a math class. The morning courses meet twice a week: once for 70 minutes, and once for 90 minutes. The math courses meet for two hours and ten minutes every day. 

The (non-post-calculus) math classes focus on a different subject each block: Block 1 is Combinatorics, Block 2 is Algebra, Block 3 is Geometry, Block 4 is Algebra and Pre-Calculus, and Block 5 is Number Theory.

In [[mathematics]], '''''quadrature''''' is a historical term which means the process of determining [[area]]. This term is still used nowadays in the context of [[differential equation]]s, where "solving an equation by quadrature" means expressing its solution in terms of [[antiderivative|integrals]].

Quadrature problems served as one of the main sources of problems in the development of [[calculus]], and introduce important topics in [[mathematical analysis]].

== History ==
[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Antique method to find the [[geometric mean]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood determination of [[area]] of a figure as the process of geometrically constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area  (''squaring''), thus the name ''quadrature'' for this process. The Greek geometers were not always successful (see [[quadrature of the circle]]), but they did carry out quadratures of some figures whose sides were not simply line segments, such as the [[lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Hippocrates]] and  [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|the quadrature of the parabola]]. By Greek tradition, these constructions had to be performed using only a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

For a quadrature of a [[rectangle]] with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side &lt;math&gt;x =\sqrt {ab}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from joining line segments of lengths ''a'' and ''b'', then the height (''BH'' in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection to the point where it crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b''. A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle.

[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;The area of a segment of a parabola is 4/3 that of the area of a certain inscribed triangle.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Problems of quadrature for [[curvilinear]] figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge was proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example a lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of the surface of a sphere and a [[parabola]] segment discovered by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of analysis in antiquity.
:* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to four times the area of the circle formed by a [[great circle]] of this sphere.
:* The area of a segment of a parabola determined by a straight line cutting it is 4/3 the area of a triangle inscribed in this segment.
For the proof of these results, Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]]&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|title=A History of Mathematics: An Introduction|edition= 2nd|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|year=1998|isbn=0321016181}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].

In medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any method. Most often the [[method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous than the geometric constructions of the Greeks, but it was simpler and more powerful. With its help, [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647),&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;{{rp|491}} and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;{{rp|492}}&lt;ref&gt;Enrique A. Gonzales-Velasco (2011) ''Journey through Mathematics'', § 2.4 Hyperbolic Logarithms, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method; he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) some series which are equivalent to what is now called the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of the surface area of some [[Solid of revolution|solids of revolution]].

The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance. With the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term ''quadrature'' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase ''finding the area'' is more commonly used for what is technically the ''computation of a univariate definite integral''.

'''Raymond Clare Archibald''' (7 October 1875 – 26 July 1955) was a prominent Canadian-American mathematician.  He is known for his work as a historian of mathematics, his editorships of mathematical journals and his contributions to the teaching of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stahlman|first=William D.|title=Raymond Claire Archibald (1875--1955)|journal=Isis|year=1956|volume=47|issue=3|pages=244––246|doi=10.1086/348505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Raymond Clare Archibald was born in South Branch, Stewiacke, [[Nova Scotia]] on 7 October 1875. He was the son of Abram Newcomb Archibald (1849—1883) and Mary Mellish Archibald (1849—1901).  He was the fourth cousin twice removed of the famous Canadian-American astronomer and mathematician [[Simon Newcomb]] (1835—1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tatersall|first=James|author2=Shawnee McMurran |title=Raymond Clare Archibald: His Life and Work|journal=Proc. Can. Soc. Hist. Phil. Math.|year=2004|volume=17|pages=241–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald graduated in 1894 from [[Mount Allison University|Mount Allison College]] with B.A. degree in mathematics and teacher's certificate in violin.  After teaching mathematics and violin for a year at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College he went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he received a B.A. 1896 and a M.A. in 1897.  He then traveled to Europe where he attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] during 1898 and received a Ph.D.cum laude from the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]] in 1900.  His advisor was Karl Theodor Reye and title of his dissertation was The [[Cardioid]]e and Some of its Related Curves.

He returned to [[Canada]] in 1900 and taught mathematics and violin at the Mount Allison Ladies’ College until 1907.  After a one-year appointment at Acadia University he accepted an invitation of join the mathematics department at [[Brown University]].  He stayed at Brown for the rest of his career becoming a Professor Emeritus in 1943.  While at Brown he created one of the finest mathematical libraries in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0430|work=From Martha Mitchell’s Encyclopedia Brunoniana|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archibald returned to Mount Allison in 1954 to curate the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library, the library he had founded in 1905 to honor his mother.  At his death the library contained 23,000 volumes, 2,700 records, and 70,000 songs in American and English poetry and drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archibald|first=Raymond|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|url=http://www.mta.ca/libraryhistory/r_c_archibald.html|work=Pages Through The Ages|publisher=Mount Allison University|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Clare Archibald was a world-renowned historian of mathematics with a lifelong concern for the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools.  At the presentation of his portrait to Brown University the head of the mathematics department, Professor [[Clarence Raymond Adams]] (1898–1965) said of him:

"The instincts of the bibliophile were also his from early years.  Possessing a passion for accurate detail, systematic by nature and blessed with a memory that was the marvel of his friends, he gradually acquired a knowledge of mathematical books and their values which has scarcely been equalled.  This knowledge and an untiring energy he dedicated to the upbuilding of the mathematical library at [[Brown University]].  From modest beginnings he has developed this essential equipment of the mathematical investigator to a point where it has no superior, in completeness and in convenience for the user."

==Honors==
Archibald received honorary degrees from the [[University of Padua]] (LL.D., 1922), [[Mount Allison University]] (LL.D., 1923) and from [[Brown University]] (M.A. ad eundem, 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarton|first=George|title=Raymond Clare Archibald|journal=Osiris|year=1956|volume=12|pages=4–34|doi=10.1086/368594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parabolic Segment.svg|thumb|A parabolic segment.]]
'''''The Quadrature of the Parabola''''' ({{lang-el|Τετραγωνισμὸς παραβολῆς}}) is a treatise on [[geometry]], written by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC. Written as a letter to his friend [[Dositheus of Pelusium|Dositheus]], the work presents 24 propositions regarding [[parabola]]s, culminating in a proof that the area of a parabolic segment (the region enclosed by a parabola and a [[line (geometry)|line]]) is 4/3 that of a certain [[inscribe]]d triangle.

The statement of the problem used the [[method of exhaustion]]. [[Archimedes]] may have dissected the area into infinitely many [[triangles]] whose areas form a [[geometric progression]]. He computes the sum of the resulting [[geometric series]], and proves that this is the area of the parabolic segment. This represents the most sophisticated use of the method of exhaustion in ancient mathematics, and remained unsurpassed until the development of [[integral calculus]] in the 17th century, being succeeded by [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]].

== Main theorem ==
[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|Archimedes inscribes a certain triangle into the given parabolic segment.]]
A '''parabolic segment''' is the region bounded by a parabola and line. To find the area of a parabolic segment, Archimedes considers a certain inscribed triangle. The base of this triangle is the given [[chord (geometry)|chord]] of the parabola, and the third vertex is the point on the parabola such that the tangent to the parabola at that point is parallel to the chord. By Proposition 1 (Quadrature of the Parabola), a line from the third vertex drawn parallel to the axis divides the chord into equal segments. The main theorem claims that the area of the parabolic segment is 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle.
&lt;!--
The diagram is misleading: The distances that are equal as a result of the proposition are the chord segments. The fact that the horizontal distances between the parallel vertical lines are also equal is a secondary result not as important.--&gt;

== Structure of the text ==
Archimedes gives two proofs of the main theorem. The first uses abstract [[mechanics]], with Archimedes arguing that the weight of the segment will balance the weight of the triangle when placed on an appropriate [[lever]]. The second, more famous proof uses pure geometry, specifically the [[method of exhaustion]].

Of the twenty-four propositions, the first three are quoted without proof from [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements of Conics'' (a lost work by Euclid on [[conic sections]]). Propositions four and five establish elementary properties of the parabola; propositions six through seventeen give the mechanical proof of the main theorem; and propositions eighteen through twenty-four present the geometric proof.

== Geometric proof ==

=== Dissection of the parabolic segment ===
[[File:Parabolic Segment Dissection.svg|thumb|300px|Archimedes' dissection of a parabolic segment into an arbitrary number of triangles.]]
The main idea of the proof is the dissection of the parabolic segment into infinitely many triangles, as shown in the figure to the right. Each of these triangles is inscribed in its own parabolic segment in the same way that the blue triangle is inscribed in the large segment.

=== Areas of the triangles ===
In propositions eighteen through twenty-one, Archimedes proves that the area of each green triangle is one eighth of the area of the blue triangle. From a modern point of view, this is because the green triangle has half the width and a fourth of the height:&lt;ref&gt;The green triangle has half of the width of blue triangle by construction. The statement about the height follows from the geometric properties of a parabola, and is easy to prove using modern [[analytic geometry]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quadrature Parabola Relative Sizes.svg|center]]

By extension, each of the yellow triangles has one eighth the area of a green triangle, each of the red triangles has one eighth the area of a yellow triangle, and so on. Using the [[method of exhaustion]], it follows that the total area of the parabolic segment is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Area}\;=\;T \,+\, 2\left(\frac{T}{8}\right) \,+\, 4\left(\frac{T}{8^2}\right) \,+\, 8 \left(\frac{T}{8^3}\right) \,+\, \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''T'' represents the area of the large blue triangle, the second term represents the total area of the two green triangles, the third term represents the total area of the four yellow triangles, and so forth. This simplifies to give

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Area}\;=\;\left(1 \,+\, \frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \frac{1}{64} \,+\, \cdots\right)T.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sum of the series ===
[[File:GeometricSquares.svg|thumb|Archimedes' proof that {{nowrap|1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... {{=}} 1/3}}]]
To complete the proof, Archimedes shows that

:&lt;math&gt;1 \,+\, \frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \frac{1}{64} \,+\, \cdots\;=\; \frac{4}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

The formula above is a [[geometric series]]—each successive term is one fourth of the previous term. In modern mathematics, that formula is a special case of the [[geometric series#Sum|sum formula for a geometric series]].

Archimedes evaluates the sum using an entirely geometric method,&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, Archimedes evaluates the [[partial sum]]s of this series, and uses the [[Archimedean property]] to argue that the partial sums become arbitrarily close to 4/3. This is logically equivalent to the modern idea of summing an infinite series.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated in the adjacent picture. This picture shows a unit square which has been dissected into an infinity of smaller squares. Each successive purple square has one fourth the area of the previous square, with the total purple area being the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4} \,+\, \frac{1}{16} \,+\, \frac{1}{64} \,+\, \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

However, the purple squares are congruent to either set of yellow squares, and so cover 1/3 of the area of the unit square. It follows that the series above sums to 4/3.

In mathematics, '''univariate''' refers to an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]], [[equation]], [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[polynomial]] of only one [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. Objects of any of these types involving more than one variable may be called [[wikt:multivariate|multivariate]]. In some cases the distinction between the univariate and multivariate cases is fundamental; for example, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and [[Euclid's algorithm for polynomials]] are fundamental properties of univariate polynomials that cannot be generalized to multivariate polynomials.

The term is commonly used in [[statistics]] to distinguish a [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of one variable from a distribution of several variables, although it can be applied in other ways as well. For example, univariate data are composed of a single [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] component. In [[time series analysis]], the term is applied with a whole time series as the object referred to: thus a [[univariate time series]] refers to the set of values over time of a single quantity. Correspondingly, a "multivariate time series" refers to the changing values over time of several quantities. Thus there is a minor conflict of terminology since the values within a univariate time series may be treated using certain types of [[multivariate statistics|multivariate statistical analyses]] and may be represented using [[Joint distributions|multivariate distributions]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">The '''unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics''' is a phrase that alludes to the article by [[physicist]] [[Eugene Wigner]], "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]". This phrase is meant to suggest that mathematical analysis has not proved as valuable in other fields as it has in [[physics]].

==Life sciences==
[[I. M. Gelfand]], a mathematician who worked in [[biomathematics]] and [[molecular biology]], as well as many other fields in applied mathematics, is quoted as stating,
:Eugene Wigner wrote a famous essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences. He meant physics, of course. There is only one thing which is more unreasonable than the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in physics, and this is the unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alexandre Borovik|Borovik, Alexandre]] |title=Mathematics Under the Microscope |date=November 2006 |url=http://eprints.ma.man.ac.uk/844/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposing view is given by [[Leonard Adleman]], a theoretical computer scientist who pioneered the field of [[DNA computing]]. In Adleman's view, "Sciences reach a point where they become mathematized," starting at the fringes but eventually "the central issues in the field become sufficiently understood that they can be thought about mathematically. It occurred in physics about the time of the Renaissance; it began in chemistry after John Dalton developed atomic theory" and by the 1990s was taking place in biology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/3.08/molecular_pr.html  Gene Genie]&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, "Biology was no longer the science of things that smelled funny in refrigerators (my view from undergraduate days in the 1960s). The field was undergoing a revolution and was rapidly acquiring the depth and power previously associated exclusively with the physical sciences. Biology was now the study of information stored in DNA - strings of four letters: A, T, G, and C..and the transformations that information undergoes in the cell. There was mathematics here!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usc.edu/.../fp-sciam98.pdf Computing with DNA (Scientific American) 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and finance==
{{See also|Financial mathematics#Criticism| Financial economics#Challenges and criticism| Financial Modelers' Manifesto| Physics envy}}

[[Vela Velupillai|K. Vela Velupillai]] wrote of ''The unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in [[economics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velupillai, Vela |title=The unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in economics |journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=849–872 |date=November 2005 |ssrn=904709 |doi=10.1093/cje/bei084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Velupillai, K. Vela |title=The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of Mathematics in Economics |date=2004 |work=Technical Report 6, Economia |publisher=University of Trento |url=http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00000685/}}&lt;/ref&gt; To him "the headlong rush with which economists have equipped themselves with a half-baked knowledge of mathematical traditions has led to an un-natural mathematical economics and a non-numerical economic theory." His argument is built on the claim that

:mathematical economics is unreasonably ineffective. Unreasonable, because the mathematical assumptions are economically unwarranted; ineffective because the mathematical formalisations imply [[non-constructive]] and [[Uncomputable function|uncomputable]] structures. A reasonable and effective mathematisation of economics entails [[Equation#Diophantine equations|Diophantine formalisms]]. These come with natural undecidabilities and uncomputabilities. In the face of this, [the] conjecture [is] that an economics for the future will be freer to explore experimental methodologies underpinned by alternative mathematical structures.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sergio M. Focardi]] and [[Frank J. Fabozzi]], on the other hand, have acknowledged that "economic science is generally considered less viable than the physical sciences" and that "sophisticated mathematical models of the economy have been developed but their accuracy is questionable to the point that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007–08 economic crisis]] is often blamed on an unwarranted faith in faulty mathematical models".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Focardi, S.  |author2=Fabozzi, F.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The reasonable effectiveness of mathematics in economics |journal=American Economist |volume=49|issue=1 |pages= 3–15 |date=Spring 2010| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+reasonable+effectiveness+of+mathematics+in+economics.-a0227362956 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They nevertheless claim that

:the mathematical handling of economics has actually been reasonably successful and that models are not the cause behind the present crisis. The science of economics does not study immutable laws of nature but the complex human artefacts that are our economies and our financial markets, artefacts that are designed to be largely uncertain.... and therefore models can only be moderately accurate. Still, our mathematical models offer a valuable design tool to engineer our economic systems. But the mathematics of economics and finance cannot be that of physics. The mathematics of economics and finance is the mathematics of learning and [[Complex systems|complexity]], similar to the mathematics used in studying biological or ecological systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaneconomist.org/abstracts/2010spring.html#3 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive sciences==
Roberto Poli of [[McGill University]] delivered a number of lectures entitled ''The unreasonable ineffectiveness of mathematics in cognitive sciences'' in 1999. The abstract is:

:My argument is that it is possible to gain better understanding of the "unreasonable effectiveness" of mathematics in study of the physical world only when we have understood the equally "unreasonable ineffectiveness" of mathematics in the cognitive sciences (and, more generally, in all the forms of knowledge that cannot be reduced to knowledge about physical phenomena. Biology, psychology, economics, ethics, and history are all cases in which it has hitherto proved impossible to undertake an intrinsic mathematicization even remotely comparable to the analysis that has been so fruitful in physics.) I will consider some conceptual issues that might prove important for framing the problem of cognitive mathematics (= mathematics for the cognitive sciences), namely the problem of n-dynamics, of identity, of timing, and of the [[specious present]].  The above analyses will be conducted from a partly unusual perspective regarding the problem of the foundations of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Poli seminar abstract |date=1999 |publisher=Category Theory Research Center, McGill University |url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/seminar/poli.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
