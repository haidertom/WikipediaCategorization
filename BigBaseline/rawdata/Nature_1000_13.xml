The assorted ''aether theories'' embody the various conceptions of this "''[[Medium (optics)|medium]]''" and "''[[Substance theory|substance]]''". This [[early modern]] aether has little in common with the [[Aether (classical element)|aether of classical elements]] from which the name was borrowed. Since the development of [[special relativity]], theories using a substantial aether fell out of use in [[modern physics]], and were replaced by more abstract models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Historical models ==

===Luminiferous aether===
{{main|Luminiferous aether|History of special relativity}}

[[Isaac Newton]] suggests the existence of an aether in the Third Book of ''[[Opticks]]'' (1718): "Doth not this aethereal medium in passing out of water, glass, crystal, and other compact and dense bodies in empty spaces, grow denser and denser by degrees, and by that means refract the rays of light not in a point, but by bending them gradually in curve lines? ...Is not this medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun, stars, planets and comets, than in the empty celestial space between them? And in passing from them to great distances, doth it not grow denser and denser perpetually, and thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, and of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer?"&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton The Third Book of Opticks (1718) http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00051&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, luminiferous aether (or ether), meaning light-bearing aether, was a theorized medium for the propagation of light (electromagnetic radiation). However, a series of increasingly complex experiments had been carried out in the late 1800s like the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] in an attempt to detect the motion of Earth through the aether, and had failed to do so. A range of proposed [[Aether drag hypothesis|aether-dragging theories]] could explain the null result but these were more complex, and tended to use arbitrary-looking coefficients and physical assumptions. [[Joseph Larmor]] discussed the aether in terms of a moving magnetic field caused by the acceleration of electrons.

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] said of the aether, "In several parts of this treatise an attempt has been made to explain electromagnetic phenomena by means of mechanical action transmitted from one body to another by means of a medium occupying the space between them. The undulatory theory of light also assumes the existence of a medium. We have now to show that the properties of the electromagnetic medium are identical with those of the luminiferous medium."&lt;ref&gt;James Clerk Maxwell: "[[s: A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism/Part IV/Chapter XX|A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism/Part IV/Chapter XX]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[George Francis FitzGerald]] offered within the framework of [[Lorentz ether theory]] a more elegant solution to how the motion of an absolute aether could be undetectable (length contraction), but if their equations were correct, [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1905 [[special theory of relativity]] could generate the same mathematics without referring to an aether at all. This led most physicists to conclude that this early modern notion of a luminiferous aether was not a useful concept. Einstein however stated that this consideration was too radical and too anticipatory and that his theory of relativity still needed the presence of a medium with certain properties.
&lt;!--Note that  A. Einstein claimed afterwards that “the special theory of relativity does not compel us to deny ether.”  and  “According to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable.”&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. "Ether and the Theory of Relativity".  http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Einstein_ether.html )&lt;/ref&gt; The first step of the new approach&lt;ref&gt;Foigel, AG. (2005). "An interpretation of relativistic mechanics". ''Annalen de la Fondation Louis de Broglie '''''30''': 289-307&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the results concerning the independence of the unidirectional light speed on the velocity of the light source. These results were obtained by W. de Sitter while observing binary stars.&lt;ref&gt;De Sitter, W. (1913). "A proof of the constancy of the velocity of light". ''Proceedings of the Royal  Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences''''' 15'''II, 1297-1298.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

=== Mechanical gravitational aether ===
{{main|Mechanical explanations of gravitation}}
From the 16th until the late 19th century, gravitational phenomena had also been modelled utilizing an aether. The most well-known formulation is [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation]], although other models were proposed by [[Isaac Newton]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Lord Kelvin]]. None of those concepts are considered to be viable by the scientific community today.

== Non-standard interpretations in modern physics ==

=== General relativity ===
{{main|Einstein's views on the aether}}

Einstein sometimes used the word ''aether'' for the gravitational field within [[general relativity]], but this terminology never gained widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kostro, L.|chapter=An outline of the history of Einstein's relativistic ether concept|title=Studies in the history of general relativity |editor=Jean Eisenstaedt |editor2=Anne J. Kox|volume=3|pages=260–280|isbn=978-0-8176-3479-7|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston-Basel-Berlin|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it.&lt;ref name=einstb&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s:Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), republished in ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Quantum vacuum ===
[[Quantum mechanics]] can be used to describe [[spacetime]] as being non-empty at extremely small scales, fluctuating and generating [[pair production|particle pairs]] that appear and disappear incredibly quickly. It has been suggested by some such as [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref name="Dirac, Paul 1951 p. 906"&gt;Dirac, Paul: "Is there an Aether?", Nature 168 (1951), p. 906.&lt;/ref&gt; that this [[quantum vacuum]] may be the equivalent in modern physics of a particulate aether. However, Dirac's aether hypothesis was motivated by his dissatisfaction with [[quantum electrodynamics]], and it never gained support from the mainstream scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Robert B. Laughlin]], Nobel Laureate in Physics, endowed chair in physics, Stanford University, had this to say about ether in contemporary theoretical physics:

{{quote|It is ironic that Einstein's most creative work, the general theory of relativity, should boil down to conceptualizing space as a medium when his original premise [in special relativity] was that no such medium existed [..] The word 'ether' has extremely negative connotations in theoretical physics because of its past association with opposition to relativity. This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum.  . . . Relativity actually says nothing about the existence or nonexistence of matter pervading the universe, only that any such matter must have relativistic symmetry. [..] It turns out that such matter exists. About the time relativity was becoming accepted, studies of radioactivity began showing that the empty vacuum of space had spectroscopic structure similar to that of ordinary quantum solids and fluids. Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness. It is filled with 'stuff' that is normally transparent but can be made visible by hitting it sufficiently hard to knock out a part. The modern concept of the vacuum of space, confirmed every day by experiment, is a relativistic ether. But we do not call it this because it is taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laughlin|first=Robert B.|title=A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down|date=2005|publisher=Basic Books|location=NY, NY|isbn=978-0-465-03828-2|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Pilot waves ===
{{Main|Pilot wave|De Broglie–Bohm theory}}

[[Louis de Broglie]] stated, "Any particle, ever isolated, has to be imagined as in continuous "energetic contact" with a hidden medium."&lt;ref name=deBroglieHiddenMedium&gt;[http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-classiques/aflb124p001.pdf Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie, Volume 12, no.4, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1983FoPh...13..253P |doi=10.1007/BF01889484 |quote=It is shown that one can deduce the de Broglie waves as real collective Markov processes on the top of Dirac's aether|title=Dirac's aether in relativistic quantum mechanics |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=253 |last1=Petroni |first1=Nicola Cufaro |last2=Vigier |first2=Jean Pierre |year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conjectures and proposals ==

According to the philosophical point of view of Einstein, Dirac, Bell, Polyakov, ’t Hooft, Laughlin, de Broglie, Maxwell, Newton and other theorists, there might be a medium with physical properties filling 'empty' space, an aether, enabling the observed physical processes.

[[Albert Einstein]] in 1894 or 1895: "The velocity of a wave is proportional to the square root of the elastic forces which cause [its] propagation, and inversely proportional to the mass of the aether moved by these forces."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein's 'First' Paper (1894 or 1895), http://www.straco.ch/papers/Einstein%20First%20Paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Einstein in 1920: "We may say that according to the general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an Aether. According to the general theory of relativity space without Aether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any space-time intervals in the physical sense. But this Aether may not be thought of as endowed with the quality characteristic of  ponderable media, as consisting of parts which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be applied to it."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s: Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), republished in ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Dirac]] wrote in 1951:&lt;ref name="Dirac, Paul 1951 p. 906"/&gt; "Physical knowledge has advanced much since 1905, notably by the arrival of quantum mechanics, and the situation [about the scientific plausibility of Aether] has again changed. If one examines the question in the light of present-day knowledge, one finds that the Aether is no longer ruled out by relativity, and good reasons can now be advanced for postulating an Aether ... We have now the velocity at all points of space-time, playing a fundamental part in electrodynamics. It is natural to regard it as the velocity of some real physical thing. Thus with the new theory of electrodynamics [vacuum filled with virtual particles] we are rather forced to have an Aether".

[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] in 1986, interviewed by [[Paul Davies]] in "The Ghost in the Atom" has suggested that an Aether theory might help resolve the [[EPR paradox]] by allowing a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] in which signals go faster than light. He suggests [[Lorentz contraction]] is perfectly coherent, not inconsistent with relativity, and could produce an aether theory perfectly consistent with the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]. Bell suggests the aether was wrongly rejected on purely philosophical grounds: "what is unobservable does not exist" [p.&amp;nbsp;49]. Einstein found the non-aether theory simpler and more elegant, but Bell suggests that doesn't rule it out. Besides the arguments based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics, Bell also suggests resurrecting the aether because it is a useful pedagogical device. That is, many problems are solved more easily by imagining the existence of an aether.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Einstein remarked "God does not play dice with the Universe". And those agreeing with him are looking for a classical, deterministic aether theory that would imply quantum-mechanical predictions as a statistical approximation, a [[hidden variable theory]]. In particular, [[Gerard 't Hooft]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Brunetti and A. Zeilinger (Eds.), ''Quantum (Un)speakables'', Springer, Berlin (2002), Ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; conjectured that: "We should not forget that quantum mechanics does not really describe what kind of dynamical phenomena are actually going on, but rather gives us probabilistic results. To me, it seems extremely plausible that any reasonable theory for the dynamics at the Planck scale would lead to processes that are so complicated to describe, that one should expect apparently stochastic fluctuations in any approximation theory describing the effects of all of this at much larger scales. It seems quite reasonable first to try a classical, deterministic theory for the Planck domain. One might speculate then that what we call quantum mechanics today, may be nothing else than an ingenious technique to handle this dynamics statistically." In their paper Blasone, Jizba and Kleinert "have attempted to substantiate the recent proposal of G. ’t Hooft in which quantum theory is viewed as not a complete field theory, but is in fact an emergent phenomenon arising from a deeper level of dynamics. The underlying dynamics are taken to be classical mechanics with singular Lagrangians supplied with an appropriate information loss condition. With plausible assumptions about the actual nature of the constraint dynamics, quantum theory is shown to emerge when the classical Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for constrained dynamics is applied to the classical path integral [...]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = quant-ph/0409021|bibcode = 2005PhRvA..71e2507B|title = Path-integral approach to 't Hooft's derivation of quantum physics from classical physics|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 052507|last1 = Blasone|first1 = Massimo|last2 = Jizba|first2 = Petr|last3 = Kleinert|first3 = Hagen|year = 2005|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.71.052507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis de Broglie]], "If a hidden sub-quantum medium is assumed, knowledge of its nature would seem desirable. It certainly is of quite complex character. It could not serve as a universal reference medium, as this would be contrary to relativity theory."&lt;ref name=deBroglieHiddenMedium /&gt;

In 1982, [[Ioan-Iovitz Popescu]], a [[Romania]]n physicist, wrote that the aether is "a form of existence of the matter, but it differs qualitatively from the common (atomic and molecular) substance or radiation (photons)". The ''fluid aether'' is "governed by the principle of inertia and its presence produces a modification of the space-time geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duursma|first1=Egbert (Ed.)|title=Etherons as predicted by Ioan-Iovitz Popescu in 1982|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1511906371|date=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built upon [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's]] ''ultra-mundane corpuscles'', Popescu's theory posits a finite Universe "filled with some particles of exceedingly small mass, traveling chaotically at speed of light" and material bodies "made up of such particles called ''etherons''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Climont|first1=Jean|title=The Worldwide List of Alternative Theories and Critics. Formerly: The Worldwide List of Dissidents Scientists|publisher=Editions d'Assailly|isbn=978-2902425174|date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid Deutsch, a professor of electrical engineering and bioengineerig, conjectures that a "spherical, spinning" ''aether particle'' must exist in order "to carry electromagnetic waves" and derives its diameter and mass using the [[density]] of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deutsch|first1=Sid|title=Einstein's Greatest Mistake: Abandonment of the Aether|date=2006|chapter=Chapter 9: An Aether Particle (AP)|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] [[Fermi liquid theory|Fermi fluid]] model, "composed primarily of ''electrons and positrons''" that has the consequence of a speed of light decreasing "with time on the scale of the age of the universe" was proposed by Allen Rothwarf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/89ff/2b625440f3a4177060ebd76dcd1e3971bd94.pdf Rothwarf, A., “An Aether Model of the Universe”, 	Physics Essays, vol. 11, issue 3, p. 444 (1998)], Semantic Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Physical cosmology|cosmological extension]] the [[Theory#Philosophical views|model]] was "extended to predict a ''decelerating expansion of the universe''".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0703/0703280.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Ate-u-Tiv''' (sometimes written as  "Ate u Tiv" and less popularly known as "Tsun") is a traditional architectural masterpiece of the [[Tiv people|Tiv People]] of the Middle-belt Region of [[Nigeria]] in [[West Africa]].

The word "Atē" stands for the round, open hut; while "Átē-ŭ-Tiv" attributes it to the [[Tiv people]]. The Ate-u-Tiv  serves as a relaxation and reception point for "vanya" (guests) and allows "mbamaren, ônov man angbianev" (family members) to "tema imiôngo" (chat), sharing ideas and telling stories. The "Orya" (family head) receives guests and attend to family issues (discussions) from the "Ate".

To construct a traditional Ate-u-Tiv, you will require a minimum of six poles called "mtôm" which are y-shaped at the top; these serve as the pillars. The total number of poles required will however depend on the diameter of the Ate to be constructed. These are erected upright into the ground in a circle with equal spacing between poles.  Next is "ukyaver" which comprise stems of slim climbing plants.  These are used in constructing a sort of lintel to hold the roof.

The roof of an "Ate-u-Tiv" comprise "ihyange" (paulins) and "ihila" (grass).  The ihyange are woven together in a cone-shape with ukyaver holding together the rafters.  The completed structure is then hoisted unto the [[Column|pillars]]/[[lintel]] with the coned-top upright. Ihila, having been woven together, is then used to provide a thick-layered roofing. This roof filters incoming air making it cool and clean and at the same time stopping the rains.

The [[Tiv people]] are well known for their hospitality and the "Ate-u-Tiv" is an important component of this hospitality. In order to readily receive visitors, each compound builds an "Ate" which is furnished with chairs made from wood, canes, etc.  In modern days, the components of the "Ate" may vary. Some roofs are now a combination of iron roofing sheets covered by grass that may not necessarily be "ihila"; paulins are regularly made of [[plywood]], etc. The "Ate" design now adorns public places such as hotel gardens, public amusement parks, zoos, museums, etc. New usage of the term "Ate-u-Tiv" may refer to a meeting place, social network or forum.

Like [[Tiv people|Tiv]] [[music]], modernization has not changed Tiv [[architecture]], particularly the design and usage of the "Ate-u-Tiv". Ate-u-Tiv has remained a symbol of Tiv hospitality.

The '''balance of nature''' is a theory that proposes that ecological systems are usually in a stable equilibrium or [[homeostasis]], which is to say that a small change in some particular parameter (the size of a particular population, for example) will be corrected by some [[negative feedback]] that will bring the parameter back to its original "point of balance" with the rest of the system.  It may apply where populations depend on each other, for example in predator/prey systems, or relationships between herbivores and their food source.  It is also sometimes applied to the relationship between the Earth's ecosystem, the composition of the atmosphere, and the world's weather.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] is a balance of nature-based theory that suggests that the Earth and its ecology may act as co-ordinated systems in order to maintain the balance of nature.

The theory that nature is permanently in balance has been largely discredited by scientists working in [[ecology]], as it has been found that chaotic changes in population levels are common, but nevertheless the idea continues to be popular in the general public.&lt;ref name="Zim"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://pus.sagepub.com/content/16/4/393.abstract| title=Ambiguous, circular and polysemous: students' definitions of the "balance of nature" metaphor| journal=Public Understanding of Science| date=October 2007| first=Corinne| last= Zimmerman| volume= 16| number= 4| pages=393–406| doi= 10.1177/0963662505063022| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kricher2009&gt;{{cite book| author=Kricher, John | year=2009 | title=The Balance of Nature: Ecology's Enduring Myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0691138985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later half of the twentieth century the theory was superseded by [[catastrophe theory]] and [[chaos theory]].

==History of the theory==
The concept that nature maintains its condition is of ancient provenance; [[Herodotus]] commented on the wonderful relationship between predator and prey species, which remained in a steady proportion to one another, with predators never excessively consuming their prey populations.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "balance of nature" concept once ruled ecological research, as well as once governing the management of natural resources. This led to a [[doctrine]] popular among some [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s that nature was best left to its own devices, and that [[human]] intervention into it was by definition unacceptable.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/science/new-eye-on-nature-the-real-constant-is-eternal-turmoil.html| title=New Eye on Nature: The Real Constant Is Eternal Turmoil| newspaper=The New York Times| first=William K. |last=Stevens| date=31 July 1990| accessdate=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of a "balance of nature" was already questioned in the early 1900s, but the general abandonment of the theory by scientists working in [[ecology]] only happened in the last quarter of that century when studies showed that it did not match what could be observed among plant and animal populations.&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Heneghan, Liam | url=https://aeon.co/essays/nature-is-out-of-balance-but-it-s-still-worth-saving |title=Out of kilter | publisher=aeon | date=9 October 2012  | accessdate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predator prey interactions==
Predator-prey populations tend to show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior within limits, where the sizes of populations change in a way that may appear random, but is in fact obeying [[Determinism|deterministic]] laws based only on the relationship between a population and its food source illustrated by the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]].  An experimental example of this was shown in an eight-year study on small [[Baltic Sea]] creatures such as [[plankton]], which were isolated from the rest of the ocean. Each member of the [[food web]] was shown to take turns multiplying and declining, even though the scientists kept the outside conditions constant. An article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated; "Advanced mathematical techniques proved the indisputable presence of chaos in this food web ... short-term prediction is possible, but long-term prediction is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Human intervention==
Although some conservationist organizations argue that human activity is incompatible with a balanced ecosystem, there are numerous examples in history showing that several modern day habitats originate from human activity: some of Latin America's rain forests owe their existence to humans planting and transplanting them, while the abundance of grazing animals in the [[Serengeti]] plain of Africa is thought by some ecologists to be partly due to human-set fires that created [[savanna]] habitats.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

Possibly one of the best examples of an ecosystem fundamentally modified by human activity can be observed as a consequence of the Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] practice of "[[Fire-stick farming]]". The legacy of this practice over long periods has resulted in forests being converted to grasslands capable of sustaining larger populations of faunal prey, particularly in the northern and western regions of the continent. So thorough has been the effect of these deliberate regular burnings that many plant and tree species from affected regions have now completely adapted to the annual fire regime in that they require the passage of a fire before their seeds will even germinate. One school in Los Angeles states, " “We have let our kids go to the forest area of the playground. However, five years later, we found that none of the flowers were growing, the natural damp soil had been hardened, and all of the beautiful grass had been plucked,”.

==Continued popularity of the theory==
Despite being discredited among ecologists, the theory is widely held to be true by the general public, with one authority calling it an "enduring myth".&lt;ref name=Kricher2009/&gt; At least in [[Midwestern America]], the "balance of nature" idea was shown to be widely held by both science majors and the general student population.&lt;ref name="Zim" /&gt; In a study at the [[University of Patras]], educational sciences students were asked to reason about the future of ecosystems which suffered human-driven disturbances. Subjects agreed that it was very likely for the ecosystems to fully recover their initial state, referring to either a 'recovery process' which restores the initial 'balance', or specific 'recovery mechanisms' as an ecosystem's inherent characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ergazaki|first=Marida|last2=Ampatzidis|first2=Georgios|date=2012-06-01|title=Students’ Reasoning about the Future of Disturbed or Protected Ecosystems &amp;amp; the Idea of the ‘Balance of Nature’|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|journal=Research in Science Education|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=511–530|doi=10.1007/s11165-011-9208-7|issn=0157-244X|bibcode=2012RScEd..42..511E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 study, Ampatzidis and Ergazaki discuss the learning objectives and design criteria that a learning environment for non-biology major students should meet to support them challenge the "balance of nature" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ampatzidis|first=Georgios|last2=Ergazaki|first2=Marida|date=2017-10-01|title=Toward an “Anti-Balance of Nature” Learning Environment for Non-Biology Major Students: Learning Objectives and Design Criteria|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/nse/abstracts/46/1/170016|journal=Natural Sciences Education|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.4195/nse2017.07.0016|issn=1059-9053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

|}

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

'''Burned area emergency response''' (BAER) is an emergency [[risk management]] reaction to post [[wildfire]] conditions that pose [[risks]] to human life and property or could further destabilize or degrade the burned lands. Even though [[wildfires]] are natural events, the presence of people and man-made structures in and adjacent to the burned area frequently requires continued emergency risk management actions.  High severity wildfires pose a continuing [[flood]], [[debris flow]] and [[mudflow]] risk to people living within and downstream from a burned watershed as well as a potential loss of desirable watershed values.{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;DeBano, L.F., D.G. Neary and P.F. Ffolliott. 1998. ''Fire’s Effects on Ecosystems''. John Willey &amp; Sons, Inc. New York. 331p {{ISBN|0-471-16356-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The burned area emergency response [[risk management]] process begins during or shortly after wildfire containment with risk assessments evaluating the effects of the wildfire against values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} needing protection.  These risk assessments can range from simple to complex. An organized interdisciplinary team of subject matter experts (e.g.,  hydrologists, soil scientists, botanists, cultural resource specialists, engineers, etc.) used among other assessment tools [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924041322/http://www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/agwa/docs/pubs/Goodrich-ASCE-05-AGWA.pdf hydrological modeling] and [http://fire.r9.fws.gov/ifcc/esr/Remote%20Sensing/soil_burnsev_summary_guide042203.pdf soil burn severity mapping] to assess potential flooding and vegetation recovery after the [[Cerro Grande Fire]] in 2000.

A BAER plan is developed based on the risk assessments and burned area land management objectives.  The BAER Plan identifies the most effective treatments to address the identified risks.  Plan implementation timeframes are dictated primarily by anticipated future events (e.g., next significant rainstorm) which also influence treatment options.

== Strategies and treatments ==

Burned area emergency response has mostly concentrated on risk reduction treatments with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;Robichaud, P.R.; Beyers, J.L.; Neary D.G. 2000. Evaluating the Effectiveness of Postfire Rehabilitation Treatments. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-63. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, [[Rocky Mountain Research Station]]. 85 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk avoidance, transfer and retention treatments are integral in the burned area emergency response risk management process.

=== Risk reduction ===

[[Disaster Risk Reduction|Risk reduction]] treatments are designed to protect human life and safety and reduce flood severity, soil erosion and prevent the establishment of non-native plants.  On 10 wildfires studied in Colorado, rainfall amount and intensity followed by bare mineral soil explained 63% of soil erosion variation.&lt;ref&gt;Pietraszek, J.H. 2006. Controls on post-fire erosion at the hillslope scale, Colorado, M.S. Thesis. Colorado State Univ. Ft. Collins Co. 124p.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the risk of flooding, debris flows and mudflows are significantly increased with increasing rainfall intensities and burn severity and that some risk reduction treatments help for low but not high intensity rainfall events.&lt;ref name="Robichaud, P.R. 2006"&gt;Robichaud, P.R.; Elliot, W.J. 2006. Protection from erosion following wildfire. Written for presentation at the 2006 ASABE Annual International Meeting. Sponsored by ASABE, Portland Convention Center, Portland, OR. 9–12 July 2006. ASABE Paper No. 068009. American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.A. and D.A. Martin. 2001a. Hydrologic and Sedimentologic Response of Two Burned Watersheds in Colorado. U. S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 01-4122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mulch]]es, erosion cloth and seeding retard overland flow and protect soil from rain drop impact and increase soil moisture holding capacity. [[Landscape]] structures (e.g., log erosion barriers, contour trenches, straw [[wikt:wattle|wattles]]) trap sediment and prevent slope rilling. Strip tillage and chemicals break up or reduce [[hydrophobic soils]] and improve infiltration.  Wood and straw mulch reduced erosion rates by 60 to 80%, contour-felled log erosion barriers 50 to 70%, [[hydromulch]] 19% and [[post fire seeding]] had little effect the first year when rainfall events were small and intensities low.&lt;ref name="Robichaud, P.R. 2006" /&gt;

In stream flood control treatments slow, delay, redistribute, or redirect water, mud and debris. Straw bale check [[dams]], silt screens and debris [[retention basin]]s slow water flow and trap sediment. Riparian vegetation stabilizes streambanks. Roads and culverts are armored and debris removed as needed. Water diversion implements protect facilities and property.

The chance of introducing new invasive plants to the burned area is reduced by restricting access or thoroughly cleaning all equipment, people and animals of seeds before entering a burned area. Research has shown that non-native plant cover is positively associated with post-wildfire seeded grass cover. Even though post-wildfire seeding operations require seed mix purity standards and the number of contaminated seeds may be small on a percentage based, that the application of very large amounts of seed (thousands of pounds) ensures that a significant number of non-native plant seeds will be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter M.E., P.N. Omi, E.J. Martinson and G.W. Chong. 2006. Establishment of non-native plant species after wildfires: effects of fuel treatment, abiotic and biotic factors, and post-fire grass seeding treatments. International journal of Wildland Fire 15:771-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk avoidance ===

Avoidance treatments remove values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} at risk from risk prone areas. Frequently homes and other values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} are located on [[alluvial fan]]s at the base of watersheds. The presence of the alluvial fans indicates a history of significant flooding, debris flows and mudflows with potential personal and property damage potential. Mobile property is temporally or permanently relocated. [[emergency evacuation|Evacuation]] planning and [[early warning system]]s are frequently used to protect people at risk.  Flood peaks increase more rapidly with increases in rainfall intensity above a threshold value for the maximum 30 min intensity of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mm per hour.  That this rainfall intensity could be used to set threshold limits in rain gauges that are part of an early warning flood system after wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.A. and D.A. Martin. 2001b. Post-fire, rainfall intensity-peak discharge relations for three mountainous watersheds in the western USA. Hydrological Processes, 15(15):2981-2993.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk transfer ===

Often it is not feasible to avoid or reduce risks. [[Flood insurance]] is a means of transferring risk to another party for values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} with insurable value.

=== Risk retention ===

Accepting the risk is an option when values{{Jargon inline|date=August 2017}} at risk are small and inevitable or when the risks cannot be reduced, avoided or transferred (i.e., infrequent catastrophic events).

{{main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by [[William Buckland]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"&gt;{{cite book| author=Buckland, W. |authorlink=William Buckland| year=1841| title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural Theology| publisher=Lea &amp; Blanchard| isbn=1-147-86894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] discussed the then inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"&gt;{{cite book| title=On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection| author=Darwin, C| authorlink=Charles Darwin| year=1859| pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=324&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 202, 306–308]| publisher=Murray| location=London| isbn=1-60206-144-0| oclc=176630493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian [[fauna]], seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

The first discovered Cambrian fossils were [[trilobites]], described by [[Edward Lhuyd]], the curator of [[Oxford Museum]], in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liñán |first1=E.|last2=Gonzalo |first2=R|editor1-last=Rábano |editor1-first=I.|editor2-last=Gozalo|editor2-first=R.|editor3-last=García-Bellido |editor3-first=D.|title=Advances in Trilobite Research|year=2008|publisher=Instituto Geológico y Minero de España |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7840-759-0 |page=240 |chapter=Cryptopalaeontology: Magical descriptions of trilobites about two thousand years before scientific references}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their evolutionary importance was not known, on the basis of their old age, William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record had occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"/&gt; Nineteenth-century geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] used the fossils for dating rock strata, specifically for establishing the [[Cambrian]] and [[Silurian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Mark |title=Fossil Focus: Trilobites |journal=Palaeontology Online |year=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2013/fossil-focus-trilobites/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison, were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others, including [[Charles Lyell]], differed. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] considered this sudden appearance of a solitary group of trilobites, with no apparent antecedents, and absence of other fossils, to be "undoubtedly of the gravest nature" among the difficulties in his theory of natural selection. He reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"/&gt; In the sixth edition of his book, he stressed his problem further as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles R. |title=The origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection |date=1876 |page=286 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.}}

American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], who studied the [[Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale fauna]], proposed that an interval of time, the "Lipalian", was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Charles Doolittle Walcott | title=Cambrian Geology and Paleontology |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume=57 |page=14 |author=Walcott, C.D. |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier fossil evidence has since been found. The earliest claim is that the history of life on earth goes back {{Ma|3850|million years}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Heinrich D. Holland |title=Evidence for life on earth more than 3850 million years ago |journal=Science |author=Holland, Heinrich D |date= January 3, 1997 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.38 |volume=275 |pmid=11536783 |issue=5296 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of that age at [[Warrawoona, Australia]], were claimed to contain fossil [[stromatolite]]s, stubby pillars formed by colonies of [[microorganism]]s.

Rocks dating from {{Ma|580|543}} contain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]], organisms so large that they are likely multicelled, but very unlike any modern organism.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt; In 1948, [[Preston Cloud]] argued that a period of "eruptive" evolution occurred in the Early Cambrian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cloud, P.E. | year=1948 |title=Some problems and patterns of evolution exemplified by fossil invertebrates | journal=Evolution | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=322–350 | doi=10.2307/2405523 | pmid=18122310 | jstor=2405523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as recently as the 1970s, no sign was seen of how the 'relatively' modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late [[Cambrian]] arose.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;

[[File:Opabinia BW2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Opabinia]]'' made the largest single contribution to modern interest in the Cambrian explosion.]]

The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of [[Harry B. Whittington]] and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, reanalysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale and concluded that several were as complex as, but different from, any living animals.&lt;ref name="Whittington1979Lawn"&gt;Whittington, H. B. (1979). Early arthropods, their appendages and relationships. In M. R. House (Ed.), The origin of major invertebrate groups (pp. 253–268). The Systematics Association Special Volume, 12.

Organisms such as the five-eyed ''[[Opabinia]]'' and spiny slug-like ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, seemingly unrelated to anything known today. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s popular 1989 account of this work, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'',&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"&gt;{{cite book| title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History

}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the matter into the public eye and raised questions about what the explosion represented. While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared almost simultaneously in a rather short span of geological period. This view led to the modernization of Darwin's tree of life and the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which [[Niles Eldredge|Eldredge]] and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004EarlySkeletalFossils"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | chapter=Early skeletal fossils

Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwramikStromatoliteDiversityMetazoanAppearance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinWaggoner1997KimberellaMollusc"/&gt;

===Dating the Cambrian===
[[radiometric dating|Radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only recently become available, and for only a few regions.

Relative dating (''A'' was before ''B'') is often assumed sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this, too, has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="DatingProblems"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal| last = Gehling| first = James| last2 = Jensen| first2 = Sören| last3 = Droser| first3 = Mary

Therefore, dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.

===Body fossils===
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by [[erosion]] or [[metamorphism]] before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered. Despite this, they are often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history.&lt;ref name="BentonQualityFossilRecord"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benton MJ |author2=Wills MA |author3=Hitchin R |title=Quality of the fossil record through time |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6769 |pages=534–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10676959 |doi=10.1038/35000558|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..534B }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, biases exist in the fossil record: different environments are more favourable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003ExceptionalFossilPreservation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butterfield, N.J. | year =2003 | title = Exceptional Fossil Preservation and the Cambrian Explosion | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–177 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.166 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | access-date=2008-06-28 | pmid=21680421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although 30-plus phyla of living animals are known, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cowen, R. | title=History of Life | publisher=Blackwell Science | isbn=1-4051-1756-7| year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[Lagerstätte]] are.]]
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of [[lagerstätte]]n, which preserve soft tissues. These allow [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shale]] beds of Chengjiang ([[Yunnan]], [[China]]) and [[Sirius Passet]] ([[Greenland]]);&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1979"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late Cambrian [[Orsten]] ([[Sweden]]) fossil beds.

While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt; In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.

The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[Signor–Lipps effect]].&lt;ref name="Signor1982"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Signor |first1=P.W. |last2=Lipps|first2=J.H. |chapter=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in the fossil record |editor-last=Silver|editor-first=L.T.|editor2-last=Schulz|editor2-first=P.H. |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the earth |id=A 84–25651 10–42|pages=291–296 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0813721903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such changes may reflect a cause of the Cambrian explosion, although they may also have resulted from an increased level of biological activity&amp;nbsp;– a possible result of the explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt; Despite these uncertainties, the geochemical evidence helps by making scientists focus on theories that are consistent with at least one of the likely environmental changes.

===Phylogenetic techniques===
[[Cladistics]] is a technique for working out the "family tree" of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of [[clade]]s&amp;nbsp;– groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.

From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. about how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived &amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A [[phylum]] is the highest level in the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system for classifying organisms]]. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Valentine

}}"&lt;cite&gt;Classifications of organisms in hierarchical systems were in use by the 17th and 18th centuries. Usually, organisms were grouped according to their morphological similarities as perceived by those early workers, and those groups were then grouped according to their similarities, and so on, to form a hierarchy.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}"&lt;cite&gt;Evolutionary biologists often make sense of the conflicting diversity of form&amp;nbsp;– not always does a relationship between internal and external parts. Early in the history of the subject, it became obvious that internal organisations were generally more important to the higher classification of animals than are external shapes. The internal organisation puts general restrictions on how an animal can exchange gases, obtain nutrients, and reproduce.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite their obvious differences, [[spider]]s and [[barnacle]]s both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but [[earthworm]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.  As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification system]] created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jefferies1979OriginOfChordates"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1979 | title=The origin of chordates&amp;nbsp;– a methodological essay | editor=House, M.R. | series=The origin of major invertebrate groups | pages=443–477 | publisher=Academic Press | location=London }} summarised in {{cite journal | author=Budd, G.E. | title=The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=157–165 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/157 | year=2003 | pmid=21680420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem group===
The concept of [[stem group]]s was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups, and have been hypothesized based on this scientific theory. A [[crown group]] is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example [[tardigrade]]s are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.&lt;ref name="CraskeJefferies1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Craske, A.J. | author2=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1989 | title=A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion | journal=Palaeontology | volume=32 | pages=69–99 | url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824010939/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf# | archive-date=2011-08-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal

Groups that cannot easily be placed in an existing phylum are considered to be [[stem group]]s. A stem group annelid, for instance, is any group that was closely related to, but not within, the crown group "annelida". The stem group split off from the lineage that would lead to annelids, and eventually became extinct.

===Triploblastic===
The term ''[[Triploblastic]]'' means consisting of three layers, which are formed in the [[embryo]], quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the [[digestive tract]] (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic&amp;nbsp;– the best-known exceptions are [[Porifera]] (sponges) and [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).

===Bilaterian===
The [[bilateria]]ns are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life histories. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living [[echinoderm]]s ([[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]], etc.) 'look' radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paired gill slits in a fossil with a calcite skeleton | journal=Nature | issue=6891 | pages=841–844 |date=June 2002 | doi=10.1038/nature00805 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6891/abs/nature00805.html |author1=Dominguez, P. |author2=Jacobson, A.G. |author3=Jefferies, R.P.S. | volume=417 | pmid=12075349 | issn=0028-0836 |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, not bilaterian, and not triploblastic.

===Coelomate===
The term ''[[Coelomate]]'' means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, [[annelid]] worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and [[chordate]]s&amp;nbsp;– the noncoelomate [[priapulid]]s are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom&amp;nbsp;– for example [[flatworm]]s, whose organs are surrounded by [[parenchyma|unspecialized tissues]].

==Precambrian life==
Understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&amp;nbsp;– did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?

[[Phylogenetic analysis]] has been used to support the view that during the Cambrian explosion, metazoans (multi-celled animals) evolved [[monophyly|monophyletically]] from a single common ancestor: flagellated colonial [[protists]] similar to modern [[choanoflagellates]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago ===

[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|Modern stromatolites in [[Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve]], Western Australia]]

Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of [[microorganism]]s, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about {{Ma|2700}}, but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about {{Ma|1250}}. This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals"&gt;

Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as [[acritarch]]s. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small [[animal|metazoans]] to resting [[cyst]]s of many different kinds of [[chlorophyta|green algae]]. After appearing around {{Ma|2000}}, acritarchs underwent a boom around {{Ma|1000}}, increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the [[Neoproterozoic]] era also show signs of antipredator defenses.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;

Around the start of the Cambrian (about {{Ma|542}}), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard [[exoskeleton]]s, although they were not necessarily mineralised.&lt;ref name="Jensen2003" /&gt;

Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.{{Citation needed|reason=try Budd|date=June 2008}} They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"/&gt;

This new habit changed the seafloor's geochemistry, and led to decreased oxygen in the ocean and increased CO2-levels in the seas and the atmosphere, resulting in global warming for tens of millions years, and could be responsible for mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/46647-global-warming-animals-cambrian-carbon-dioxide Early Global Warming Was Unexpectedly Caused by a Burst of Tiny Life Forms - Inverse]&lt;/ref&gt; But as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own,&lt;!--this is carefully worded so as not to imply that was neither a part of the Cambrian explosion, or necessarily different from it&amp;nbsp;– please take this into account when rewording!--&gt; for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them&amp;nbsp;– creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, Adolf |author2=Luis A.

If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).

===Beck Spring Dolomite===
Paul Knauth, a geologist at [[Arizona State University]], maintains that photosynthesizing organisms such as algae may have grown over a 750- to 800-million-year-old formation in [[Death Valley]] known as the Beck Spring Dolomite. In the early 1990s, samples from this 1,000-foot thick layer of dolomite revealed that the region housed flourishing mats of photosynthesizing, unicellular life forms which antedated the Cambrian explosion.

Microfossils have been unearthed from holes riddling the otherwise barren surface of the dolomite. These geochemical and microfossil findings support the idea that during the Precambrian period, complex life evolved both in the oceans and on land. Knauth contends that animals may well have had their origins in freshwater lakes and streams, and not in the oceans.

Some 30 years later, a number of studies have documented an abundance of geochemical and microfossil evidence showing that life covered the continents as far back as 2.2 billion years ago. Many paleobiologists now accept the idea that simple life forms existed on land during the Precambrian, but are opposed to the more radical idea that multicellular life thrived on land more than 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-valleys-first-life-came-in-by-land-not-by-sea/ "Scientific American" April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are as hard to classify as most other Ediacaran organisms, they are important in two other ways.

In the lowest Cambrian, the stromatolites were decimated. This allowed animals to begin colonization of warm-water pools with carbonate sedimentation. At first, it was [[anabaritid]]s and ''[[Protohertzina]]'' (the fossilized grasping spines of [[Chaetognatha|chaetognaths]]) fossils. Such mineral skeletons as shells, sclerites, thorns, and plates appeared in uppermost [[Nemakit-Daldynian]]; they were the earliest species of [[halkieria|halkierids]], [[Helcionelloida|gastropods]], [[hyolitha|hyoliths]] and other rare organisms.

==Cambrian life==
=== Trace fossils ===

===Small shelly fauna===
{{Main|Small shelly fauna}}
Fossils known as "[[small shelly fauna]]" have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the [[Nemakit-Daldynian]] and [[Tommotian]] ages; see [[#Timeline|timeline]]). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, [[archeocyathid]]s (sponge-like animals), and small shells very like those of [[brachiopod]]s and snail-like molluscs&amp;nbsp;– but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstätten: a period of time otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.

===Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms===

The fossil record of trilobites began with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.

The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late [[Atdabanian]]; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.&lt;ref name="DornbosBottjer2000Helicoplacoids"&gt;{{cite journal

These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.

===Burgess Shale type faunas===
{{main|Burgess Shale type preservation}}
The Burgess Shale and similar lagerstätten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provide a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft-bodied, hence absent from the rest of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003"&gt;{{cite journal

Because the lagerstätten provide a mode and quality of preservation that is virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, many organisms appear completely different from anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from [[stem group|lineages]] before they established the phyla known today{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&amp;nbsp;– slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.

The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life&amp;nbsp;– perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.&lt;ref name="Xiao2002"&gt;{{cite journal

===Early Cambrian crustaceans===

Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambrian record of crown-group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish [[Orsten]] horizons contain later Cambrian crustaceans, but only organisms smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.

A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the [[Mount Cap formation]], Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage ({{Ma|510|515}}) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;{{PalAss2007|title=The ecology and phylogeny of Cambrian pancrustaceans|author=Harvey, T.P.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"/&gt;

Different authors break the explosion down into stages in different ways.

Ed Landing recognizes three stages: Stage 1, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, corresponds to a diversification of biomineralizing animals and of deep and complex burrows; Stage 2, corresponding to the radiation of molluscs and stem-group [[Brachiopod]]s ([[hyolith]]s and [[tommotiid]]s), which apparently arose in intertidal waters; and Stage 3, seeing the Atdabanian diversification of trilobites in deeper waters, but little change in the intertidal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landing | first1=E. | last2=Kouchinsky | first2=A.

Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a "Tube world", lasting from {{Ma|550|536}}, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a "Sclerite world", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3.&lt;ref name="Budd, G.E. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Budd | first1=G.E. | last2=Jackson | first2=I.S.C. | year=2016 | title=Ecological innovations in the Cambrian and the origins of the crown group phyla | journal=Phil.

Complementary to the shelly fossil record, trace fossils can be divided into five subdivisions: "Flat world" (late Ediacaran), with traces restricted to the sediment surface; Protreozoic III (after Jensen), with increasing complexity; ''pedum'' world, initiated at the base of the Cambrian with the base of the ''T.pedum'' zone (see discussion at [[Cambrian#Dating the Cambrian]]); ''Rusophycus'' world, spanning {{Ma|536|521}} and thus corresponding exactly to the periods of Sclerite World and Brachiopod World under the SSF paradigm; and ''Cruziana'' world, with an obvious correspondence to Trilobite World.

The fossil record as Darwin knew it seemed to suggest that the major metazoan groups appeared in a few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, and even in the 1980s, this still appeared to be the case.&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"/&gt;

However, evidence of Precambrian Metazoa is gradually accumulating.

Some say that the evolutionary change was accelerated by an [[order of magnitude]],{{refn |group=note |As defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;}} but the presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion; not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their [[evolutionary radiation]] ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought. Indeed, statistical analysis shows that the Cambrian explosion was no faster than any of the other radiations in animals' history.{{Refn |group=note |The analysis considered the bioprovinciality of trilobite lineages, as well as their evolutionary rate.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lieberman, B. | year = 2003 | title = Taking the Pulse of the Cambrian Radiation | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 229–237 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.229 | url = http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/229 | pmid = 21680426}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, it does seem that some innovations linked to the explosion&amp;nbsp;– such as resistant armour&amp;nbsp;– only evolved once in the animal lineage; this makes a lengthy Precambrian animal lineage harder to defend.&lt;ref name=Jacobs2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last2 = Wray | last3 = Wedeen | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00077.x | year = 2000 | pages = 340–347 | last4 = Kostriken | last5 = Desalle | pmid=11256378 | last8 = Lindberg | last7 = Gates | last6 = Staton | issue = 6 | volume = 2 | first5 = R. | first4 = R. | first3 = C.

The fossil record is consistent with a Cambrian explosion that was limited to the benthos, with pelagic phyla evolving much later.&lt;ref name=Budd2000/&gt;

Ecological complexity among marine animals increased in the Cambrian, as well later in the Ordovician.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007" /&gt; However, recent research has overthrown the once-popular idea that disparity was exceptionally high throughout the Cambrian, before subsequently decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Erwin, D.H. | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00614.x | title = Disparity: Morphological Pattern And Developmental Context | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, disparity remains relatively low throughout the Cambrian, with modern levels of disparity only attained after the early Ordovician radiation.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007"/&gt;

===The Cambrian explosion as survivorship bias===

[[Graham Budd|Budd]] and Mann&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276-229 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cambrian explosion was the result of a type of [[survivorship bias]] called the "[[Push of the past]]". As groups at their origin tend to go extinct, it follows that any long-lived group would have experienced an unusually rapid rate of diversification early on, creating the illusion of a general speed-up in diversification rates. However, rates of diversification could remain at background levels and still generate this sort of effect in the surviving lineages.

==Possible causes==
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals ([[triploblastic]] [[bilateria]]ns) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain both the timing and magnitude of the explosion.

===Changes in the environment===
====Increase in oxygen levels====
[[Earth's atmosphere#Evolution of Earth's atmosphere|Earth's earliest atmosphere]] contained no free [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schirrmeister|first1=B.E.|last2=deVos|first2=J.M|last3=Antonelli|first3=A.|last4=Bagherri|first4=H.C.|title=Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1791–1796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209927110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1791S|pmid=23319632|pmc=3562814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canfield|first1=D.E.|last2=Poulton|first2=S.W.|last3=Narbonne|first3=G.M.|title=Late-Neoproterozoic Deep-Ocean Oxygenation and the Rise of Animal Life|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|doi=10.1126/science.1135013|pmid=17158290|issue=5808|pages=92–5|bibcode=2007Sci...315...92C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a saturation point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekker|first1=A.|last2=Holland|first2=H.D.|last3=Wang|first3=P.I.|last4=Rumble, III|first4=D.|last5=Stein|first5=H.J.|last6=Hannah|first6=J.L.|last7=Coetzee|first7=L.L.|last8=Beukes|first8=H.J.|title=Dating the rise of atmospheric oxygen|journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=427|issue=6970|pages=117–120|doi=10.1038/nature02260|pmid=14712267|bibcode=2004Natur.427..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general trend, the [[concentration]] of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt;

Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in eukaryotes well before the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parfrey|first1=L.W.|last2=Lahr|first2=D.J.G.|last3=Knoll|first3=A.H.|last4=Katz|first4=L.A.|title=Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks|journal=PNAS|date=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13624–13629|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110633108|pmid=21810989|pmc=3158185|bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813624P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around 800 million years ago, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Before the spike in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with mitochondrial function in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to drive metabolism. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

====Ozone formation====

In the late [[Neoproterozoic]] (extending into the early [[Ediacaran]] period), the Earth suffered [[Snowball Earth|massive glaciations]] in which most of its surface was covered by ice.

Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/novel-evolutionary-theory-for-the-explosion-of-life/ Novel Evolutionary Theory For The Explosion Of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's [[Great Unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = S.

An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the [[East African Orogeny|Transgondwanan Supermountain]] that existed at the time the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day [[East Africa]] as an [[orogeny|orogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Developmental explanations===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor [[Evolutionary developmental biology|modifications to animals' development]] as they grow from [[embryo]] to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The [[Hox gene]]s, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain ''Hox'' gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; combines with molecular data&lt;ref name="deRosa1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Rosa, R. |author2=Grenier, J.K. |author3=Andreeva, T. |author4=Cook, C.E. |author5=Adoutte, A. |author6=Akam, M. |author7=Carroll, S.B. |author8=Balavoine, G. |date=June 1999 | doi = 10.1038/21631 | journal = Nature | volume = 399 |title=Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids and protostome evolution | pmid = 10391241  | issue = 6738 | issn = 0028-0836 | pages = 772–6|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..772D }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the [[physics]] of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, S.A.  |author2=Bhat, R. |date=April 2008 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015008| journal = Physical Biology | volume = 5 | page = 0150580|title=Dynamical patterning modules: physico-genetic determinants of morphological development and evolution | pmid = 18403826  | issue = 1 | issn = 1478-3967|bibcode = 2008PhBio...5a5008N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horizontal gene transfer]] has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Macis|first2=Luciana|last3=Reitner|first3=Joachim|last4=Wörheide|first4=Gert|title=A horizontal gene transfer supported the evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization strategy|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=12 August 2011|volume=11|page=238|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-238|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/238|access-date=10 September 2014|pmid=21838889|pmc=3163562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanations===
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the [[food chain]]; some suggest [[Evolutionary arms race|arms races]] between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of [[coevolution]]. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====End-Ediacaran mass extinction====
{{main|End-Ediacaran extinction}}
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as ''Cloudina'', and the accompanying perturbation in the {{d13c|link}} record.

Mass extinctions are often followed by [[adaptive radiation]]s as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt;

====Evolution of eyes====
{{main|Evolution of the eye}}
[[Andrew Parker (zoologist)|Andrew Parker]] has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs&amp;nbsp;– smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Parker, Andrew | title=In the Blink of an Eye |publisher= Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | isbn=0-7382-0607-5 | oclc=52074044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McCall2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCall | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.08.004 | title = The Vendian (Ediacaran) in the geological record: Enigmas in geology's prelude to the Cambrian explosion | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 77 | pages = 1–229 |bibcode = 2006ESRv...77....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====Arms races between predators and prey====
The ability to avoid or recover from [[predation]] often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of [[natural selection]]. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.&lt;ref name="DawkinsKrebs1979ArmsRaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Arms races between and within species| volume=205| issue=1161| pages=489–511| date=September 21, 1979| jstor=77442 |author1=Dawkins, R. |author2=Krebs, R.J.| doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081
| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| pmid=42057| bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in ''Cloudina'' shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the ''appearance'' of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |author=McMenamin, M. A.

Thus the role of predators as triggerers of diversification may have been limited to the very beginning of the "Cambrian explosion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals====
[[Geochemical]] evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of [[plankton]] has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their [[drag (physics)|drag]] was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by [[scavenger]]s or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens [[Filter feeder|filtered]] microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some [[carbon]] out of [[Carbon cycle|circulation]], resulting in an increase in the [[concentration]] of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily [[Chemical compound|combines]] with oxygen).&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt;

The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001ECR"&gt;{{Cite book

Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt; This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;

===Ecosystem engineering===
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The [[Devonian]] [[Colonization of the land|colonization of land]] had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the [[Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]]. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.&lt;ref name="Erwin2011a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

===Complexity threshold===
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.&lt;ref name="SoléFernándezKauffman2003AdaptiveWalks"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic threshold may have a correlation to the amount of oxygen available to organisms. Using oxygen for metabolism produces much more energy than anaerobic processes. Organisms that use more oxygen have the opportunity to produce more complex proteins, providing a template for further evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These proteins translate into larger, more complex structures that allow organisms better to adapt to their environments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperling|first1=E.A.|last2=Frieder|first2=C.A.|last3=Raman|first3=A.V.|last4=Girguis|first4=P.R.|last5=Levin|first5=L.A.|last6=Knoll|first6=A.H.|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=33|pages=13446–13451|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110|pmid=23898193|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S|pmc=3746845}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of oxygen, genes that code for these proteins could contribute to the expression of [[complex traits]] more efficiently. Access to a wider range of structures and functions would allow organisms to evolve in different directions, increasing the number of niches that could be inhabited. Furthermore, organisms had the opportunity to become more specialized in their own niches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Uniqueness of the explosion==
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a [[coevolution]]ary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| year = 2007| title = Macroevolution and macroecology through deep time| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| issue = 1| pages = 41–55| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan [[clade]]s of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiations]], such as those of [[fish]] in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, involved fewer [[taxon|taxa]], mainly with very similar body plans.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Although the recovery from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic extinction]] started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D.H. |author2=Valentine, J.W. |author3=Sepkoski, J.J. |date=November 1987| title=A Comparative Study of Diversification Events: The Early Paleozoic Versus the Mesozoic |journal=Evolution |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1186 |doi=10.2307/2409086 |pmid=11542112|jstor=2409086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable [[ecological niche]]s. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and [[wikt:incumbent|incumbent]]s usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different [[phylum|phyla]]; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.&lt;ref name="Valentine1995WhyNoNewPhyla"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why No New Phyla after the Cambrian?

There were two similar explosions in the [[Evolutionary history of plants#Colonisation of land|evolution of land plants]]: after a cryptic history beginning about {{Ma|450}}, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Furthermore, Angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumbnail|right|236px|Earth]]

An overwhelming majority of fiction is set on or features the [[Earth]].  However, authors of [[speculative fiction]] novels and writers and directors of [[science fiction film]] deal with Earth quite differently from authors of conventional fiction.  Unbound from the same ties that bind authors of traditional fiction to the Earth, they can either completely ignore the Earth or use it as but one of many settings in a more complicated universe, exploring a number of common themes through examining outsiders' perceptions of and interactions with Earth.

==Common themes==
{{Prose|date=October 2009}}
*'''Center of the Universe, or the Seat of Power in an [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|Intergalactic]] community'''
**Earth is often depicted as a major power-broker in the community due to [[anthropocentrism]]. Perhaps the most notable example of this is ''[[Star Trek]]'' (where Earth is the capital of the [[United Federation of Planets]]).
**Earth can also be depicted as the head of an empire as in [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[Dominic Flandry]]'' series where "The barbarians in the long ships waited at the edge of the Galaxy for the ancient [[Terran Empire]] to fall … The brilliant Starship Commander Flandry fought to save the empire even as he scorned it" (from the preface to ''The Rebel Worlds'').
**[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Darkover]]'' series, too, has a brooding Terran Empire maintaining a colonial enclave on the planet Darkover where the plot takes place, and on countless others.
**''[[Haegemonia: Legions of Iron]]'' also features an empire controlled from Earth with other major planets, such as Eden IV.
**It is a common theme across British science fiction to have Earth near the core, or center of the fictional universe{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, common examples could be the works of [[Peter F. Hamilton]] where earth is the main terminus of the wormhole and the capital of the inner worlds (in later works he turns the idea that people seek an inner [[Human migration|migration]] (as opposed to an external expansion) to [[frontier]] type worlds).
**In the [[BBC]] science fiction show ''[[Doctor Who]]'', many episodes set in the future depict Earth as being the head of an empire that stretches across many galaxies.
** In the [[Warhammer 40,000]] franchise, Earth is referred to as "Holy Terra" and is the capital of the Imperium of Man
*'''Invasion by [[alien invasion|Aliens]].'''
{{See also|:Category:Alien invasions in fiction}}
:*While reasons vary, in most stories, it is because extraterrestrials are looking for a new world to colonize or otherwise dominate. The aliens are often used to portray nearly all-powerful beings, placing the strongest forces on Earth at the receiving end of attacks that they can barely understand. This theme is one of the earliest in science fiction, demonstrated by [[H. G. Wells]] in ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and Doctor Who, where the invasions in the 1960s, 70s and the 80s are small scale, and the invasions from the 1990s and later are more-large scale, in works such as ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. In such scenarios, the author often uses [[deus ex machina]] to allow the invasion to be repulsed. In others, like ''[[Footfall]]'' and ''[[Worldwar]]'', the author depicts aliens only slightly more advanced than the inhabitants of Earth, and are fought to a stand-still or defeated in battle. The opposite has also been depicted, with Earth becoming a refuge to aliens as seen in the ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' series of movies, and ''[[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|Alien Nation]]'' series.
*'''Forgotten or mythical'''
**The memory of Earth, and its location may be lost to the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]] or shrouded in myth as mankind abandons the Earth. [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' and ''[[Galactic Empire (series)|Empire]]'' series depict a common theme of a destroyed Earth. In other works, such as ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', it is largely forgotten except by the religious. In the numerous books of the [[Dumarest saga|''Dumarest'' saga]] by [[E.C. Tubb]], the adventurer protagonist was born on a "galactic backwater" Earth and at a young age had stowed away on a rare spaceship touching down on the planet; having seen more than enough of the galaxy he wants to go back, but no one else had ever heard of the planet. The first Terran inhabitants of the Koprulu Sector are Earth-born criminals in [[sleeper ship]]s in ''[[StarCraft]]''. The expansion also mentions about Earth: upon hearing of the United Earth Directorate's forces' arrival, Zeratul remarks "Raynor [a [[wikt:Terran#Adjective|Terran]] captain] spoke to me of the distant Terran homeworld of Earth." This implies that the Terrans still know about Earth but its location is lost (''StarCraft'' manual mentions that the sleeper ships have become lost in hyperspace when an error erased the intended destination's coordinates, as well as those of Earth's, resulting in the ships going at full speed for several decades until the engines broke down). Also, the Terran Confederacy uses the same flag as the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War]]. Also, in the [http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html Zodiac] series by Romina Russell, it states that "history tells us the original human colonizers came from a distant and long-gone planet called Earth, and they traveled through a portal in Helios to get here—but the portal is just another myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zodiacbooks.com/beginnings.html|title=Zodiac Beginnings|last=Russell|first=Romina|date=14 February 2017|website=Zodiac Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Destruction'''
{{See also|:Category:Apocalyptic fiction}}
:*Earth could have been completely destroyed or rendered uninhabitable, but its location (or at least its former location) is well known. This last scenario is also popular, and was featured in the movie ''[[Titan A.E.]]'', as well as in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. There is an example of a devastated uninhabitable Earth in [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1973 novel ''[[To Die in Italbar]]''.
*'''Not mentioned'''
**Some works, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' series and many [[fantasy]] works, never mention the Earth at all (although a proposed novel, [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s ''[[Alien Exodus]]'', would have linked Earth to the ''Star Wars'' universe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfwriter.com/alienout.htm George Lucas's ''Monsters and Aliens'', Volume 1: ''Alien Exodus'' — Outline by Robert J. Sawyer]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In some ''Star Wars'' works, Earth (also known as Urthha) exist, such as the ''Star Wars''-''[[Indiana Jones]]'' non-canonical comic strip ''Into the Great Unknown'' (published in ''[[Star Wars Tales]]'' #19), in the also non-canonical Disney's ''[[Star Tours|Star Tours: The Adventure Continue]]'' ride, in other two non-canonical works, and in ''Monsters and Aliens from George Lucas''.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the author to operate in a realm unfamiliar and otherworldly to the reader or to explore contentious issues and historical themes in an otherwise entirely alien environment, giving the work a radically different perspective. In the ''[[Homeworld]]'' games for example, Earth's existence is unknown – and indeed entirely immaterial – as the games take place in a different galaxy altogether (specifically the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]]). However, judging by the appearance of members of the Kushan/Hiigaran people, most notably Karan S'jet, Hiigaran biology is at least outwardly similar, if not identical, to human biology.

==Earth as presented in various works==
* In the [[H. G. Wells]] story ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', perhaps the first depiction of an alien invasion in fiction, Earth is simply a neighboring planet of the inhabitants of Mars. With their world coming into its end, they target the younger and richer Earth for migration. This plot is repeated with varying degrees of differences in many of its adaptations, but Earth's place largely remains the same. The notable exception is in the television series ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'', where the aliens look to Earth for more specific reasons, as it features many of their old world's characteristics (such as both being the third planet in their respective systems, the number 3 playing a large role in their beliefs).
* ''[[Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare]]'' - ''[[Earth]]'' is the home to the UNSA (United Nations Space Alliance) and Earth is attacked by the Settlement Defense Front, resulting in Earth's defenses compromised.
* In the [[anime]] series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', Earth has become a backwater wasteland after a horrific accident caused one of the jumpgates that humans used to travel the Solar System to explode, destroying part of the Moon and causing the destroyed bits to rain down on the Earth.
* The ''[[Gundam]]'' anime often depicts a war between Earth against the [[space colonization|space colonies]] established by humans in [[outer space]].
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'', Earth (known as [[Thulcandra]]) is part of the [[Field of Arbol]]: and is the subject of an interplanetary [[blockade]] — hence its name, the Silent Planet.
* In ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', [[Tuxedo Mask]] protects Earth and holds the Golden Crystal.
* In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', Earth has been united into a single geopolitical entity, [[The World State]].
* In [[David Weber]]'s ''[[Honorverse]]'', Earth is the capital planet of the [[Solarian League]], the largest and wealthiest political institution ever created by man. Prior to the League's creation, a large portion of humanity departed for other planets and solar systems in what came to be known as the [[Diaspora]], leaving those who remained to rebuild from the effects of pollution, resource exhaustion, and the cataclysmic Final War. They did so, and Earth once again became the political, economic, and cultural center of humanity.
* The Earth also plays a major part in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' universe. It is where humans come from and expand out of to create numerous Empires, being invaded by many different aliens through all of its history. Having a weather control station on the moon by 2070, by the year 200,000, the Earth is in the middle of the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. By the year 5,000,000,000, humanity is spread all across the stars and has fully integrated themselves with the rest of the universe. Shortly after the destruction of Earth, Humanity regroups and colonized a new planet, naming it New Earth. Humans go to live on to the end of the Universe.
* In ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' Earth, known as Terra ([[Latin]] for Earth), is the home world of Humanity and the capital of the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperium of Man]]. By the 41st Millennium, it has become an [[ecumenopolis]]. It is the site of the Golden Throne, where the God-Emperor resides. Its soil is utterly barren and its atmosphere is a fog of pollution. Massive, labyrinthine edifices sprawl across the vast majority of the surface. Its oceans have long ago boiled away. Many mountain ranges have been leveled, perhaps all but the Himalayas, due to the laboratories said to be underneath and the Astronomican that lays within them. Beneath hundreds of layers of urban accretion, catacombs hold older cultures, completely different from the surface ones. A poor civilization lives and dies, without ever seeing the surface. A square meter of land on Terra costs more than a palace on any Hive World; only the most wealthy can even afford to own a small section of land.
* In the [[Noon Universe]], [[Earth (Noon Universe)|Earth]] is a Utopian world of immense power and the initial home planet of all [[humans (Noon Universe)|humans]] scattered over the Universe.
* In the alternate future universe of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'', Earth has been divided into two twin worlds — technology-driven [[Stark (The Longest Journey)|Stark]], the world as we know it, and the magic world of [[Arcadia (The Longest Journey)|Arcadia]] for over 13 millennia.
* In [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World'', [[The Stainless Steel Rat]] travels to Earth, 1975, and then to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] France, to stop a madman known as He from destroying the timeline.  The Rat and his contemporaries in the series show confusion over the name of the world, hedging by calling it either "Earth" or "Dirt".
* In the animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'', Earth is the center of the Homeworlds, the core of both Human and Neosapien Empires (at different times).
* In the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' film series, Earth is still the main home of humanity even though humans have begun to colonise other worlds. It is also the HQ of the ruthless [[megacorp]]oration "[[Weyland-Yutani]]". Nothing is seen of the planet itself in the primary four ''Alien'' films, with the exception of shots of the planet from orbit, and some shots of Paris in the special edition of ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' which depicts the city as a ruined, possibly post-holocaust landscape. By the time of ''Resurrection'', which is set in the 24th century, Earth as a whole is considered to be an unpleasant, polluted planet that even hardened mercenaries prefer to avoid. Upon learning of their impending arrival there, Johner (one of the film's character portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]]) remarks "Earth, man...what a shithole."
* The television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' differs from the usual portrayal of Earth as a dominant power in galactic civilization. The series' [[Systems Commonwealth]] was founded thousands of years in the past by the [[Vedran]] species in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], with Earth joining in the 22nd century. Humans go on to become a major player in the Commonwealth, but Earth itself has no special importance (although the final two episodes of the series [[retcon]] this). Following the fall of the Commonwealth, Earth becomes one of many [[Nietzschean (Andromeda)|Nietzschean]] slave worlds. Earth was eventually liberated, but the [[Spirit of the Abyss]] destroyed the planet.
* In the video game universe of ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'', Earth is the center of all human government, military and technology. Earth and its colonies are governed by the UNSC, or the [[United Nations Space Command]]. During the Human–Covenant War, the Cole Protocol was implemented, stating that ships must self-destruct rather than let the Covenant find the location of Earth. Furthermore, any ship heading to Earth must take several random slipspace jumps rather than head straight for it. On October 20, 2552, Earth was attacked by the Covenant and successfully defended by the UNSC Military after a month-long battle.
* In the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series, Earth is ruled by a [[fascism|fascistic]] government called the [[United Earth Directorate]]. When the UED becomes aware of the presence of aliens hostile to humanity in the far away Koprulu Sector, it sends a large [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] to defeat the aliens, conquer the sector, and reintegrate the banished [[Terran (StarCraft)|human colonists]] who reside there into its political fold. The Directorate's initial progress in the sector was promising, as it managed to invade and conquer the main planets of both the [[Terran Dominion]] and the bizarre alien [[Zerg]], in the process kidnapping the [[Zerg Overmind]] and using it to control most of the Zerg swarms. The rogue Zerg leader [[Sarah Kerrigan|Kerrigan]] waged a clever and highly successful war to rid the sector of the Earth's control, aided in part by temporary Terran and Protoss allies. The end result for Earth's forces was a crushing defeat which amounted to the loss of all ships in the Koprulu Sector. As of the events of ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]'', there remain a few isolated pockets of UED fleet survivors scattered throughout the Koprulu sector. It is unclear if the UED is planning to return to the war-torn area.
* In author [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'', Earth is the heart of an economical empire, its biosphere wrecked by global warming to such an extent that any unfortified structure would be torn apart in a matter of days by colossal, super-sized versions of modern tropical hurricanes. The entire sprawling human population is forced to live in arcologies protected against the so-called "Armada Storms". Whilst Earth represents a significant political and industrial power base, it is nonetheless an independent state and not the head of the series' [[Confederation]]. Physically, Earth is dominated by massive Arcologies that cover most of the major urban centers of our time, including London, New York and [[Johannesburg]]. There are also several equatorial [[space elevator]]s that allow for transit into orbit, where the planet is surrounded by an ''[[Gerard K. O'Neill|O'Neill]] Halo'', a collection of captured asteroids providing habitation and raw materials as well as docking and strategic defense units. Earth is sometimes referred to as "The fortress world" due to the enormous fleet of space warship's surrounding it in order to protect the vital industrial facilities of the ''O'Neill Halo''.
* In the [[Metroid (series)|''Metroid'' series]], Samus's birthplace K-2L was a colony of Earth.  However at the formation of the Galactic Federation, in the year 2000 C.C. (Cosmic Calendar), it can be assumed that Earth's resources were absorbed into the federation.
* In the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' universe, Earth is the capital of the [[Terran Confederation (Wing Commander)|Terran Confederation]], which spends much of the time period covered in the published media (from the middle to the end of the 27th century) locked in an interstellar war with the [[Kilrathi Empire]]. The Confederation was founded in the aftermath of the collapse of the World Economic Consortium.
* In the ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' series, Earth is much as in the real world until Rhodan, that Earth's first man on the moon, discovers a wrecked starship from the ancient Arkonide Empire. Using the technology and the help of the surviving Arkonides, Rhodan forces the Earth to unite under his leadership, and begins to explore the galaxy while carefully concealing the location of Earth from enemies such as the Arkonide Empire. Later in the series, Earth under the now-immortal Rhodan becomes a major player in the universe, establishing a benevolent empire. During an invasion of the Milkyway by the ''Laren'', Earth and the Moon with its 20 billion inhabitants are supposed to be teleported to a different system, but accidentally end up in the bridge between two collided galaxies (called ''Maelstrom of Stars'') and moved into orbit about a star. 120 years later the system falls into a giant energy vortex and is again transported to another galaxy, and most of the humans in it become part of the ''superintelligence IT''. Another five years later, IT transports Earth and Moon back into the Solar System, and they are repopulated.
* In the anime and manga series ''[[Trigun]]'' it is revealed that through constant pollution and humanity living beyond its means that the Earth had to be evacuated after becoming uninhabitable. The humans fled in cryogenic suspension with only a small skeleton crew operating their fleet called Project Seeds to search for a new homeworld. Upon crashing on the planet Gunsmoke, any advanced technology from the days of Earth is referred to as lost technology.
* In Phillip Reeves's ''[[Mortal Engines Quartet]]'' (known as the ''Hungry City Chronicles'' in the US), Earth has been ravaged by a conflict known as the Sixty Minute War, which was soon followed by earthquakes, volcano eruptions and a brief ice age, leaving Earth forever changed. Europe is known as the "Great Hunting Ground" as where most [[Traction Cities]] are found, North America is known as the "Dead Continent" and South America's [[isthmus]] has been cut off due to 'Slow Bombs'.
* In Dan Simmons's ''[[Hyperion Cantos]]'' series, Old Earth is believed to have been destroyed by ''The Big Mistake of '08'' (in which a miniature black hole was dropped into it), but later shown to have been spirited away by 'other' beings of godlike abilities and consciousness.
* In the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' film, astronauts attempt to leave the [[Solar System]] for the first time, aiming for [[Alpha Centauri]]. However, unexplained phenomena cause their small vessel to change course while the crew is in [[cryopreservation|cryostasis]]. They wake upon landing on an inhabitable but harsh planet that they later learn is a future Earth, dominated by sapient [[ape]]s. However, in the original [[Pierre Boulle]] novel and the [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|2001 film]], both of the same name, the astronauts find civilizations of apes on another planet, but suffer a rude shock upon returning to Earth, finding it besieged by apes.
* In the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' series of [[first-person shooter]]s, a modern-day research facility opens a portal storm between Earth and the border world Xen. The portal storm floods the planet with aliens from that world, and is kept open by a creature named [[Nihilanth]]. A scientist named [[Gordon Freeman]] manages to reach the creature and take it down, unknowingly freeing one of the races that traveled to Earth by the portal storms. The portal storm awakes the Combine Empire, which then manages to conquer Earth in just seven hours, after its military had been crippled by beings from Xen. Two decades after the Black Mesa incident, Gordon Freeman succeeds in cutting Earth off of the Combine Empire and a device that suppressed human reproduction, leading to a renewed fight between the native population and the trapped Combine forces.
* In the [[massively multiplayer online game]] ''[[Tabula Rasa (video game)|Tabula Rasa]]'', Earth is shown in the near future as having been attacked by a force known as the Bane. Hopelessly outmatched, it is revealed that Earth's various governments haven't been caught completely off guard and rather than mount a suicidal defense, have chosen to abandon the planet using wormhole portals built using alien technology to evacuate as many people as they could to other planets so the human race can regroup and launch a counterattack at the Bane. The ultimate fate of Earth, and those that were left behind, was unknown, with many thinking it was lost forever. It was later discovered Earth had been conquered and converted into a large staging area for the Bane which left the planet in bad shape.
* In the video game ''[[Xenosaga]]'', the Earth has been abandoned by humanity for at least 4,000 years, because the Earth has disappeared altogether from physical space. Humans refer to the planet as "Lost Jerusalem".
* In the video game ''[[FreeSpace]]'' Earth serves as the capital of the Galactic Terran Alliance. During the war against the Shivans, a last-ditch attack in subspace saves the planet from destruction, but at the cost of collapsing the [[Faster-than-light|FTL]] node that allows access to the system. By the end of ''[[FreeSpace 2]]'', Earth is still sealed off and has had no contact with the outside systems for 32 years, but the Alliance is hopeful they have found a way to restore travel to the Sol system.
* In the ''[[AT-43]]'' universe, Earth, known as "Sol III" was the home planet of the humans who became the Therian faction. In this future, Earth was destroyed (after the Therians recklessly used up its resources) and the debris was used to form a [[Dyson sphere]] around the [[Sun]].
* In ''[[Little Fuzzy]]'', Earth is referred to as Terra, and is the center of a multi-planetary system, spanning many galaxies most likely.
* In the ''[[Funky Koval]]'' comic series, most events take place on 2080s Earth which is very similar to our own. However it is rather ruled by global corporations (Stellar Fox Syndicate is notable example) than political bodies like UN. Earth is also on the verge of wide galactic explorations with possess ion of subspace flight technology and maintain contact with at least two alien species: The Droll and Ancusans.
* In the ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' manga, Mamoru Chiba is the representative of Earth taking the place of a Sailor Soldier and becoming Tuxedo Kamen. (Tuxedo Mask)
* In the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series of video games, Earth is the industrial, economic and cultural capital of the human Systems Alliance; however, the military and political capital is at [[Arcturus]], 36 light years from Earth. As of 2183, when the game is set, Earth is looked upon as a near Utopian world, for it has been mentioned that Earth has reached a "New Golden Age". However, there is still violent weather due to environmental damages of the 21st century. But since developing faster-than-light travel among other advanced technologies, there have been  significant improvements to the state of the planet. The Systems Alliance itself is regarded as a sleeping giant, and humanity has quickly established itself as one of the most important and powerful races in the galaxy. Earth, like a number of other planets in the Mass Effect series, is attacked at the onset of the Reaper War and suffers catastrophic damage due to it being the focal point of the war, resulting in huge losses of life and many cities left in ruins, though it is implied that Earth is subsequently repaired in time.
* In his work ''[[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', French author [[Jules Verne]] presented the concept of a hollow center of the planet inhabited by prehistoric beings. The secrets of this region were explored by a group of travelers from the surface.
* In the science fiction novel ''The Last Train out of Existence'' by Volarion Wendsar, Earth is described as having reached a period of societal stagnation thanks to the development of 'holographic cellular phones'. The Earth continues to remain in this indefinite state of stagnation until a fleet commandeered by an admiral known as Kress Milligan commits a nuclear genocide against the humans of Earth, most of whom are obliterated. The government of the galaxy, the Galactic Ascendancy, forbids any travel to and from the Earth and its star system, and quells any attempts at violating this, including destroy the ship of archaeologist Arord Trialens before he can reach the surface to conduct an expedition.

===''Battlestar Galactica''===
The overarching plot in both the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original]] and [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|re-imagined]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' is the quest to find Earth, which is thought to be the location of the lost thirteenth colony of [[Kobol]]. Colonial history dictates that [[Kobol]] is the homeworld of all humanity, and that the Thirteen Tribes of Kobol fled that world thousands of years earlier, with twelve tribes founding the Twelve Colonies and the thirteenth heading to Earth. Both shows are similar in that the location of Earth is initially unknown, but clues to its location are gradually discovered by the refugee fleet from the [[Twelve Colonies]]. In both series, the exodus of the Thirteen Tribes took place so far in the past that most modern Colonials have come to assume that the stories of Earth are simply religious myths.

====Original series====
In the original series, several clues indicate that the existence of Earth is real. On the prison planet of Proteus, [[Lieutenant Starbuck|Starbuck]] encounters drawings of star systems on the wall of a cell once occupied by a mysterious prisoner. The star charts turn out to be that of the [[Solar System]]. Additionally, when the ''Galactica'' later reaches a planet called Terra, it is inhabited by humans who use Earth units of measurement (hours, minutes, etc.) rather than Colonial units of measurement, suggesting that it was settled by members of the lost Thirteenth Tribe thousands of years earlier on their way to Earth.

In ''[[Galactica 1980]]'', a continuation of the original series, the fleet did eventually discover Earth as it was in 1980.

====Re-imagined series====
In the Season Three finale of the re-imagined series, [[Kara Thrace]] returns to ''Galactica'' after her apparent death, claiming to have been to Earth and intending to lead the fleet there. The camera then pans out from the fleet to view the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, and then zooms back in to show Earth, confirming the existence of the planet. In the Season Four mid-season finale episode "Revelations", the fleet finally reaches Earth, only to discover that it is a lifeless, radioactive wasteland.

In "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]", it is revealed that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of humanoid and mechanical Cylons of a type previously unknown. It is also revealed that the final five Cylons had previously lived on Earth 2000 years in the past, when a [[nuclear war]] devastated the planet.

In the final episode, a [[twist ending]] shows ''Galactica'' reaching our Earth, 150,000 years ago. The Colonials and the Cylons they've made peace with decide to call their new world "Earth" due to the hope associated with the name of the now devastated planet the Thirteenth Tribe once inhabited. They then abandon their technology and live among the new Earth's native [[Hominini]]. 150,000 years later, in the present day, the remains of [[Mitochondrial Eve]] – a Colonial human/Cylon hybrid (named [[Hera Agathon]]) whose birth and destiny had been a major plot element of the series – are discovered.

===''Buck Rogers''===
In most variations on the ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' mythos (comic strip, TV series, feature film), Earth of the 25th century (where the action takes place) is recovering from various atomic wars, usually variations on [[World War III]]. In the original comic, [[Mongols]] have taken over the Earth; in the [[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|TV series]], the Draconian Empire fills this role (although the Draconians are obviously based on Mongols). Most of Earth's cities lie in ruins, although rebuilding is in progress (Earth's capital is New Chicago; other cities include New Paris, New London etc.). The second season of the TV series revealed that much of Earth's population fled the planet in the wake of the atomic war and founded colonies in deep space; the Earth ship ''Searcher'' is dispatched to investigate.

===''Buffyverse''===
In [[Joss Whedon]]'s [[Buffyverse]], established by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', Earth is one of several [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]; the term "Earth" is used both to refer to the specific planet and to the dimension the planet exists in as a whole. Born from the Seed of Wonder, the source of all [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], Earth originated as a world of [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Demons]], and was ruled over by the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]] during a time known as the Primordium Age. Eventually, however, the human race rose up and fought back against the Old Ones, banishing them to other dimensions.

===''CoDominium''===
In [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s ''[[CoDominium]]'' series (now largely [[alternate history]]) the Earth comes under the control of the CoDominium, an alliance between the United States and [[Soviet Union]], in the year 1990. The CoDominium imposes its control over all other nations of the Earth, halting scientific development and warfare. The CoDominium is ruled by a Grand Senate located on the Moon, and eventually constructs interstellar colonies for the joint goal of economic gain and a means of exiling troublesome elements of society. Eventually in 2103, the CoDominium dissolves, with the US and USSR engaging in the nuclear "Great Patriotic Wars" which destroy almost all of Earth (it is mentioned that [[Jamaica]] and the [[German Tyrol|Tyrolean Alps]] are untouched).

The CD Space Navy escapes to the planet Sparta, which eventually becomes the nucleus of the "Empire of Man". During the Empire's Formation Wars the Earth is once more hit hard, but is eventually incorporated into the Imperium as the "honorary capital." When the Empire dissolves in the Secession Wars in the 27th century, Earth is once more subjected to nuclear attacks, but by the early 31st century has been reclaimed by the Second Empire. By that time, the Earth city of "New Annapolis" is a training center for the Imperial Space Navy. To inhabitants of planets newly contacted, such as [[CoDominium#Planets of the CoDominium and the Empire of Man|Prince Samual's World]] in "[[King David's Spaceship]]", the condition of the still largely desolate Earth is presented as an object lesson for the prohibitive price of war and a justification for Empire's claim to universal rule.

===''Dragon Ball''===
In [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series, Earth is the primary setting and one of many planets in the North Galaxy. The planet is inhabited by humans, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, and demons, among others. ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s Earth features heavy [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]], such as [[humanoid robot]]s and flying cars, as well as heavy magical influence.

===''Dune''===
In [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' series of novels, [[Earth]] is referred to as ''Old Earth / Old Terra'' by the time of the original novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (at least 21,500 years in the future). The [[Sun]] is called Al-Lat, and humanity had populated many planets (among them [[Caladan]], [[Giedi Prime]] and [[Salusa Secundus]]). In the time of [[Paul Atreides]], the Earth is an uninhabited and largely forgotten land, shrouded in legend. In ''[[Dune Messiah]]'', Paul refers to [[Hitler]] and [[Genghis Khan]], in comparing the destructiveness of his [[Jihad]] to their wars. It is a wilderness and recovering an ecosystem of its own as humans have abandoned it. The artifacts of ''Homo sapiens'' have for the most part crumbled back into the planet, though a more than casual observer can find many traces of the old civilizations.

Paul's son, the God Emperor [[Leto II Atreides|Leto II]], refers to the Earth many times in his journals. The God Emperor seemed particularly fond of the ancestors he had from the Western sections of [[Eurasia]]. He makes references to [[Israel]], [[Urartu]], (also called [[Armenia]]), [[Edom]], [[Damascus]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Babylon]], [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]], [[Umlias]], the plains of Central Asia, and the [[Greeks]]; the [[House Atreides#Relationship to Greek mythology|family name]] refers to their descent from [[Atreus]]. He seems to have had ancestors among the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] or the [[Mongols]] as he says that one of his memories involves a horse plain with felt [[yurt]]s. Leto also has the memories of a famous politician from the United States whose name was [[Jacob Broom]]. In the book Children of Dune, Leto II mentions an ancestor named [[Agamemnon]], and makes reference to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.

In ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'', it is noted that the [[Bene Gesserit]] Mother Superior [[List of Dune Bene Gesserit#Taraza|Taraza]] has the preserved [[Vincent van Gogh]] painting ''[[Thatched Cottages at Cordeville|Cottages at Cordeville]]'' hanging in her room.

In the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' series by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]], set in the Dune universe, it is revealed that at the beginning of mankind's war with the Machines, called the [[Butlerian Jihad]], Earth had been devastated by humans themselves using [[atomics (Dune)|atomics]] in an attack on the Machines. In the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] series, also by Herbert and Anderson, it is mentioned that certain [[Claude Monet|Monet]] and [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] paintings are owned by [[House Vernius]], and hang in the Grand Palais at [[Ix (Dune)|Ix]].

===''Firefly''===
In the [[Joss Whedon]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', Earth is long since abandoned. It is referred to with awe as "Earth-that-Was", having been abandoned centuries ago due to overpopulation and depletion of the planet's natural resources. After fleeing the planet, the remnants of humanity traveled in [[generation ship]]s for decades (many humans lived their entire lives within a spaceship's walls) until finding a new star system. Collection of Earth-that-Was artifacts is a hobby for the rich, and ancient Earth artifacts are known to be very valuable.

It is unknown whether Earth has actually been destroyed, or if the planet still physically exists; in the feature film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', ancient starships are shown leaving a sickly brown Earth with gray oceans, but the fate of the planet is never fully revealed. A puppet show in the episode "[[Heart of Gold (Firefly)|Heart of Gold]]" implies that Earth has in fact been obliterated, but this was never actually confirmed on screen.

===''Asimov's future histories''===
In much of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s fiction, the [[Earth (Foundation universe)|future Earth]] is an underprivileged planet — impoverished, overcrowded and disease-ridden — which is regarded with disdain by the arrogant [[Spacer (Asimov)|Spacers]] of the "Outer Planets" (at this stage, there are about fifty of them).

In the [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]], the inhabitants of these planets are still aware that their ancestors came from Earth, but this does not make them fond of the place. Rather, they develop a racist theory by which "the best strains" had left Earth to colonize the other planets and left "the inferior strains" behind. However, they have no choice but to ask the help of the protagonist, a detective from the despised Earth, to solve murder mysteries which baffle their own police. Afterwards, Earth embarks on a major new campaign of space colonization, with the hope that the new colonists will prove more faithful to the Mother Planet than the earlier ones. However, in the end of the series, the Earth is doomed to a slow radioactive process that will leave the planet uninhabitable, causing a more rapid expansion of colonization from Earth.

In the [[Galactic Empire (series)|''Galactic Empire'' series]], taking place thousands of years later (originally conceived as completely separate but made by Asimov in his later career into the direct sequel of the Robot Period), Earth and settlements from it are still clearly remembered in ''[[The Stars, Like Dust]]''. By the time of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'', Earth is ruled by Trantor, not yet a Galactic Empire. Its status as the original homeworld of humanity is now disputed.

In ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]'', we see Earth in the early days of the Empire of [[Trantor]]. Earth has a largely radioactive crust with only patches of habitable land in between, and its people have to undergo compulsory [[euthanasia]] at the age of 60. It is a backwater province, and among inhabitants of other planets there is a prevalent prejudice known as "Anti-Terrestrialism", (obviously modeled on [[antisemitism]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}), with the main negative stereotype having to do with the radiation-induced diseases prevalent on Earth.

By this time, Earth people still believe themselves to be the original home of Humanity, but hardly anyone else shares this belief. Fanatical priests, based in a mysterious Temple erected on the ruins of Washington, D.C., cultivate the mystique of Earth's ancient glories and conceive a plot to spread a Terrestrial disease throughout the Galaxy and in this way take over the Empire (and incidentally, act out the stereotype). The plot is foiled by a middle-aged tailor from the Twentieth Century, who possess powerful psychic abilities as a result of experiments performed upon him when he arrived in the future.  Schwartz, the tailor, is often described as being Jewish, though this is never stated within the novel.

By the time of the Galactic Empire's decline, [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]] is vaguely remembered as 'Sol' in ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'', and only one candidate for being the Original World.  In ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'', records of Earth are missing, so two citizens of the mature Foundation go looking for it, and eventually find that it is desolated by nuclear radiation.  The only sentient being remaining in the Solar system is robot Daneel Olivaw, who resides in a small station on the moon, overseeing the progress of a humanity now spread throughout the galaxy.

===''Hainish Cycle''===
In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Hainish Cycle]] our Earth is referred to as Terra. Like all [[Planets of the Hainish Cycle|human worlds of the Hainish Cycle]], Terra was populated by the humans of Hain in Earth's prehistory, but forgot our common ancestry after millennia of no contact from extraterrestrial humans after the collapse of the first Hainish interplanetary civilization.

The second period of contact with the interstellar Hainish community, now organized as "The League Of All Worlds" is described in ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', and ''[[Rocannon's World]]''. In ''The Dispossessed'', Terra's population is said to have fallen from 9 billion to only half a billion people due to a collapse of the Terran ecology, and that life has only survived there because of strict rationing of resources and help from the Hainish. In ''The Word for World Is Forest'', the people from Terra appear as reckless exploiters of other planets. Some time later, ''[[City of Illusions]]'' provides a detailed description of Terra in the depths of a second era of isolation, called "The Age Of The Enemy".

The post-apocalyptic Earth seen in ''City of Illusions'' shows signs of an advanced, abandoned civilization under a rewilded landscape. A small number of humans live in tiny, isolated settlements where they retain some technologies from the past but are completely cut off from any communication with neighboring regions or with other worlds. There is only one city with high technology and energy-intensive construction, and it is controlled by the alien conquerors of the League. The events of ''City of Illusions'' lead to the third period of Terran contact with other worlds, this time as the Ekumen, during which ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' takes place.

In the short story "Dancing To Ganam," which takes place in the far future of the Hainish universe, it is said that an extreme religious movement called the Unists developed on Terra and engaged in mass slaughter of non-believers and then of rival Unists sects. It is described as "the worst resurgence of theocratic violence since the Time of Pollution". It unclear if this time of pollution refers to the [[ecological collapse]] described in ''The Dispossesed,'' the collapse seen in ''City Of Illusions'', or is another unexplored dark period on Terra. In any case, the inclusion of this story is meant to show that even after so many millennia in the League and the Ekumen, Terra is still in many ways culturally primitive and prone to violent self-destruction.

Various individuals from Terra play a part in other stories. In ''[[The Telling]]'', Terra's incorporation into the Ekumen is briefly explained. Also, the main character in ''The Left Hand of Darkness'' is from Terra.

===''Hitchhiker's Guide''===
In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]], the [[Earth (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Earth]] is destroyed by a Vogon Constructor Fleet to make room for a hyperspace bypass.  One of two surviving Earthmen, [[Arthur Dent]], is affronted and dismayed to find that his planet's entry in the Guide consists of one word: "Harmless".  [[Ford Prefect]], a researcher for the Guide attempts (and fails) to placate him by informing him that he has written a more extensive article for the next edition, although the result of merciless editing of his original draft has reduced his version considerably, now reading "Mostly harmless".  Dent also learns that the Earth was originally constructed by the inhabitants of the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]], as a giant supercomputer built to find the Question to [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|the Ultimate Answer of Life, The Universe and Everything]].  The computer was so large that it was often mistaken for a planet, and that it was destroyed five minutes before the program was due to complete (after ten million years of running).  It also mentions that humans are descended from the passengers of an ark full of unwanted middlemen (hairdressers, telephone sanitizers, advertising executives and the like), tricked into leaving their own planet behind by spurious tales of impending destruction invented by the rest of the planet's civilization (it is mentioned that the population was then wiped out by a disease contracted from a dirty telephone).  The Earth was located in Galactic sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.  An alternate version of Earth is the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#NowWhat|NowWhat]], which occupies the same space as Earth, but not the same probability. In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|2005 film adaptation]], a new Earth replaces the old one, and everything is restored to the moments leading up to its destruction, except for one thing: Arthur Dent is not part of the planet anymore, at his own request.

===''Red Dwarf''===
In the series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', Earth is seen mainly as the goal of the crew's trip; [[Dave Lister]] is personally obsessed with revisiting it as his home world, especially since he is the only character to be from there as [[Arnold Rimmer]] was born on [[Io (moon)|Io]]. The novel ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' mentions the Earth, despite Lister's regard for it, as suffering from massive littering and environmental damage; with a giant [[toupee]] being installed to in order to cover up [[ozone depletion]]. The novel ''[[Better Than Life]]'', however, mentions Earth being voted out of inhabitability to be the solar system's chosen planet of refuse known as Garbage World. A [[methane]] build up "farts" the planet out of the system and sends it out into deep space where it becomes an ice planet; later moved and thawed by the actions of the crew of ''Red Dwarf''. The Earth is inhabited by giant [[cockroach]]es and the descendants of [[GELF]]s sent there as punishment for their rebellion and bred into the [[GELF#The Polymorph|polymorph]]. Lister spends half a lifetime trapped there attempting to correct his species past actions before ''Red Dwarf'' can rescue him due to [[black hole]] [[time dilation]]. In ''[[Last Human]]'' a parallel Earth is doomed by the initiatives of Earth President John Milhous [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and humanity breeds GELFs and [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|simulants]] to terraform a new home across the multi-[[dimension]]al omni-zone.

===''Stargate''===
In the ''[[Stargate]]'' television series, Earth (designation: ''P2X-3YZ'') is described as one of countless inhabited worlds, and is revealed to be the original home world of humans all over the galaxy. In ancient history many groups of humans were kidnapped and enslaved by powerful alien races, primarily the [[Goa'uld]]. Others remained to form present day Earth societies, which interact covertly with other extraterrestrial races and civilizations, many of them human. Earth first became important in the scene after the [[Alterans]] occupied it as their new capital (its name was Terra at that point). When they were forced to relocate to Lantea in the Pegasus galaxy (several million years ago), they "seeded" the planet with a less advanced form of themselves. Eventually, the Goa'uld found the planet and determined that the human body is the ultimate host body for their parasitic race. Many humans were kidnapped through the Stargate the Supreme System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] brought to Earth (Earth already had its own Stargate in Antarctica but it was inoperable) but the leftover population wasn't touched; they eventually rebelled and drove the Goa'uld off the planet in 3000 BC. About 8000 BC, the Lantean remnants returned to the planet but the primitive civilization extinguished their last hope of rebuilding their once great civilization due to the presence of the Goa'uld; as such, the Ancients slowly died out or [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascended]] since their numbers were too small to survive, even by crossbreeding with regular humans.

With Earth largely left alone for millennia, its human population continued to advance until the rediscovery of the Stargate in 1928 and its subsequent reactivation in 1994 (since its DHD activation device was missing, they had been unable to determine its purpose until they were able to create a computer interface). Unlike an enormous majority of planets, the Stargate on Earth was kept secret from the general populace to prevent widespread panic because "we are not alone".

Humans who are from Earth are referred to as the [[Tau'ri]] by most other life forms in the galaxy, including the [[Goa'uld]]. Earth is a relatively important player on account of the radical change it unwittingly brought about when troops under the command of Colonel [[Jack O'Neill]] killed Goa'uld Supreme System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] and started a guerrilla war against the Goa'uld. However, its importance pales in comparison to the power of the [[System Lords]] or the [[Free Jaffa Nation]], even though after the extinction of the Asgard and the defeat of the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], the Tau'ri became the dominant race of known space — although they were initially at a huge technological disadvantage, they later managed to reverse-engineer Goa'uld technology to the point where they started building their own ships, though much of it was rendered obsolete when the Asgard granted a significant amount of non-weapon technology. The Tau'ri also created remarkable technological feats, such as fighters equipped with hyperdrives powered by an unstable isotope. Their power increased further when they discovered that, due to crossbreeding with Ancients before their extinction, some Earth-born humans actually possessed a unique gene required to operate some of the more advanced Ancient technology. The peak of their power occurred when the Asgard donated their entire technological knowledge to Earth prior to their extinction. With this and some Ancient technology, the Tau'ri actually surpassed their precursors and defeated the Ori.

The main interaction between Earth and the rest of the universe is via three organizations:

*  The '''[[International Oversight Advisory]]''' (IOA) coordinates funds and control between the nations of the Earth [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]; the [[Stargate Atlantis|Atlantis Expedition]] was sent to the Pegasus Galaxy under its authority. The key players are the Big Five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]: the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the People's Republic of China, and the [[Russia]]n Federation; also important are [[Canada]], on account of its [[Canada – United States relations|special relationship with the United States]] and the services of Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], and other nations, such as Japan, Australia, and Germany, which have also been involved; Germany in particular has sent security personnel to [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]].
* '''[[Stargate Command]]''', under the control of the IOA and operated by the [[United States Air Force]], conducts off-world missions of diplomacy, tactical strikes, research and exploration. Control of the Stargate is a constant bone of contention with the Chinese, who take every opportunity to express their displeasure at the situation at IOA meetings where the future of Stargate Command is an issue (even though their off-world allies are satisfied with the current situation). Nevertheless, the SGC remains the primary interface between the humans of Earth and the outside world, including the galactic human diaspora.
* '''The Atlantis Expedition''' is based in the still sea- and space-worthy [[Atlantis (Stargate)|city-ship]] of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] in the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]].  An international team, with [[Tau'ri characters in Stargate Atlantis|personnel from at least 23 countries]], interacts with the other humans of the Pegasus Galaxy (seeded by the Ancients, not taken by the [[Goa'uld]]) and the dangerous [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]].  They rely on a mixture of Ancient and Earth technology and were originally based on Lantea until they were forced to relocate to M35-117. The expedition is currently suspended as Atlantis remains on Earth until repairs are completed after its most recent clash with the Wraith.

===''Star Trek''===
In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the unified human state based on Earth, was one of the founding members of the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Several major [[federation|federal]] organizations are headquartered on Earth, such as the Federation Council which meets in Paris. The Federation President also keeps offices in Paris, and [[Starfleet]] Headquarters is located in San Francisco. Major events on Earth included first contact with the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] (''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''), barely averted attacks by the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] (in "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" and ''Star Trek: First Contact''), Founder infiltration ("[[Homefront (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Homefront]]"), and [[List of fictional revolutions and coups#Star Trek|numerous attempted coups]]. Like most other major Federation worlds, Earth is a near-utopia where poverty and war have been eradicated and environmental damage has been reversed. Earth was also the planet of origin for at least one other sentient species, the Voth, according to the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Distant Origin]]". Descendants of the [[hadrosaurid]]æ, they are theorized to have fled Earth for the [[Delta Quadrant]] after an [[extinction event]].

In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[The Forge (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forge]]", we learn that the name of the planet's actual government is named United Earth. Much of its early history is unknown, although recent Trek novels have revealed that Earth's governments founded United Earth by signing the historic ''Traite d'Unification'' in 2123.  The episodes "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]" imply that United Earth is a [[parliamentary system]] of government: we meet various government officials who are referred to as Ministers (such as Minister Nathan Samuels, played by [[Harry Groener]]). United Earth's leader is most likely a Prime Minister – possibly, but not necessarily, Samuels himself. In the novels, Earth's governmental structure is further developed. Earth is a [[parliamentary republic]], with a separate [[head of state]] (the President) and [[head of government]] (the Prime Minister).

In the [[Mirror Universe]], Earth is the capital of the despotic Terran Empire which rules over large portions of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants and is generally seen as the most powerful interstellar empire. ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' revealed that the Empire had collapsed and fallen to a [[Klingon]]–[[Cardassian]] Alliance. ''Star Trek'' novels reveal that Earth was later liberated thanks to the efforts of anti-Alliance rebels and Memory Omega.

===''Starcraft''===
Earth is the "lost" homeland of the terrans of the Koprulu Sector, often referred to as "Old Earth". Earth history is well known to us until the 21st century.
However, by the time the 23rd century was reached, genetic engineering and cybernetics were in common use, and Earth's population had reached 23 billion. Consequently, a resource and overpopulation crisis was developing.

Earth's corporate factions who supported the capitalization of genetic engineering and cybernetics were opposed by those who saw this as a degeneration of the human race. These groups included humanist factions as well as religious conservatives who resorted to terrorism in these turbulent times. The conflict was resolved by the creation of the United Powers League, which generally supported the humanist philosophy and controlled all nations except for a few volatile Latin American states. The UPL banned many religions and made English the worldwide language.

The UPL proceeded to arrest and kill many people who opposed its "divinity of mankind" philosophy (which included "purity" from cybernetics, mutations, and so forth). It was during this time that Doran Routhe set up the colonization of the Koprulu Sector. Contact between the colonists and Earth was seemingly lost, and the Koprulu Sector terrans could not have found their way back to Earth.

With the discovery of the protoss and zerg, the United Powers League reformed to become the United Earth Directorate and launched an invasion of the Koprulu Sector, ostensibly in an effort to protect itself from the distant aliens. The invasion was repelled by a tenuous alliance of the Sector's powers.

===''Babylon 5''===
{{Main article|Earth (Babylon 5)|l1=Earth (''Babylon 5'')}}
In the universe of the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' television series, Earth was located in a relatively uncontested and non-valuable portion of the Galaxy. As a result, the people of Earth were allowed to develop with relatively little outside interference or threat of invasion from alien races. Unified under the worldwide government of the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], first contact with the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] was made in the mid-22nd century, which led to trade with a number of different species.

Earth remained a relatively minor power until the 2230s, when it intervened on behalf of a number of other races (which later became the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]]) during the Dilgar invasion. Following the [[Dilgar War]], Earth began to expand its influence and was seen as a rising power in the galaxy. A disastrous [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with the [[Minbari]] in the 2240s precipitated the [[Earth–Minbari War]], in which Earth was nearly conquered: the military ([[EarthForce]]) was devastated and the planet's population was nearly annihilated. However, the Minbari mysteriously surrendered just prior to the final invasion of Earth.

Following the war, Earth's major contribution on the galactic stage was the creation of the Babylon Stations, that are neutral trading posts and diplomatic havens. Earth turned inward and suffered from xenophobic tendencies in the late 2250s, early 2260s under the despotic regime of President [[Morgan Clark]], until a military and civilian [[civil war]], started by General William Hague and later concluded by Captain [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]], overthrew the Clark regime and helped establish Earth as one of the major players in the [[Interstellar Alliance]].

===''Robotech / Macross''===
In the ''[[Robotech]]'' canon, based on ''[[Macross]]'', Earth is the homeworld of humanity and notable as one of the few places that "The flower of life" (the source of the powerful energy source Protoculture) can grow. In 1999 during a global war the (future) SDF-1 an alien warship crashed to Earth on Macross island. Discovering they were not alone in the universe (and in secret the fact that the SDF-1 was a warship for a giant sized alien race) the human race united and rebuilt the ship as well as using the technology to advance their own and to create a small defence fleet for earth.

Ten years later the ship was ready but as preparation for launch on a mission of exploration continued Zentradi warships arrived in orbit to search for the ship. Though humanity tried peaceful contact a booby trap in the SDF-1 fired the huge main gun at the Zentradi committing Earth to a devastating interstellar war. To lure the Zentradi away from Earth the SDF-1 attempted a space fold [[Faster-than-light|FTL jump]]. This went wrong transporting not only the SDF-1 but part of Macross Island, 70,000 civilians and two navy warships to an area near Pluto. Pressure held in sub-surface shelters long enough to evacuate the civilians while the ships were grafted on to the SDF-1 as flight decks. However the jump also caused the FTL drive to vanish (for unknown reasons) as such the SDF-1 had to return home under normal thrust fighting Zentradi all the way and unable to talk to earth due to jamming.

During the conflict many Zentradi became fascinated by Earth culture and over a million ships eventually defected. The ship finally returned to Earth but was driven back into space to draw off the Zentradi again. However the Zentradi bought over four million ships to Earth and bombarded the planet. The SDF-1 took out most ships with an overload of its shield system but in the process the ship was left incapable of flight and most of the Earth's population was killed. Over the next two years the survivors tried to rebuild and at last the Earth began to green again.

Twenty years later the Earth had recovered during the war with the Robotech masters, but even after Earth's victory the planet was then attacked and occupied by another set of aliens The Invid in 2031. The Invid collected what they could of the Protoculture on Earth but seem to have left the population (now millions once more) largely alone.

In 2042 the Robotech Mars expedition returned from deep space but was wiped out by the Invid during the battle to liberate the planet. The survivors were forced down to Earth where they hooked up with the local resistance groups.

Two years later a massive fleet arrived with more advanced technology given to them by the alien Hydenites. The Invid quickly left Earth rather than risk Earth's destruction by deadly weapons the Neutron_S missiles which were far more dangerous than man believed. As Humanity celebrated however the Hydenites were revealed as the Children of Shadow who had destroyed the Invid homeworld eons before. They launched a sneak attack on the human space station liberty. Another war then began.

===''Sonic the Hedgehog''===
In the various continuities of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' franchise, Earth is mentioned in one way or another:

*The video game series has [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] living on Earth, specifically a United States-like [[fictional country]] known as the United Federation. It is stated in ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'' that the planet has been in an endless cycle of destruction and resurrection since time immemorial: a monster known as Dark Gaia hibernates within the Earth's core, absorbing power from the negative energies and emotions of humanity, and destroys the planet when it emerges, and its counterpart, Light Gaia (a.k.a. "Chip"), defeats it and restores the Earth. In the game's plot, [[Doctor Eggman]], hoping to use Dark Gaia's power to build his empire, breaks the planet open himself and awakens both Light and Dark Gaia ahead of schedule; as a result, Dark Gaia's body splits apart, and Light Gaia develops severe [[amnesia]].
*The [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic book]] by [[Archie Comics]] reveals that the planet of [[Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Mobius]] is actually the Earth of a distant future; an alien race known as the Xorda launched several bombs meant to exterminate humanity, but instead ended up mutating the various wildlife, giving them [[humanoid]] forms, human [[cognition]], and (in many cases) [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]].
*[[Fleetway]]'s ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'' shows Earth existing as a separate planet from Mobius; the two planets are effectively "[[Double planet|twins]]", both having near-identical [[ecosystem]]s.
*In the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Original Video Animation|OVA]], the planet Freedom (specifically the Land of Darkness) is heavily implied to be a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] Earth. Early on in the film, Sonic and [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] are seen traveling through what appears to be the ruins of New York City.
*In the [[anime]] series ''[[Sonic X]]'', Sonic, his friends, and Eggman hail from an alternate version of Earth; Mobius and Earth were once one planet, but a cataclysmic event split the planet into two and sent what would become Mobius into another dimension. The flow of time is different on both planets; one month in Mobuis equals an entire year on Earth.

===''Super Mario''===
* According to various sources, including ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', the Mushroom Kingdom and its surrounding areas and locations are part of the "Mushroom World," a parallel version of the Earth, or "Real World." One can travel back and forth between the two dimensions through warp pipes.
* In the [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|1993 live-action film]], it is stated that the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] actually split Earth into two and sent them into different dimensions. The surviving [[dinosaur]]s were sent to the alternate dimension, and that world's version of the [[human]] race eventually evolved from those dinosaurs rather than [[mammal]]s. Aside from Dinohattan, a run-down parallel version of [[New York City]], the entirety of the alternate Earth is a desert wasteland.

===''Uplift''===
At least a billion years ago in the [[Uplift Universe]] by [[David Brin]], there was a semi-mythical species known as the Progenitors that started the Uplift cycle—adopting a pre-sentient race and over a period of a hundred thousand years of selective breeding and genetic engineering, raising them to full sentience.  As a result, most sentient species in the universe are members of various clans and factions, often quite powerful, with varying beliefs.

Earth was overlooked and humans evolved, evidently without a patron race.  However, by the time of first contact with galactic civilization, humans had themselves raised chimpanzees and dolphins to sentience, giving the human race a claim to patron status.  This claim is provisionally accepted by the major institutions of galactic civilization even as it is hotly contested by a number of senior patron races.

Galactic civilization holds humanity's claim of having evolved to sentience independently to be highly controversial at best, and an offensive heresy at worst. Some clans holding the latter view have actively conspired to have humanity's patron status officially vacated and to adopt the "wolfling" race themselves, thus gaining three sentient races and control of "fallow" genetic material: Earth's wealth of species with uplift potential.  Only the conservative and ponderous nature of galactic institutions and the rivalry of other clans reluctant to see the Earth's races claimed by another have prevented this.

===''Worldwar''===
In the [[Worldwar]] novels by [[Harry Turtledove]], Earth is the human homeworld and is attacked by the aliens known as The Race in 1942. All sides in the Second World War are forced to unify to fight this threat, and despite superior technology the Lizards (a human racial epithet for the aliens) are fought to a draw by 1944.

In 1962 another Race fleet arrives carrying a civilian colony force of nearly 100 million, in 1965 the Race and the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] fight a major war which Germany loses.

In 1994 humanity has caught up to the Race enough to send a slower-than-light starship to the Race's home world, where it arrives in 2031. Soon after another ship arrives, an [[Faster-than-light|FTL-capable]] ship, indicating that humanity has now surpassed the Race in technology.

===''MOTHER / EarthBound''===
* In the ''[[EarthBound|MOTHER / EarthBound]]'' video game series, Earth has different continent names and different cities but is still the same. Between 2000 and 2010, an alien known as Giygas took over the planet and destroyed most of the population. But, with the warning from a small alien from the future, a young hero named [[Ness (EarthBound)|Ness]] saved the world from Giygas before he could attack.
* Many thousands of years later, all the population of Earth was killed – presumably because the planet was flooded – but some people went on the [[Mother 3|Nowhere Island]] before everything was destroyed. The island was protected because it contained a great power that was sealed long ago. The survivors hid their memories in an [[egg (biology)|egg]] and created new ones, better ones so that they could have a normal life without remembering the world of before. Later in the game, Earth was again destroyed but then recreated as it was before. It is unknown if it means before the planet was flooded or before the game's tragic events.

===''Shannara''===
In the [[Shannara]] series of books by [[Terry Brooks]], the setting is a post-apocalyptic earth that was destroyed after a nuclear holocaust wiped out most of humanity and mutated the survivors into Men, Gnomes, Dwarves, and Trolls. Elves are also there, but according to Allanon's recounting of history, the Elves always existed in our current world. Before the Great Wars, as the nuclear holocaust is referred to, humans had advanced to a utopian society.

===''The Death Gate Cycle''===
In the [[Death gate cycle]] series of books by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]], a nuclear holocaust led to the creation of a two mutant strains of humans who developed fantastic magical powers. Other races, such as Dwarves and Elves were also present, even in pre-holocaust Earth, but were hidden from humanity.  In this universe, the Earth was destroyed by the Sartan, one of the magical races that evolved from humans.

Earth-centered religion or [[nature worship]] is a system of religion based on the veneration of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/406588/nature-worship Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers any [[religion]] that [[worship]]s the [[earth]], [[nature]], or [[fertility deity]], such as the various forms of [[Mother Goddess|goddess worship]] or [[matriarchal religion]]. Some find a connection between earth-worship and the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Earth religions are also formulated to allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the earth.

==Origins==
[[File:Annarbor tree.jpg|thumb]]

===Origin claims by earth religion sources===
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Old Europe (archaeology)|pre-Indo-European]] societies lived in small-scale, family-based communities that practiced [[matrilineal succession]] and goddess-centered religion&lt;ref name="From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2002 |last=French |first=Marilyn |title=From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women in the World | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyr9pwbqeqoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Slavic+matrilinear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iftdUb2HOoq-8AToy4G4BA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Slavic%20matrilinear&amp;f=false |publisher=McArthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; where creation comes from the woman. She is the Divine Mother who can give life and take it away. In [[Irish mythology]] she is [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], in [[Slavic mythology]] she is [[Mat Zemlya]], and in other cultures she is [[Pachamama]], [[Ninsun]], [[Terra (mythology)|Terra Mater]], [[Nüwa]], [[Matres and Matrones|Matres]] or [[Shakti]].

In the late 1800s, [[James Weir (1856-1906)|James Weir]] wrote an article describing the beginnings and aspects of early religious feeling. According to Boyer, early man was forced to locate food and shelter in order to survive, while constantly being directed by his instincts and senses. Because man's existence depended on nature, men began to form their religion and beliefs on and around nature itself. It is evident that man's first religion would have had to develop from the material world, he argues, because man relied heavily on his senses and what he could see, touch, and feel. In this sense, the [[nature worship|worship of nature]] formed, allowing man to further depend on nature for survival.&lt;ref name="Lust and Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weir|first=James|title=Lust and Religion|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26071/26071-h/26071-h.htm|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|format=EBook|date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]] have tried to make claims that religion started in ways that correspond to earth religion. In one of their published works, ''The Urantia Book'',  another reason for this worship of nature came from a fear of the world around primitive man.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2" /&gt;  His mind lacked the complex function of processing and sifting through complex ideas. As a result, man worshiped the very entity that surrounded him every day. That entity was nature. Man experienced the different natural phenomena around him, such as storms, vast deserts, and immense mountains. Among the very first parts of nature to be worshiped were rocks and hills, plants and trees, animals, the elements, heavenly bodies, and even man himself. As primitive man worked his way through nature worship, he eventually moved on to incorporate spirits into his worship.&lt;ref name="Urantia Book 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright Morning Star|title=The Urantia Book|year=2005|publisher=Uversa Press|location=New York|isbn=0965197220|pages=805–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MfMsljJW3gC&amp;pg=PA806&amp;lpg=PA806&amp;dq=%22The+objects+of+worship+were+altogether+suggestive;+they+consisted+of+the+things+of+nature+which+were+close+at+hand,+or+which+loomed+large+in+the+commonplace+experience+of+the+simple-minded+primitive+Urantians%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IqLZ2C00XB&amp;sig=b8eFU33wB5hl6ekR_BZSjG3rpro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5ZIUZiOLsWTyQHrnoCQBg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20objects%20of%20worship%20were%20altogether%20suggestive%3B%20they%20consisted%20of%20the%20things%20of%20nature%20which%20were%20close%20at%20hand%2C%20or%20which%20loomed%20large%20in%20the%20commonplace%20experience%20of%20the%20simple-minded%20primitive%20Urantians%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these claims may have some merit, they are nonetheless presented from a biased position that cannot be authenticated by traditional and reliable sources. Therefore, their claims can not be relied upon.

===Origins of religion===
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

The origins of religion can be looked at through the lens of the function and processing of the human mind. [[Pascal Boyer]] suggests that, for the longest period of time, the brain was thought of as a simple organ of the body. However, he claims that the more information collected about the brain indicates that the brain is indeed not a "blank slate."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained|year=2001|publisher=A Member of the Perseus Book club|location=New Work|isbn=0465006965|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just learn any information from the environment and surroundings around them. They have acquired sophisticated cognitive equipment that prepares them to analyze information in their culture and determine which information is relevant and how to apply it. Boyer states that "having a normal human brain does not imply that you have religion. All it implies is that people can acquire it, which is very different."&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; He suggests that religions started for the reasons of providing answers to humans, giving comfort, providing social order to society, and satisfying the need of the illusion-prone nature of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Religion Explained" /&gt; Ultimately, religion came into existence because of our need to answer questions and hold together our societal order.

An additional idea on the origins of religion comes not from man's cognitive development, but from the ape. Barbara J. King argues that human beings have an emotional connection with those around them, and that that desire for a connection came from their evolution from apes. The closest relative to the human species is the African ape.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Barbara J.|title=Evolving God: A Provocative View of the Origins of Religion|year=2007|publisher=Doubleday Religion|location=New York|isbn=0385521553}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 Mar 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At birth, the ape begins negotiating with its mother about what it wants and needs in order to survive. The world the ape is born into is saturated with close family and friends. Because of this, emotions and relationships play a huge role in the ape's life. Its reactions and responses to one another are rooted and grounded in a sense of [[belongingness]], which is derived from its dependence on the ape's mother and family. Belongingness is defined as "mattering to someone who matters to you ... getting positive feelings from our relationships."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;  This sense and desire for belongingness, which started in apes, only grew as the [[hominidae|hominid]] (a human ancestor) diverged from the lineage of the ape, which occurred roughly six to seven million years ago.&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

As severe changes in the environment, physical evolutions in the human body (especially in the development of the human brain), and changes in social actions occurred, humans went beyond trying to simply form bonds and relationships of empathy with others. As their culture and society became more complex, they began using practices and various symbols to make sense of the natural and spiritual world around them. Instead of simply trying to find belongingness and empathy from the relationships with others, humans created and evolved God and spirits in order to fulfil that need and exploration. King argued that "an earthly need for belonging led to human religious imagination and thus to the otherworldly realm of relating to God, gods, and spirits."&lt;ref name="Evolving God 2" /&gt;

==Encompassed religions==
The term ''earth religion'' encompasses any religion that worships the earth, nature or fertility gods or goddesses. There is an array of groups and beliefs that fall under earth religion, such as [[paganism]], which is a polytheistic, nature based religion; [[animism]], which is the worldview that all living entities (plants, animals, and humans) possess a spirit; [[Wicca]], who hold the concept of an earth mother goddess as well as practice ritual magic; and [[druidism]], which equates divinity with the natural world.

Another perspective of earth religion to consider is [[pantheism]], which takes a varied approach to the importance and purpose of the earth, and man's relationship with the planet. Several of their core statements deal with the connectivity humans share with the planet, declaring that "all matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part" and "we are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WPM Statement of Principles|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheism|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth also plays a vital role to many Voltaic peoples, many of whom "consider the Earth to be Heaven’s wife",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimoń|first=Henryk|title=The Sacredness of the Earth Among the Konkomba of Northern Ghana|journal=Anthropos|year=2003|volume=98|issue=2|pages=421–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Konkomba]] of northern Ghana, whose economic, social and religious life is heavily influenced by the earth. It is also important to consider various Native American religions, such as [[Peyote Religion]], [[Longhouse Religion]], and Earth Lodge Religion.

==Around the world==
April 22 was established as [[International Mother Earth Day]] by the [[United Nations]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10823.doc.htm |title=General Assembly Proclaims 22 April 'International Mother Earth Day' Adopting By Consensus Bolivia-Led Resolution |publisher=United Nations |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many cultures around the world have been celebrating the Earth for thousands of years. [[Winter solstice]] and [[Summer solstice]] are celebrated with holidays like [[Yule]] and [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongzhi]] in the winter and [[Tiregān]] and [[Kupala]] in the summer.

===Africa===
[[Animism]] is practiced among the [[Bantu peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rGpO_TzeCsC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=nature+worship+in+Africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XENeUaTVH4ym9gT0uIH4AQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=nature%20worship%20animism&amp;f=false |title=African Traditional Religion in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography p 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Dahomey mythology]] has deities like [[Nana Buluku]], [[Gleti]], [[Mawu]],     [[Asase Yaa]], [[Naa Nyonmo]] and [[Xevioso]].

===Europe===
In [[Baltic mythology]], the sun is a female deity, [[Saulė|Saule]], a mother or a bride, and [[Mēness]] is the moon, father or husband, their children being the stars. In [[Slavic mythology]] [[Mokosh]] and [[Mat Zemlya]] together with [[Perun]] head up the [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Celebrations and rituals are centered on nature and harvest seasons. [[Dragobete]] is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] spring holiday that celebrates "the day when the birds are betrothed."

===India===
In [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[yoni]] is the creative power of nature and the [[origin of life]]. In [[Shaktism]], the yoni is celebrated and worshipped during the [[Ambubachi Mela]], an annual fertility festival which celebrates the Earth's [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm|title=Celebrating The Divine Female Principle|last=Chawla|first=Janet|date=September 16, 2002|publisher=Boloji.com|accessdate=24 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100131031243/http://boloji.com/wfs/wfs082.htm| archivedate= 31 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Although the idea of earth religion has been around for thousands of years, it did not fully show up in popular culture until the early 1990s. ''[[The X-Files]]'' was one of the first nationally broadcast television programs to air [[witchcraft]] and [[Wicca]] (types of earth religion) content. On average, Wiccans - those who practice Wicca - were more or less pleased with the way the show had portrayed their ideals and beliefs. However, they still found it to be a little "sensationalistic". That same year, the movie ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'' was released - also depicting the art of Wicca. Unfortunately, this cinematic feature was not as happily accepted as ''The X-Files'' had been.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Juggler|url=http://culture.pagannewswirecollective.com/2010/08/a-time-line-of-wiccan-pop-culture/|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, programs showcasing the aforementioned religious practices - such as ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' - became widely popular. Although ''Charmed'' focused mostly on witchcraft, the magic they practiced very closely resembled Wicca. Meanwhile, ''Buffy'' was one of the first shows to actually cast a Wiccan character. However, since the shows focus was primarily on [[Vampire|vampires]], the Wiccan was depicted as having supernatural powers, rather than being in-tuned with the Earth.&lt;ref name="The Juggler"/&gt;

Other movies and shows throughout the last few decades have also been placed under the genre of Earth Religion. Among them are two of director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s most well known films - ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''. Both movies present human interaction with land, animal, and other nature spirits. Speakers for Earth Religion have said that these interactions suggest overtones of Earth Religion themes.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"&gt;{{cite web|last=krasskova|title=My Top 10 Pagan/Heathen Movies|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/pantheon/2010/11/my-top-10-paganheathen-movies/|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some popular Disney movies have also been viewed as Earth Religion films. Among them are ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]''. Those who practice Earth Religion view ''The Lion King'' as an Earth Religion film mainly for the "interconnectedness" and "Circle of Life" it shows between the animals, plants, and life in general. When that link is broken, viewers see chaos and despair spread throughout the once bountiful land. Congruently, ''Brother Bear'' portrays interactions and consequences when humans disobey or go against the animal and Earth spirits.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

Other earth religion movies include ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', ''[[The Deceivers (film)]]'', ''[[Sorceress (1982 film)]]'', ''[[Anchoress (film)]]'', ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', ''[[Agora (film)]]'', and ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)]]''. These movies all contain various aspects of earth religion and nature worship in general.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion Movies"/&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
[[File:Emirgan 04589.jpg|thumb]]

===Hindrance of progress===
Many religions have negative stereotypes of earth religion and neo-paganism in general. A common critique of the worship of nature and resources of "Mother Earth" is that the rights of nature and [[ecocide]] movements are inhibitors of human progress and development.&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley|title=Ecocide is Earth Religion|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/322526/ecocide-earth-religion|work=Human Exceptionalism|publisher=National Review Online|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This argument is fueled by the fact that those people socialized into 'western' world views believe the earth itself is not a living being. Wesley Smith believes this is “[[Antihumanism|anti-humanism]] with the potential to do real harm to the human family.”&lt;ref name="Ecocide is Earth Religion"/&gt; According to Smith, earth worshipers are hindering large-scale development, and they are viewed as inhibitors of advancement.

===Negative representatives===
A lot of criticism of earth religion comes from the negative actions of a few people who have been chastised for their actions. One such negative representative of earth religion is [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is believed to be "too preoccupied with awakening magical powers"&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slater|first=Herman|title=Earth Religion News|journal=geraldgardner.com|year=1976|volume=I|issue=1|pages=2–3|url=http://geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/Earth_Religion_News.php|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of putting the well-being of others in his coven. Crowley allegedly looked up to [[George Pickingill|"Old George" Pickingill]], who was another worshipper of nature who was viewed negatively. Critics regarded Pickingill as a Satanist and "England’s most notorious Witch".&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

Crowley himself was "allegedly expelled from the Craft because he was a pervert."&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt; He became aroused by torture and pain, and enjoyed being "punished" by women.&lt;ref name="The Great Beast: Aleister Crowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Symonds|first=John|title=The Great Beast|year=1952|publisher=Roy|isbn=0356036316|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dramatically damaged Crowley’s public image, because of his lifestyle and actions. Many people regarded all followers of earth religion as perverted Satanists.&lt;ref name="Earth Religion News"/&gt;

===Accused of Satanism===
Followers of earth religion have suffered major opprobrium over the years for allegedly being [[Satanism|Satanists]]. Some religious adherents can be prone to viewing religions other than their religion as being wrong sometimes because they perceive those religions as characteristic of their concept of Satan worship. To wit, [[Witchcraft]], a common practice of [[Wicca]]ns, is sometimes misinterpreted as Satan worship by members of these groups, as well as less-informed persons who may not be specifically religious but who may reside within the sphere-of-influence of pagan-critical religious adherents. From the Wiccan perspective, however, earth religion and Wicca lie outside of the phenomenological world that encompasses Satanism.&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Wicca?|url=http://www.thecircleofthesacredwell.org/more_info/what_is_wicca.htm|work=An Eclectic Neopagan Circle|publisher=The Circle of the Sacred Well|accessdate=12 March 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Wicca"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicca: a Neopagan, Earth-centered religion|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm|work=Religioustolerance.org|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An all-evil being does not exist within the religious perspective of western earth religions. Devotees worship and celebrate earth resources and earth-centric deities. Satanism and Wicca "have entirely different beliefs about deity, different rules for ethical behavior, different expectations from their membership, different views of the universe, different seasonal days of celebration, etc."&lt;ref name="What is Wicca?"/&gt;

Neo-pagans, or earth religion followers, often claim to be unaffiliated with Satanism.&lt;ref name="Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo-Pagan Witchcraft vs Satanism|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/introductory/neo-pagan_satanism.php|work=Confusions and Distinctions|publisher=The Pagan Library|accessdate=20 March 2013|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-pagans, Wiccans, and earth religion believers do not acknowledge the existence of a deity that conforms to the common Semitic sect religious concept of Satan. Satanism stems from Christianity, while earth religion stems from older religious concepts.&lt;ref name="Is Satanism Pagan?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vera|first=Diane|title=Is Satanism "Pagan"?|url=http://theisticsatanism.com/pagan/Is-Satanism-Pagan.html|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of Satanism as Religious Harassment====
Some earth religion adherents take issue with the religious harassment that is inherent in the social pressure that necessitates their having to distance themselves from the often non-uniform, Semitic sect religious concept of Satan worship. Having to define themselves as "other" from a religious concept that is not within their worldview implies a certain degree of outsider-facilitated, informal, but functional religious restriction that is based solely on the metaphysical and mythological religious beliefs of those outsiders. This is problematic because outsider initiated comparisons to Satanism with the intent of condemnation, even when easily refuted, can have the effect of social pressure on earth religion adherents to conform to outsider perception of acceptable customs, beliefs, and modes of religious behavior.

To illustrate, a problem could arise with the "other" than Satanism argument if an earth centered belief system adopted a holiday that a critic considered to be similar or identical to a holiday that Satanists celebrate. Satanists have historically been prone to adopting holidays that have origins in various pagan traditions, ostensibly because these traditional holidays are amongst the last known vestiges of traditional pre-Semitic religious practice in the west. Satanists are, perhaps irrationally, prone to interpreting non-Semitic holidays as anti-Christian and therefore as implicitly representative of their worldview. This is not surprising given the fact that this is, in fact, how many Christians interpret holidays such as [[Samhain]]. In spite of any flawed perceptions or rationale held by any other group, earth centered religion adherents do not recognize misinterpretation of their customs made by outside religious adherents or critics inclusive of Satan worshippers.

Organized Satan worship, as defined by and anchored in the Semitic worldview, is characterized by a relatively disorganized and often disparate series of movements and groups that mostly emerged in the mid-20th century. Thus, their adopted customs have varied, continue to vary, and therefore this moving target of beliefs and customs can not be justifiably nor continuously accounted for by earth centered religious adherents. Once a Satanist group adopts a holiday, social stigma may unjustifiably taint the holiday and anyone who observes it without discrimination as to whence and for what purpose it was originally celebrated. Given these facts, many earth centered religion devotees find comparisons to Satanism intrinsically oppressive in nature. This logic transfers to any and all religious customs to include prayer, magic, ceremony, and any unintentional similarity in deity characteristics (an example is the horned traditional entity Pan having similar physical characteristics to common horned depictions of Satan).

The issue is further complicated by the theory that the intra and extra-biblical mythology of Satan that is present throughout various Semitic sects may have originally evolved to figuratively demonize the heathen religions of other groups. Thus, the concept of Satan, or "the adversary", would have been representative of all non-Semitic religions and, by extension, the people who believed in them. Although, at times, the concept of the "other" as demonic has also been used to characterize competing Semitic sects. Amongst other purposes, such belief would have been extraordinarily useful during the psychological and physical process of cleansing Europe of traditional tribal beliefs in favor of Christianity. This possibility would account for the historical tendency of Christian authorities, for example, to deem most pagan customs carried out in the pagan religious context as demonic. By any modern standard, such current beliefs would violate western concepts of religious tolerance as well as be inimical to the preservation of what remains of the culture of long-persecuted religious groups.

==Ethics==
Because of the vast diversity of religions that fall under the title of ''earth religion'' there is no consensus of beliefs.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede" /&gt;  However, the [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs of most religions overlap. The most well-known ethical code is the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Many of those who practice an earth religion choose to be environmentally active. Some perform activities such as recycling or composting while others feel it to be more productive to try and support the earth spiritually.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt; These six beliefs about ethics seem to be universal.

===The Wiccan Rede===
"An [if] it harm none, do what ye will."&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Commonly worded in modern English as "if it doesn't harm anyone, do what you want."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Piper|first=David|title=Wiccan Ethics And The Wiccan Rede|url=http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wiccan_ethics_rede.php|publisher=paganlibrary.com|accessdate=15 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This maxim was first printed in 1964, after being spoken by the priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-20th century, and governs most ethical belief of Wiccans and some Pagans. There is no consensus of beliefs but this rede provides a starting point for most people's interpretation of what is ethical.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought"&gt;{{cite web|last=McColman|first=Carl|title=Principles of Moral Thought and Action|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Pagan/Ethics-Morality-Community/Principles-of-Moral-Thought-and-Action.html|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=14 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiccan Statement of Principles" /&gt;   The [[Wiccan Rede|rede]] clearly states to do no harm but what constitutes as harm and what level of self-interest is acceptable is negotiable.&lt;ref name="Principles of Moral Thought" /&gt;&lt;ref name="All About You" /&gt;  Many Wiccans reverse the phrase into "Do what ye will an it harm none," meaning "Do what you want if it doesn't harm anyone."&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; The difference may not seem significant but it is. The first implies that it is good to do no harm but does not say that it is necessarily unethical to do so, the second implies that all forms of harm are unethical. The second phrase is nearly impossible to follow. This shift occurred when trying to better adapt the phrase into modern English as well as to stress the "harmlessness" of Wiccans. The true nature of the rede simply implies that there is personal responsibility for your actions. You may do as you wish but there is a [[karma]] reaction from every action.&lt;ref name="Wiccan Ethics and the Wiccan Rede" /&gt; Even though this is the most well-known rede of practice, it does not mean that those that choose not to follow it are unethical. There are many other laws of practice that other groups follow.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Wiccan Rede"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lark|title=Beyond The Wiccan Rede - Other Pagan Ethics|url=http://realpagan.net/forum/topics/beyond-the-wiccan-rede-other|publisher=realpagan.net|accessdate=15 Mar 2013|date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Threefold Law===
[[Rule of Three (Wicca)|The Threefold Law]] is the belief that for all actions there is always a cause and effect. For every action taken either the good or ill intention will be returned to the action taker threefold. This is why the Wiccan Rede is typically followed because of fear of the threefold return from that harmful action.&lt;ref name=Threefold&gt;{{cite web|last=Wren|title=The Law of Three|url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usfl&amp;c=basics&amp;id=2872|publisher=witchvox.com|accessdate=19 Mar 2013|date=16 Jul 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor===
[[File:Leaf at Rocky Point of McDonald Lake.jpg|thumb]]
This term is what [[Emma Restall Orr]] calls reverence for the earth in her book ''Living with Honour: A Pagan Ethics''. She separates the term into three sections: courage, generosity and loyalty, or honesty, respect and responsibility. There is no evil force in Nature.&lt;ref name=Honor /&gt;&lt;ref name="WFT Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|title=WFT Ethics|url=http://www.wiccanfamilytemple.org/wft-ethics|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing exists beyond the natural, therefore it is up to the individual to choose to be ethical not because of divine judgment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58539">'''Emergy''' is the amount of energy that was consumed in direct and indirect transformations to make a product or service.&lt;ref name="EnvAcct"&gt;{{cite book|first = Howard T.|title = Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=P-ssAQAAMAAJ|page=370}}|year = 1996|publisher = Wiley|isbn = 978-0-471-11442-0|p = 370|last = Odum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy is a measure of quality differences between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of ''emjoule''s, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these quality differences is a key concept.

==History==

The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in [[thermodynamics]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[System theory|general system theory]]&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy. L. 1968. [[System theory|General System Theory]]. George Braziller Publ. New York 295 p.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name=SysEco&gt;Odum, H. T. 1983.  ''Systems Ecology: An Introduction''.  John Wiley, NY. 644 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution of the theory by [[Howard T. Odum]] over the first thirty years is reviewed in ''Environmental Accounting''&lt;ref name =EnvAcct/&gt; and in the volume edited by C. A. S. Hall titled ''Maximum Power''.&lt;ref name=SelfOrg&gt;Odum, H.T., 1995. Self organization and maximum power. Chapter 28, pp. 311-364 in ''Maximum Power'', Ed. by C .A. S. Hall, University Press of Colorado, Niwot.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] in ecosystems (''e.g.'' [[Silver Springs, Florida]];&lt;ref name=SilverSprings&gt;Odum, H. T. 1957.  Trophic structure and productivity of Silver Springs, Florida.  ''Ecol. Monogr''. 27:55-112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak atoll]] in the south Pacific;&lt;ref name=Eniwetok&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. P. Odum. 1955.  Trophic structure and productivity of a windward coral reef at Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands.  ''Ecol. Monogr.'' 25:291-320.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galveston Bay]], Texas&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;Odum, H. T. and C. M. Hoskin. 1958.  Comparative studies of the metabolism of Texas Bays.  ''Pubi. Inst. Mar. Sci.'', Univ. Tex. 5:16-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rican rainforests,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;Odum, H. T. and R. F. Pigeon, eds. 1970.  ''A Tropical Rain Forest''.  Division of Technical Information, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. 1600 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others) where energies in various forms at various scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems, and the differences in the [[potential energy]] of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and [[ocean current]]s led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system, they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality. This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost".&lt;ref name=FoodProd&gt;Odum, H. T. 1967.  Energetics of food production.  In: The ''World Food Problem, Report of the President's Science Advisory Committee, Panel on World Food Supply, Vol. 3''. The Whitehouse. pp. 55-94.&lt;/ref&gt; He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=FoodProd /&gt; and in the 1970s to [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref name= Congress&gt;Odum, H. T. ''et al.'' 1976.  Net Energy Analysis of Alternatives for the United States.  In ''U.S. Energy Policy: Trends and Goals'',  Part V – Middle and Long-term Energy Policies and Alternatives. 94th Congress 2nd Session Committee Print.  Prepared for the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, 66-723, U.S. Govt.  Printing Office, Wash, DC. pp. 254–304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Man&amp;Nature&gt;Odum, H. T. and E. C. Odum. 1976.  ''Energy Basis for Man and Nature''. McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Energy is measured by calories, [[btu]]'s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures.  The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=AMBIO&gt;Odum, H. T. 1973.  ''Energy, ecology and economics''.  Royal Swedish Academy of Science.  AMBIO 2(6):220-227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1975, he introduced a table of "Energy Quality Factors", kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy,&lt;ref name=NRGQuality&gt;Odum, H. T. 1976.  'Energy quality and carrying capacity of the earth.  Response at Prize Ceremony, Institute de la Vie, Paris.  ''Tropical Ecology'' 16(l):1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that "energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations" from one type of energy to the next.

These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE).&lt;ref name=NRGAnalysis&gt;Odum, H. T. 1977.  Energy analysis, energy quality and environment.  In ''Energy Analysis: A New Public Policy Tool'', M. W. Gilliland, ed.

The term "[[embodied energy]]" was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a "quality factor" for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another.&lt;ref name=EnvEdu&gt;Odum, E. C., and Odum, H. T., 1980. Energy systems and environmental education. Pp. 213–231 in: ''Environmental Education- Principles, Methods and Applications'', Ed. by T. S. Bakshi and Z. Naveh. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of "embodied solar calories", and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".

===Introduction of the term "emergy"===

Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when [[David M. Scienceman|David Scienceman]], a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term "emergy" and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy.&lt;ref&gt;Scienceman, D. M., 1987. "Energy and Emergy," in G. Pillet and T. Murota (eds), ''Environmental Economics: The Analysis of a Major Interface,'' R. Leimgruber, Geneva, pp. 257–276. (CFW-86-26)&lt;/ref&gt; The term transformation ratio was shortened to [[transformity]] in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.

After 1986, the emergy methodology continued to develop as the community of scientists expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. The [http://EmergySociety.org International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research] and a biennial [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231212/http://www.cep.ees.ufl.edu/conference.asp International Conference] at the University of Florida support this research.

==Definitions and examples==

'''''Emergy'''''— amount of energy of one form that is used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the '''emjoule''' or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.

'''''Unit Emergy Values (UEVs)''''' — the emergy required to generate one unit of output. Types of UEVs:
:'''''Transformity''''' — emergy input per unit of available energy output. For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.

:'''''Specific emergy''''' — emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work is required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.

:'''''Emergy per unit money''''' — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed in monetary terms)''.'' It is used to convert money into emergy units. Since money is paid for goods and services, but not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that money purchases. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.

:'''''Emergy per unit labor''''' — the emergy supporting one unit of direct labor applied to a process''.'' Workers apply their efforts to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured with the dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.

:'''''Empower''''' — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time)''.''

==Accounting method==

Emergy accounting converts the thermodynamic basis of all forms of energy, resources and human services into equivalents of a single form of energy, usually solar. To evaluate a system, a system diagram organizes the evaluation and account for energy inputs and outflows. A table of the flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step involves interpreting the results.&lt;ref name=EnvAcct /&gt;

===Purpose===

In some cases, an evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. It also allows comparison of alternatives. Another purpose is to seek the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality.

===Systems diagram===

[[File:Systems diagram of a city.png|thumb|alt=A systems diagram of a city embedded in its support region showing the environmental energy and non renewable energy sources that drive the region and city system|'''Figure 1''': Energy system diagram of a city in its support region]]
System diagrams show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a flow. A diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1.&lt;ref&gt;Many example diagrams can be found at [http://emergysystems.org/symbols.php EmergySystems.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309041649/http://www.emergysystems.org/symbols.php |date=2010-03-09 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation table===

A table (see example below) of resource flows, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items.

*Column # 3 is the raw data in joules, grams, dollars or other units.
*Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.
*Column # 5 is the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit. Sometimes, inputs are expressed in grams, hours, or dollars, therefore an appropriate UEV is used (sej/hr; sej/g; sej/$).
*Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).

All tables are followed by footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.

===Calculating unit values===

The table allows a unit emergy value to be calculated. The final, output row (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output.

===Performance indicators===

[[File:EmergyRatios5.png|thumb|alt=a basic diagram showing an economic progress that draws resources from the environment that are both renewable and non renewable energies and feedbacks from the main economy.|'''Figure 2''': Systems diagram showing flows used in the performance indicator ratios]]
Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that assess the global performance of a process.
* '''Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) —''' Emergy released (used up) per unit invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources.
* '''Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR''') — The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure a transformation process exerts on the environment and can be considered a measure of [[ecosystem]] stress due to a production (transformation activity.
* '''Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI''') — The ratio of EYR to ELR. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.
* '''Areal Empower Intensity —''' The ratio of emergy use in the economy of a region to its area. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.

Other ratios are useful depending on the type and scale of the system under evaluation.
* '''Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren''') — The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.
* '''Emprice'''. The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent in sej/$.
* '''Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER''') — The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to a trading partner and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.
* '''Emergy per capita —''' The ratio of emergy use of a region or nation to the population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.
* '''Emergy-based energy return on investment''' was introduced as a way to bridge and improve the concept of [[Energy returned on energy invested]] to also include environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Y.|last2=Feng|first2=L.|last3=Wang|first3=J.|last4=Höök|first4=M|title=Emergy-based energy return on investment method for evaluating energy exploitation|journal=Energy|date=2017|volume=128|issue=6|pages=540–549|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

The recognition of the relevance of energy to the growth and dynamics of [[complex systems]] has resulted in increased emphasis on  environmental evaluation methods that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.

Praeger Publishers, New York, 289 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergy theory has been criticized for allegedly offering an energy theory of value to replace other [[Labor theory of value|theories of value]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} The stated goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" valuation of systems, processes. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a different point of view.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The idea that a [[calorie]] of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the [[Newton's laws of motion|1st Law]] definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sciubba, E., 2010. On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis. Energy 35, 3696-3706.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have rejected the concept as impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to objectively quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market values.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

'''Cochlea''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|l|i|ə}} is Latin for “snail, shell or screw” and originates from the Greek word κοχλίας ''kohlias''. The modern definition, the auditory portion of the [[inner ear]], originated in the late 17th century. Within the mammalian cochlea exists the [[organ of Corti]], which contains [[hair cell]]s that are responsible for translating the vibrations it receives from surrounding fluid-filled ducts into [[electrical impulse]]s that are sent to the brain to process sound.&lt;ref name=Dugdale /&gt; This spiral-shaped cochlea is estimated to have originated during the early [[Cretaceous Period]], around 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Further, the auditory innervation of the spiral-shaped cochlea also traces back to the Cretaceous period.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The evolution of the human cochlea is a major area of scientific interest because of its favourable representation in the [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; During the last century, many scientists such as evolutionary biologists and paleontologists strove to develop new methods and techniques to overcome the many obstacles associated with working with ancient, delicate artifacts.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; In the past, scientists were limited in their ability to fully examine specimens without causing damage to them.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; In more recent times, technologies such as micro-CT scanning became available.&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt; These technologies allow for the visual differentiation between fossilized animal materials and other sedimentary remains.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; With the use of X-ray technologies, it is possible to ascertain some information about the auditory capabilities of extinct creatures, giving insight to human ancestors as well as their contemporary species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt;

== Comparative anatomy ==
While the basic structure of the inner ear in [[lepidosaurs]] (lizards and snakes), [[archosaurs]] (birds and crocodilians) and [[mammals]] is similar, and the organs are considered to be homologous, each group has a unique type of auditory organ.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The hearing organ arose within the lagenar duct of stem reptiles, lying between the saccular and lagenar epithelia. In lepidosaurs, the hearing organ, the basilar papilla, is generally small, with at most 2000 hair cells, whereas in archosaurs the basilar papilla can be much longer (&gt;10mm in owls) and contain many more hair cells that show two typical size extremes, the short and the tall hair cells. In mammals, the structure is known as the organ of Corti and shows a unique arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells. All mammalian organs of Corti contain a supporting tunnel made up of pillar cells, on the inner side of which there are inner hair cells and outer hair cells on the outer side. The [[definitive mammalian middle ear]] and the elongated cochlea allows for better sensitivity for higher frequencies.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

=== Lepidosaurs ===
As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) middle ear transmits sound to the footplate of the columella, which sends a pressure wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. In contrast, lizards tend to have two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5–8&amp;nbsp;kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Archosaurs ===
In birds and crocodilians, the similarity of the structure of the [[basilar papilla]] betrays their close evolutionary relationship. The basilar papilla is up to about 10mm long and contains up to 16500 hair cells. While most birds have an upper hearing limit of only about 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, the barn owl can hear up to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz and thus close to the human upper limit.&lt;ref name=Koeppl /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
{{See also|Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles}}
Egg-laying mammals, the monotremes (spiny anteater and platypus), do not have a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7&amp;nbsp;mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Amphibians ===
Amphibians have unique inner ear structures. There are two sensory papillae involved in hearing, the basilar (higher frequency) and amphibian (lower frequency) papillae, but it is uncertain whether either is homologous to the hearing organs of lepidosaurs, archosaurs and mammals and we have no idea when they arose.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Fish ===
Fish have no dedicated auditory epithelium, but use various vestibular sensory organs that respond to sound. In most teleost fishes it is the saccular macula that responds to sound. In some, such as goldfishes, there is also a special bony connection to the gas bladder that increases sensitivity allowing hearing up to about 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Neanderthals to modern humans ===
The size of cochlea has been measured throughout its evolution based on the fossil record. In one study, the basal turn of the cochlea was measured, and it was hypothesized that cochlear size correlates with body mass. The size of the basal turn of the cochlea was not different in Neanderthals and Holocene humans, however it became larger in early modern humans and Upper Paleolithic humans. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the cochlea is similar between Neanderthals and Holocene humans, relative to plane of the lateral canal, whereas early modern and upper Paleolithic humans have a more superiorly placed cochlea than Holocene humans. When comparing hominins of the Middle Pleistocene and Neanderthals and Holocene humans, the apex of the cochlea faces more inferiorly in the hominins than the latter two groups. Finally, the cochlea of European middle Pleistocene hominins faces more inferiorly than Neanderthals, modern humans, and Homo erectus.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt;
Human beings, along with Apes, are the only mammals that do not have high frequency (&gt;32&amp;nbsp;kHz) hearing.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt; Humans have long cochleae, but the space devoted to each frequency range is quite large (2.5mm per octave), resulting in a comparatively reduced upper frequency limit.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The human cochlea has approximately 2.5 turns around the modiolus (the axis).&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Humans, like many mammals and birds, are able to perceive auditory signals that displace the eardrum by a mere picometre.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;

== The ear ==
Because of its prominence and preserved state in the fossil record, until recently, the ear had been used to determine phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; The ear itself contains different portions, including the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear and all of these show evolutionary changes that are often unique to each lineage [14]. It was the independent evolution of a tympanic middle ear in the Triassic era that produced strong selection pressures towards improved hearing organs in the separate lineages of land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The cochlea is the tri-chambered auditory detection portion of the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt; Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials.&lt;ref name=Fernandez /&gt; This leads to the investigation of the relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

This spiral-shaped cochlea that is in both marsupial and placental mammals is traced back to approximately 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name= Manley /&gt; The development of the most basic basilar papilla (the auditory organ that later evolved into the Organ of Corti in mammals) happened at the same time as the water-to-land transition of vertebrates, approximately 380 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The actual coiling or spiral nature of the cochlea occurred to save space inside the skull.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The longer the cochlea, the higher is the potential resolution of sound frequencies given the same hearing range.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The oldest of the truly coiled mammalian cochleae were approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

The earliest evidence available for primates depicts a short cochlea with prominent laminae, suggesting that they had good high-frequency sensitivity as opposed to low-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; After this, over a period of around 60 million years, evidence suggests that primates developed longer cochleae and less prominent laminae, which means that they had an improvement in low-frequency sensitivity and a decrease in high-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; By the early Miocene period, the cycle of the elongation of the cochleae and the deterioration of the laminae was completed.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Evidence shows that primates have had an increasing cochlear volume to body mass ratio over time.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; These changes in the cochlear labyrinth volume negatively affect the highest and lowest audible frequencies, causing a downward shift.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Non-primates appear to have smaller cochlear labyrinth volumes overall when compared to primates.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Some evidence also suggests that selective forces for the larger cochlear labyrinth may have started after the basal primate node.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt;
 
Mammals are the subject of a substantial amount of research not only because of the potential knowledge to be gained regarding humans, but also because of their rich and abundant representation in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; The spiral shape of the cochlea evolved later on in the evolutionary pathway of mammals than previously believed, just before the therians split into the two lineages marsupials and placentals, about 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley  /&gt;

=== The evolution of prestins ===

Parallel to the evolution of the cochlea, [[prestins]] show an increased rate of evolution in therian mammals. Prestins are located in the outer hair cells of mammalian cochlea and are considered motor proteins. They are found in the hair cells of all vertebrates, including fish, but are thought to have initially been membrane transporter molecules. A high concentration of prestins are found only in the lateral membranes of therian outer hair cells (there is uncertainty with regard to concentrations in monotremes). This high concentration is not found in inner hair cells, and is also lacking in all hair cell types of non-mammals.&lt;ref name=Koeppl2 /&gt;  Prestin also has a role in motility, which evolved a greater importance in the motor function in land vertebrates, but this developed vastly differently in different lineages. In certain birds and mammals, prestins function as both transporters and motors, but the strongest evolution to robust motor dynamics only evolved in therian mammals. It is hypothesized that this motor system is significant to the therian cochlea at high frequencies because of the distinctive cellular and bony composition of the organ of Corti that allows the prestins to intensify movements of the whole structure.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;
Modern ultra-sound echolocating species such as bats and toothed whales show highly evolved prestins, and these prestins show identical sequence alterations over time. Unusually, the sequences thus apparently evolved independent from each other during different time periods. Furthermore, the evolution of neurotransmitter receptor systems (acetylcholine) that regulate the motor feedback of the outer hair cells coincides with prestin evolution in therians. This suggests that there was a parallel evolution of a control system and a motor system in the inner ear of therian mammals.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Homoplasies (convergent evolution) ===
Land vertebrates evolved middle ears independently in each major lineage, and are this the result of parallel evolution.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The configurations of the middle ears of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Furthermore, it is apparent that the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.&lt;ref name=Kitazawa /&gt;

'''Exertion''' is the [[Action (physics)|physical]] or perceived use of [[energy]].&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Newton's Third Law, Elert, Glenn. “Forces.” ''Viscosity – The Physics Hypertextbook'', physics.info/newton-first/.&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly ''effort,''resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion,&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; or in the performance of [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It often relates to [[Exercise physiology|muscular]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response.

==Physical==
In [[physics]], ''exertion'' is the expenditure of [[energy]] against, or inductive of, [[inertia]] as described by [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|third law of motion]]. In physics, '''force''' exerted equivocates '''work''' done.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Perceived Exertion, Barry, A. J. (1967). Physical activity and psychic stress/strain. ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', ''96''(12), 848–853.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Energy.html|title=Work and energy|website=physics.bu.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; In [[mechanics]] it describes the use of [[force]] against a [[Physical body|body]] in the direction of its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] (see [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]).

==Physiological==
Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood [[Lactate dehydrogenase|lactate]] concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] strength, as well as metabolic capability.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Kumar, Shrawan. “Theories of Occupational Musculoskeletal Injury Causation.” ''Biomechanics in Ergonomics, Second Edition'', July 2007, doi:10.1201/9780849379093.sec1.&lt;/ref&gt; This often correlates to an output of force followed by a [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Muscular energy reserves, or stores for [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and increased O2 consumption.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Golgi Tendon Organ.” ''Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics'', Elsevier, www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/golgi-tendon-organ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A [[rating of perceived exertion]], as measured by the ''RPE-scale'', or [[Borg scale]], is a quantitative measure of physical exertion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=Gunnar A.V|date=|title=Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion|url=http://fcesoftware.com/images/15_Perceived_Exertion.pdf|journal=Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gröpel, Peter, et al. “Endurance- and Resistance-Trained Men Exhibit Lower Cardiovascular Responses to Psychosocial Stress Than Untrained Men.” ''Frontiers in Psychology'', vol. 9, Jan. 2018, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00852.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year.{{Clarify|reason=when, where|date=November 2018}} An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Indications Of Physical Overexertion.” ''JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 71, no. 18, Feb. 1918, p. 1488., doi:10.1001/jama.1918.02600440040013.&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;“The Understated Injury: Overexertion.” ''Healthline'', Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/health/understated-injury-overexertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Graylag geese (Anser anser) in flight 1700.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Greylag geese (''[[Anser anser]]''). Birds are one of only four taxonomic groups to have [[evolution|evolved]] powered [[flight]].]]

A number of [[animal]]s have [[evolution|evolved]] '''aerial locomotion''', either by powered [[flight]] or by [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. '''Flying and gliding animals''' (''volant'' animals) have evolved separately many times, without any single ancestor. [[Flight]] has evolved at least four times, in the [[insect]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[bat]]s. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among [[rainforest]] animals, especially in the rainforests in [[Asia]] (most especially [[Borneo]]) where the [[tree]]s are tall and widely spaced. Several species of [[aquatic animal]]s, and a few [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically as a means of evading predators.

==Types==
Animal aerial locomotion can be divided into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using unpowered aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as their muscles are capable of doing so.

===Unpowered===
These modes of locomotion typically require an animal start from a raised location, converting that [[potential energy]] into [[kinetic energy]] and using aerodynamic forces to control trajectory and angle of descent. Energy is continually lost to drag without being replaced, thus these methods of locomotion have limited range and duration.
* [[Free fall|Falling]]: decreasing altitude under the force of [[gravity]], using no adaptations to increase [[Drag (physics)|drag]] or provide [[lift (force)|lift]].
* [[Parachuting]]: falling at an angle greater than 45° from the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] with adaptations to increase drag forces. Very small animals may be carried up by the [[wind]]. Some gliding animals may use their gliding membranes for drag rather than lift, to safely descend.
* [[gliding (flight)|Gliding flight]]: falling at an angle less than 45° from the horizontal with lift from adapted [[airfoil|aerofoil]] [[Patagium|membranes]]. This allows slowly falling directed horizontal movement, with streamlining to decrease drag forces for aerofoil efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] (wing length/breadth) than true flyers.

===Powered flight===
Powered [[flight]] has evolved only four times (first in insects, then in pterosaurs, birds and bats). It uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces and to replace energy lost to drag.
* [[Bird flight#Flapping|Flapping]]: moving [[wing]]s to produce lift and thrust. May ascend without the aid of the wind, as opposed to gliders and parachuters.

===Externally powered===
Ballooning and soaring are not powered by muscle, but rather by external aerodynamic sources of energy: the wind and rising thermals, respectively. Both can continue as long as the source of external power is present. Soaring is typically only seen in species capable of powered flight, as it requires extremely large wings.
* [[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning]]: being carried up into the air from the aerodynamic effect on long strands of silk in the wind. Certain silk-producing [[arthropod]]s, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight [[Gossamer (spider silk)|gossamer silk]] for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude. 
* [[Lift (soaring)|Soaring]]: gliding in rising or otherwise moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air is due to [[thermals]], [[ridge lift]] or [[lift (soaring)|other meteorological features]]. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.

Many species will use multiple of these modes at various times; a hawk will use powered flight to rise, then soar on thermals, then descend via free-fall to catch its prey.

==Evolution and ecology==

===Gliding and parachuting===
While gliding occurs independently from powered flight,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/11/new_theory_on_bat_flight_has_e_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; it has some ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very [[energy]]-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as [[fruit]]s, [[nectar]], and insects.&lt;ref name="rainforest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709003610/http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archivedate=2006-07-09 |title=Life in the Rainforest |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates); however these groups have not radiated nearly as much as have groups of flying animals.

Worldwide, the distribution of gliding animals is uneven as most inhabit rain forests in [[Southeast Asia]]. (Despite seemingly suitable rain forest habitats, few gliders are found in India or New Guinea and none in Madagascar.) Additionally, a variety of gliding vertebrates are found in [[Africa]], a family of [[Hylidae|hylids]] ([[flying frog]]s) lives in [[South America]] and several species of gliding squirrels are found in the forests of northern Asia and North America.&lt;ref name=Corlett&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corlett |first1=Richard T. |title=Tropical rain forests : an ecological and biogeographical comparison |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2011 |location=Chichester |isbn=978-1444332551 |pages=197, 200 |edition=2nd |author2=Primack, Richard B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0j8NROHQi8C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=south+american+gliding+frog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sRvEGT5a8F&amp;sig=cLFndvIrNFzOzlBTzPuGh93AQg0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PFRJT-86gefRAf_SrKUO&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20american%20gliding%20frog&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factors produce these disparities. In the forests of Southeast Asia, the dominant canopy trees (usually [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]]s) are taller than the canopy trees of the other forests. A higher start provides a competitive advantage of further glides and farther travel. Gliding predators may more efficiently search for prey. The lower abundance of insect and small vertebrate prey for carnivorous animals (such as lizards) in Asian forests may be a factor.&lt;ref name=Corlett/&gt;  In Australia, many mammals (and all mammalian gliders) possess, to some extent, prehensile tails.

===Powered flight===
[[File:Homology.jpg|upright|thumbnail| [[Homology (biology)|Analogous flying adaptions in vertebrates]]: {{ordered list |1=pterosaur ([[Pterosauria]]) |2=bat ([[Chiroptera]]) |3=bird ([[Aves]])}}]]

Powered flight has evolved unambiguously only four times—[[birds]], [[bats]], [[pterosaurs]], and [[insects]]. In contrast to gliding, which has evolved more frequently but typically gives rise to only a handful of species, all three extant groups of powered flyers have a huge number of species, suggesting that flight is a very successful strategy once evolved. [[Bat]]s, after [[rodent]]s, have the most species of any [[mammal]]ian order, about 20% of all mammalian [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simmons |first1=N.B. |title=Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference|date=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=312–529 |author2=D.E. Wilson, D.C. Reeder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bird]]s have the most species of any class of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s. Finally, [[insect]]s (most of which fly at some point in their life cycle) have more species than all other animal groups combined.

The evolution of flight is one of the most striking and demanding in animal evolution, and has attracted the attention of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend to fossilize infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, it can be difficult to discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider.

[[Insect wing#Evolution|Insects were the first to evolve flight]], approximately 350 million years ago. The developmental origin of the insect wing remains in dispute, as does the purpose prior to true flight. One suggestion is that wings initially were used to catch the wind for small insects that live on the surface of the water, while another is that they functioned in parachuting, then gliding, then flight for originally arboreal insects.

[[Pterosaurs]] were the next to evolve flight, approximately 228 million years ago. These reptiles were close relatives of the dinosaurs (and sometimes mistakenly considered dinosaurs by laymen), and reached enormous sizes, with some of the last forms being the largest flying animals ever to inhabit the Earth, having wingspans of over 9.1&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft). However, they spanned a large range of sizes, down to a 250&amp;nbsp;mm (10&amp;nbsp;in) wingspan in ''[[Nemicolopterus]]''.

[[Bird flight#Evolution of bird flight|Birds]] have an extensive fossil record, along with many forms documenting both their evolution from small theropod dinosaurs and the numerous bird-like forms of theropod which did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Indeed, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is arguably the most famous transitional fossil in the world, both due to its mix of reptilian and avian anatomy and the luck of being discovered only two years after Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. However, the ecology and this transition is considerably more contentious, with various scientists supporting either a "trees down" origin (in which an arboreal ancestor evolved gliding, then flight) or a "ground up" origin (in which a fast-running terrestrial ancestor used wings for a speed boost and to help catch prey).

[[Bat]]s are the most recent to evolve (about 60 million years ago), most likely from a fluttering ancestor&lt;ref name="Kaplan2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though their poor fossil record has hindered more detailed study.

Only a few animals are known to have specialised in soaring: the larger of the extinct [[pterosaur]]s, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size is an advantage, as it allows them a low wing loading, that is a large wing areas relative to their weight, which maximizes lift.&lt;ref name="berkeleyenter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/enter.html | title=Vertebrate Flight |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soaring is very energetically efficient.

==Biomechanics==

===Gliding and parachuting===
During a free-fall with no aerodynamic forces, the object accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity as the object descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented at an angle to the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.

During gliding, lift plays an increased role. Like drag, lift is proportional to velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.

===Powered flight===
Unlike most air vehicles, in which the objects that generate lift (wings) and thrust (engine/propeller) are separate and the wings remained fixed, flying animals use their wings to generate both lift and thrust by moving them relative to the body. This has made the flight of organisms considerably harder to understand than that of vehicles, as it involves varying speeds, angles, orientations, areas, and flow patterns over the wings.

A [[Bird flight|bird]] or [[bat]] flying through the air at a constant speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This will generate lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. [[Pterosaur]] flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study.

[[Insect flight]] is considerably different, due to their small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Shizhao |last2=Zhang |first2=Xing |last3=He |first3=Guowei |last4=Liu |first4=Tianshu |title=Lift Enhancement by Dynamically Changing Wingspan in Forward Flapping Flight|date=Sep 2013|arxiv=1309.2726|doi=10.1063/1.4884130 |volume=26 |journal=Physics of Fluids |page=061903|bibcode=2014PhFl...26f1903W}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling [[leading edge]] [[vortex generator|vortex]].&lt;ref name="physics"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/lab/papers/jwang-arf05.pdf |title=DISSECTING INSECT FLIGHT |author=Wang, Z.

As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, at the price of wear and tear on the wings.&lt;ref name="physics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aerodynamics"/&gt;

==Limits and extremes==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

===Flying/soaring===
* Largest. The largest known flying animal was formerly thought to be ''[[Pteranodon]]'', a [[pterosaur]] with a wingspan of up to {{Convert|7.5|m}}. However, the more recently discovered [[azhdarchid]] pterosaur ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' is much larger, with estimates of the wingspan ranging from {{Convert|9|to|12|m}}. Some other recently discovered azhdarchid pterosaur species, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'', may have also wingspans of a similar size or even slightly larger. Although it is widely thought that ''Quetzalcoatlus'' reached the size limit of a flying animal, it should be noted that the same was once said of ''Pteranodon''. The heaviest living flying animals are the [[kori bustard]] and the [[great bustard]] with males reaching {{Convert|21|kg}}. The [[wandering albatross]] has the greatest wingspan of any living flying animal at {{Convert|3.63|m}}. Among living animals which fly over land, the [[Andean condor]] and the [[marabou stork]] have the largest wingspan at {{Convert|3.2|m}}. Studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that it is physically possible for flying animals to reach {{Convert|18|m|adj=on}} wingspans, but there is no firm evidence that any flying animal, not even the azhdarchid pterosaurs, got that large.
* Smallest. There is no real minimum size for getting airborne. Indeed, there are many bacteria floating in the atmosphere that constitute part of the [[aeroplankton]]. However, to move about under one's own power and not be overly affected by the wind requires a certain amount of size. The smallest flying vertebrates are the [[bee hummingbird]] and the [[bumblebee bat]], both of which may weigh less than {{Convert|2|g}}. They are thought to represent the lower size limit for [[endotherm (biology)|endotherm]] flight.
* Fastest. The fastest of all known flying animals is the [[peregrine falcon]], which when diving travels at {{Convert|300|km/h}} or faster. The fastest animal in flapping horizontal flight may be the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]], said to attain about {{convert|160|km/h}} based on ground speed by an aircraft tracking device;&lt;ref name=McCracken&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCracken, Gary F. |author2=Safi, Kamran |author3=Kunz, Thomas H. |author4=Dechmann, Dina K. N. |author5=Swartz, Sharon M. |author6=Wikelski, Martin |title=Airplane tracking documents the fastest flight speeds recorded for bats |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/11/160398 |journal=Royal Society Open Science |date=9 November 2016 |doi=10.1098/rsos.160398 |volume=3 |page=160398|bibcode=2016RSOS....360398M }}&lt;/ref&gt; that measurement does not separate any contribution from wind speed, so the observations could be caused by strong [[tailwind]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Photopoulos |first1=Julianna |title=Speedy bat flies at 160km/h, smashing bird speed record|journal=New Scientist |date=9 November 2016 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112044-speedy-bat-flies-at-160kmh-smashing-bird-speed-record/ |accessdate=11 November 2016 |quote=But not everyone is convinced. Graham Taylor at the University of Oxford says that errors in estimating bat speed by measuring the distance moved between successive positions could be huge. “So I think it would be premature to knock birds off their pedestal as nature's fastest fliers just yet,” he says."These bats are indeed flying very fast at times, but this is based on their ground speed," says Anders Hedenström at the University of Lund in Sweden. "Since they did not measure winds at the place and time where the bats are flying, one can therefore not exclude that the top speeds are not bats flying in a gust."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Slowest. Most flying animals need to travel forward to stay aloft. However, some creatures can stay in the same spot, known as hovering, either by rapidly flapping the wings, as do [[hummingbird]]s, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and some others, or carefully using thermals, as do some [[birds of prey]]. The slowest flying non-hovering bird recorded is the [[American woodcock]], at {{Convert|8|km/h}}.
* Highest flying. There are records of a [[Rüppell's vulture]] ''Gyps rueppelli'', a large vulture, being sucked into a jet engine {{Convert|11,550|m}} above [[Côte d'Ivoire]] in West Africa. The animal that flies highest most regularly is the [[bar-headed goose]] ''Anser indicus'', which [[Bird migration|migrate]]s directly over the [[Himalayas]] between its nesting grounds in [[Tibet]] and its winter quarters in [[India]]. They are sometimes seen flying well above the peak of [[Mount Everest]] at {{Convert|8,848|m}}.

===Gliding/parachuting===
* Most efficient glider. This can be taken as the animal that moves most horizontal distance per metre fallen. [[Flying squirrel]]s are known to glide up to {{Convert|200|m}}, but have measured [[glide ratio]] of about 2. [[Flying fish]] have been observed to glide for hundreds of metres on the drafts on the edge of waves with only their initial leap from the water to provide height, but may be obtaining additional lift from wave motion. On the other hand, [[albatross]]es have measured lift/drag ratios of 20,&lt;ref name=fili&gt;[http://www.sierrafoot.org/mather/fact_checks/lift_to_drag_ratios.html#table2 Fillipone]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus fall just 1 meter (foot) for every 20 in still air.
* Most maneuverable glider. Many gliding animals have some ability to turn, but which is the most maneuverable is difficult to assess. Even [[Chrysopelea paradisi|paradise tree snake]]s, [[Chinese gliding frog]]s, and [[gliding ant]]s have been observed as having considerable capacity to turn in the air.

==Extant flying and gliding animals==

===[[Invertebrates]]===

====[[Arthropods]]====
[[File:Beeinflightfromfront.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bee]] in flight.]]
* [[Insects]] (flying). The first of all animals to evolve flight, insects are also the only invertebrates that have evolved flight. The species are too numerous to list here. [[Insect flight]] is an active research field. 
** [[Gliding bristletail]]s (gliding). Directed aerial gliding descent is found in some tropical arboreal [[Archaeognatha|bristletails]], an ancestrally wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The bristletails median caudal filament is important for the [[glide ratio]] and gliding control &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yanoviak | first1=SP | last2=Kaspari | first2=M | last3=Dudley | first3=R | year=2009 | title=Gliding hexapods and the origins of insect aerial behaviour | url=| journal=Biology Letters | volume=5 | issue=4| pages=510–2 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0029 | pmid=19324632 | pmc=2781901}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Gliding ant]]s (gliding). The flightless workers of these insects have secondarily gained some capacity to move through the air. Gliding has evolved independently in a number of arboreal ant species from the groups [[Cephalotini]], [[Pseudomyrmecinae]], and [[Formicinae]] (mostly ''[[Camponotus]]''). All arboreal [[dolichoderine]]s and non-cephalotine [[myrmicine]]s except ''[[Daceton armigerum]]'' do not glide. Living in the rainforest canopy like many other gliders, gliding ants use their gliding to return to the trunk of the tree they live on should they fall or be knocked off a branch. Gliding was first discovered for ''[[Cephalotes atreus]]'' in the [[Peru]]vian rainforest.

** Gliding immature insects. The wingless immature stages of some insect species that have wings as adults may also show a capacity to glide. These include some species of [[cockroach]], [[mantid]], [[katydid]], [[stick insect]] and [[true bug]]. [http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/skydiving-spiders-discovered-in-south-america-115082100793_1.html]
* [[Spiders]]. Although typically flightless some may engage in aerial locomotion as described below.
**[[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning spiders]] (parachuting). The young of some species of spiders travel through the air by using silk draglines to catch the wind, as may some smaller species of adult spider, such the [[money spider]] family. This behavior is commonly known as "ballooning". [[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning spiders]] make up part of the [[aeroplankton]].
** [[Gliding spiders]] (gliding). Some species of arboreal spider of the genus ''[[Selenops]]'' can glide back to the trunk of a tree should they fall. [http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/skydiving-spiders-discovered-in-south-america-115082100793_1.html]

====[[Molluscs]]====
* [[Flying squid]] (gliding). Several oceanic [[squids]], such as the [[Todarodes pacificus|Pacific flying squid]], will leap out of the water to escape predators, an adaptation similar to that of [[flying fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Packard|first=A.|title=Cephalopods and fish: the limits of convergence |journal=Biological Reviews |date=1972 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=241–307 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1972.tb00975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller squids will fly in shoals, and have been observed to cover distances as long as {{Convert|50|m}}. Small fins towards the back of the mantle do not produce much lift, but do help stabilize the motion of flight. They exit the water by expelling water out of their funnel, indeed some squid have been observed to continue jetting water while airborne providing thrust even after leaving the water. This may make flying squid the only animals with jet-propelled aerial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Maciá | first1=Silvia | last2=Robinson | first2=Michael P. | last3=Craze | first3=Paul | last4=Dalton | first4=Robert | last5=Thomas | first5=James D. | date=2004 | title=New observations on airborne jet propulsion (flight) in squid, with a review of previous reports | url=http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/3/297.full.pdf+html | journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies | volume=70 | issue=3| pages=297–299 | doi=10.1093/mollus/70.3.297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neon flying squid]] has been observed to glide for distances over {{Convert|30|m|4=-1}}, at speeds of up to {{Convert|11.2|m/s}} [http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/it-bird-it-plane-no-its-squid].

===[[Vertebrates]]===

====[[Fish]]====
[[File:Band-wing flyingfish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cheilopogon|Band-winged flying fish]], with enlarged [[pectoral fin]]s]]
* [[Flying fish]] (gliding). There are over 50 [[species]] of flying [[fish]] belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Exocoetidae]]. They are mostly [[marine (ocean)|marine]] fishes of small to medium size. The largest flying fish can reach lengths of {{Convert|45|cm}} but most species measure less than {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} in length. They can be divided into two-winged varieties and four-winged varieties. Before the fish leaves the water it increases its speed to around 30 body lengths per second and as it breaks the surface and is freed from the drag of the water it can be traveling at around {{Convert|60|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The glides are usually up to {{Convert|30|-|50|m|-1}} in length, but some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres using the updraft on the leading edges of waves. The fish can also make a series of glides, each time dipping the tail into the water to produce forward thrust. The longest recorded series of glides, with the fish only periodically dipping its tail in the water, was for 45 seconds (Video here &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7410421.stm BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Fast flying fish glides by ferry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). It has been suggested that the genus ''[[Exocoetus]]'' is on an evolutionary borderline between flight and gliding. It flaps its enlarged [[pectoral fin]]s when airborne, but still seems only to glide, as there is no hint of a power stroke.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/gliding.html | title=Vertebrate Flight: gliding and parachuting |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that some flying fish can glide as effectively as some flying birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-flying-fish-20100911,0,2807712.story Flying fish perform as well as some birds - Los Angeles Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Halfbeak]]s (gliding). A group related to the Exocoetidae, one or two hemirhamphid species possess enlarged pectoral fins and show true gliding flight rather than simple leaps. Marshall (1965) reports that ''[[Euleptorhamphus viridis]]'' can cover {{Convert|50|m}} in two separate hops.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, N.B. (1965) The Life of Fishes. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. 402 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Freshwater butterflyfish]] (possibly gliding). ''Pantodon buchholzi'' has the ability to jump and possibly glide a short distance. It can move through the air several times the length of its body. While it does this, the fish flaps its large pectoral fins, giving it its common name.&lt;ref&gt;Berra, Tim M. (2001). ''Freshwater Fish Distribution''. San Diego: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-093156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is debated whether the freshwater butterfly fish can truly glide, Saidel et al. (2004) argue that it cannot.
* [[Freshwater hatchetfish]] (possibly flying). There are 9 species of freshwater hatchetfish split among 3 genera. Freshwater hatchetfish have an extremely large sternal region that is fitted with a large amount of muscle that allows it to flap its pectoral fins. They can move in a straight line over a few metres to escape predators {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.

====[[Amphibians]]====
Gliding has evolved independently in two families of tree frogs, the [[Old World]] Rhacophoridae and the [[New World]] Hylidae. Within each lineage there are a range of gliding abilities from non-gliding, to parachuting, to full gliding.
* [[Rhacophoridae]] [[flying frog]]s (gliding). A number of the Rhacophoridae, such as [[Wallace's flying frog]] (''Rhacophorus nigropalmatus''), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being enlarged toe membranes. For example, the [[Malayan flying frog]] ''Rhacophorus prominanus'' glides using the membranes between the toes of its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, the base of the leg, and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the [[Chinese flying frog]] ''Rhacophorus dennysi'' can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either [[flight dynamics|roll]]ing into the turn (a [[banked turn]]) or [[flight dynamics|yaw]]ing into the turn (a [[crabbed turn]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McKay | first1=M.

[[File:Ptychozoon kuhli underside cropped.JPG|thumb|right|The underside of [[Ptychozoon kuhli|Kuhl's flying gecko]] ''[[Ptychozoon kuhli]]''. Note the gliding adaptations: flaps of skin on the legs, feet, sides of the body, and on the sides of the head.]]

====[[Reptiles]]====
Several lizards and snakes are capable of gliding:

* [[Draco lizard|''Draco'' lizards]]. There are 28 species of [[lizard]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Draco lizard|Draco]]'', found in [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. They live in trees, feeding on tree ants, but nest on the forest floor. They can glide for up to {{Convert|60|m}} and over this distance they lose only {{Convert|10|m|4=-1}} in height.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"/&gt; Unusually, their patagium (gliding membrane) is supported on elongated ribs rather than the more common situation among gliding [[vertebrate]]s of having the patagium attached to the limbs. When extended, the ribs form a semicircle on either side the lizard's body and can be folded to the body like a folding fan.
* [[Holaspis|Gliding lacertid]]s. There are two species of gliding [[lacertid]], of the genus ''[[Holaspis]]'', found in [[Africa]]. They have fringed toes and tail sides and can flatten their bodies for gliding/parachuting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8150000/8150333.stm Tiny lizard falls like a feather]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ptychozoon|''Ptychozoon'' flying gecko]]s. There are six species of gliding gecko, of the genus ''[[Ptychozoon]]'', from Southeast Asia. These lizards have small flaps of skin along their limbs, torso, tail, and head that catch the air and enable them to glide.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs1"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/06/ptychozoon_parachute_geckos.php Ptychozoon: the geckos that glide with flaps and fringes (gekkotans part VIII) – Tetrapod Zoology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luperosaurus|''Lupersaurus'' flying gecko]]s. A possible sister-taxon to ''Ptychozoon'' which has similar flaps and folds and also glides.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs1"/&gt;
* [[Thecadactylus|''Thecadactylus'' flying gecko]]s. At least some species of ''Thecadactylus'', such as ''T. rapicauda'', are known to glide.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs1"/&gt;
* [[Cosymbotus|''Cosymbotus'' flying gecko]]. Similar adaptations to ''Ptychozoon'' are found in the two species of the gecko genus ''[[Cosymbotus]]''.
* ''[[Chrysopelea]]'' snakes. Five species of snake from Southeast Asia, [[Melanesia]], and [[India]]. The [[paradise tree snake]] of southern [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Borneo]], [[Philippines]], and [[Sulawesi]] is the most capable glider of those snakes studied. It glides by stretching out its body sideways and opening its ribs so the belly is concave, and by making lateral slithering movements. It can remarkably glide up to {{Convert|100|m}} and make 90 degree turns.

====[[Birds]]====
{{Main|Bird flight}}
[[File:Flying mallard duck - female.jpg|thumb|right|Birds are a successful group of flying vertebrate.]]
* [[Bird]]s (flying, soaring) — Most of the approximately 10,000 living species can fly ([[flightless bird]]s are the exception). Bird flight is one of the most studied forms of aerial locomotion in animals. See [[List of soaring birds]] for birds that can soar as well as fly.

====[[Mammals]]====
[[Bat]]s are the only mammal with flapping or powered [[Bat flight|flight]].  A few other mammals glide or parachute; the best known are [[flying squirrel]]s and [[Colugo|flying lemur]]s.

* [[Bat]]s (flying). There are approximately 1,240 bat species, representing about 20% of all classified mammal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tudge | first=Colin | title=The Variety of Life | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2000 | isbn=0-19-860426-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flying squirrel]]s (subfamily [[Petauristinae]]) (gliding). There are 43 species divided between 14 genera of flying [[squirrel]]. Flying squirrels are found almost worldwide in tropical ([[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], and [[Sri Lanka]]), temperate, and even [[Arctic]] environments. They tend to be [[nocturnal]]. When a flying squirrel wishes to cross to a tree that is further away than the distance possible by jumping, it extends the cartilage spur on its elbow or wrist. This opens out the flap of furry skin (the [[patagium]]) that stretches from its wrist to its ankle. It glides spread-eagle and with its tail fluffed out like a parachute, and grips the tree with its claws when it lands. Flying squirrels have been reported to glide over {{Convert|200|m}}.
* [[Anomalure]]s or scaly-tailed flying squirrels (family [[Anomaluridae]]) (gliding). These brightly coloured African rodents are not squirrels but have evolved to a resemble flying squirrels by [[convergent evolution]]. There are seven species, divided in three genera. All but one species have gliding membranes between their front and hind legs. The genus ''Idiurus'' contains two particularly small species known as [[flying mice]], but similarly they are not true mice.
* [[Colugo]]s or "flying lemurs" (order [[Dermoptera]]) (gliding). There are two species of colugo. Despite their common name, colugos are not [[lemur]]s; true lemurs are [[primate]]s. Molecular evidence suggests that colugos are a [[sister group]] to primates; however, some mammalogists suggest they are a sister group to [[bat]]s. Found in Southeast Asia, the colugo is probably the mammal most adapted for gliding, with a patagium that is as large as geometrically possible. They can glide as far as {{Convert|70|m}} with minimal loss of height.
* [[Sifaka]], a type of lemur, and possibly some other primates (possible limited gliding/parachuting). A number of primates have been suggested to have adaptations that allow limited gliding and/or parachuting: sifakas, [[indri]]s, [[galago]]s and [[saki monkey]]s. Most notably, the sifaka, a type of [[lemur]], has thick hairs on its forearms that have been argued to provide drag, and a small membrane under its arms that has been suggested to provide lift by having aerofoil properties.&lt;ref name="darrennaish.blogspot.com"&gt;[http://darrennaish.blogspot.com/2006/09/literally-flying-lemurs-and-not.html Darren Naish: Tetrapod Zoology: Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/08/literally_flying_lemurs.php Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans) – Tetrapod Zoology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816034946/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/08/literally_flying_lemurs.php |date=16 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flying phalanger]]s or wrist-winged gliders (subfamily [[Petaurinae]]) (gliding). Possums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/GlidingPossums.htm Gliding Possums] &amp;mdash; Environment, New South Wales Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Leonard &amp;mdash; "''Key Guide to Australian Mammals''", published by Reed Books Pty.

Ltd., Sydney, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; found in [[Australia]], and [[New Guinea]]. The [[Patagium|gliding membranes]] are hardly noticeable until they jump. On jumping, the animal extends all four legs and stretches the loose folds of skin. The subfamily contains seven species. Of the six species in the genus ''[[Petaurus]]'', the [[sugar glider]] and the [[Biak glider]] are the most common species. The lone species in the genus ''[[Gymnobelideus]]'', [[Leadbeater's possum]] has only a vestigial gliding membrane.
* [[Petauroides volans|Greater glider]] (''Petauroides volans'') (gliding). The only species of the genus ''[[Petauroides]]'' of the family [[Pseudocheiridae]]. This [[marsupial]] is found in [[Australia]], and was originally classed with the flying phalangers, but is now recognised as separate. Its flying membrane only extends to the elbow, rather than to the wrist as in [[Petaurinae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Myers | first=Phil | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pseudocheiridae.html | title=Family Pseudocheiridae |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Acrobatidae|Feather-tailed possum]]s (family [[Acrobatidae]]) (gliding). This family of [[marsupials]] contains two genera, each with one species. The [[feathertail glider]] (''Acrobates pygmaeus''), found in [[Australia]] is the size of a very small mouse and is the smallest mammalian glider. The [[feathertail possum]] (''Distoechurus pennatus'') is found in [[New Guinea]], but does not glide. Both species have a stiff-haired feather-like tail.

==Extinct flying and gliding animals==
[[File:Coloborhynchus piscator jconway.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pterosaur]]s included the largest known flying animals]]

===Reptiles===
* Extinct reptiles similar to ''Draco'' (gliding). There are a number of unrelated extinct lizard-like reptiles with similar "wings" to the ''Draco ''lizards. ''[[Icarosaurus]]'', ''[[Coelurosauravus]]'', ''[[Weigeltisaurus]]''&lt;!-- Palaeontology28:413 --&gt;, ''[[Mecistotrachelos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/animals/070612_gliding_reptile.html Ancient Gliding Reptile Discovered | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kuehneosaurus]]''. The largest of these, ''Kuehneosaurus'', has a wingspan of {{Convert|30|cm}}, and was estimated to be able to glide about {{Convert|30|m|sigfig=1}}.
* [[Sharovipterygidae]] (gliding). These strange reptiles from the Upper [[Triassic]] of Kyrgyzstan and [[Poland]] unusually had a membrane on their elongated hind limbs, extending their otherwise normal, [[flying-squirrel]]-like patagia significantly. The forelimbs are in contrast much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=J. | last1=Dzik | first2=Tomasz | last2=Sulej | title=An early Late Triassic long-necked reptile with a bony pectoral shield and gracile appendages | volume=64 | issue=4 | journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | pages=805–823 | year=2016 | url=https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app002762016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Longisquama insignis]]'' (possibly gliding/parachuting). This small reptile may have had long paired feather-like scales on its back, however it has been more recently argued that the scales form just a single dorsal frill. If paired, they may have been used for parachuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Stauth | first=David | url=http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~rwhitmor/ornithology/Ancient%20feathered%20animal%20challenges%20dinosaur-bird%20link.htm | title=Ancient feathered animal challenges dinosaur-bird link | date=2000 | accessdate=15 April 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611055757/http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~rwhitmor/ornithology/Ancient%20feathered%20animal%20challenges%20dinosaur-bird%20link.htm | archivedate=11 June 2004 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/longisquama.html | title=Controversial Fossil Claimed to Sink Dinosaur-Bird Link |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630141141/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/longisquama.html|archivedate=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Everything you can make out is consistent with it being a small, tree-living, gliding animal, which is precisely the thing you'd expect birds to evolve out of," says Larry Martin, senior curator at the Natural History Museum at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/19479/ Dinosaur Profs Worlds Apart on Link to Birds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Pterosaur]]s (flying). Pterosaurs were the first flying vertebrates, and are generally agreed to have been sophisticated flyers. They had large wings formed by a [[patagium]] stretching from the torso to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. There were hundreds of species, most of which are thought to have been intermittent flappers, and many soarers. The largest known flying animals are pterosaurs.
* ''[[Hypuronector]]'' (gliding). This bizarre drepanosaur displays limb proportions, particularly the elongated forelimbs, that are consistent with a flying or gliding animal with [[patagia]].&lt;ref&gt;Renesto, S., Spielmann, J. A., Lucas, S. G., &amp; Spagnoli, G. T. (2010).

New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-avian dinosaurs===
* [[Theropod]]s (gliding/flying). There were several species of theropod [[dinosaur]] thought to be capable of gliding or flying, that are not classified as birds (though they are closely related). Some species (''[[Microraptor]] gui'', ''Microraptor zhaoianus'', ''[[Cryptovolans pauli]]'', and ''[[Changyuraptor]]'') have been found that were fully feathered on all four limbs, giving them four 'wings' that they are believed to have used for gliding or flying. One species, ''[[Deinonychus|Deinonychus antirrhopus]]'', may display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight while the adults are flightless, a characteristic also seen in some modern birds like the [[Horned coot]] and the [[Flying steamer duck]].
* ''[[Yi (dinosaur)|Yi]]'' is unique among gliding dinosaurs for the development of membranous wings, unlike the feathered airfoils of other theropods. Much like modern anomalures it developed a bony rod to help support the wing, albeit on the wrist and not the elbow.

===Fish===
* [[Thoracopteridae]] (gliding) is a lineage of [[Triassic]] [[flying fish]]-like [[Perleidiformes]], having converted their pectoral and pelvic fins into broad wings very similar to those of their modern counterparts. The [[Ladinian]] genus ''[[Potanichthys]]'' is the oldest member of this clade, as well as the earliest aerial vertebrate known, suggesting that these fish began exploring aerial niches soon after the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]].

===Mammals===
[[File:Volaticotherium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Volaticotheridae|Volaticotherids]] predate bats as mammalian aeronauts by at least 110 million years]]

The '''fusion energy gain factor''', usually expressed with the symbol '''''Q''''', is the ratio of [[fusion power]] produced in a [[nuclear fusion]] reactor to the power required to maintain the [[Plasma physics|plasma]]  in [[steady state]]. The condition of ''Q'' = 1, when the power being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is referred to as '''breakeven'''.

The power given off by the fusion reactions may be captured within the fuel, leading to ''self-heating''. Most fusion reactions release at least some of their energy in a form that cannot be captured within the plasma, so a system at ''Q'' = 1 will cool without external heating. With typical fuels, self-heating in fusion reactors is not expected to match the external sources until at least ''Q'' = 5. If ''Q'' increases past this point, increasing self-heating eventually removes the need for external heating. At this point the reaction becomes self-sustaining, a condition called '''ignition'''. Ignition corresponds to infinite ''Q'', and is generally regarded as highly desirable for a practical reactor design.

Over time, several related terms have entered the fusion lexicon. As a reactor does not cover its own heating losses until about ''Q'' = 5, the term '''engineering breakeven''' is sometimes used to describe a reactor that produces enough electricity to provide that heating. Above engineering breakeven a machine would produce more electricity than it uses, and could sell that excess. A machine that can sell enough electricity to cover its operating costs, estimated to require at least ''Q'' = 20, is sometimes known as '''economic breakeven'''.

{{Asof|2017}}, the record for ''Q'' is held by the [[Joint European Torus|JET]] tokamak in the UK, at ''Q'' = (16 MW)/(24 MW) ≈ 0.67, first attained in 1997. [[ITER]] was originally designed to reach ignition, but is currently designed to reach ''Q'' = 10, producing 500&amp;nbsp;MW of fusion power from 50&amp;nbsp;MW of injected thermal power.

==Concept==
''Q'' is simply the comparison of the [[Fusion power|power]] being released by the fusion reactions in a reactor, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, to the constant heating power being supplied, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;. However, there are several definitions of breakeven that consider additional power losses.

===Breakeven===
In 1955, [[John D. Lawson (scientist)|John Lawson]] was the first to explore the energy balance mechanisms in detail, initially in classified works but published openly in a now-famous 1957 paper. In this paper he considered and refined work by earlier researchers, notably [[Hans Thirring]], [[Peter Thonemann]], and a review article by [[Richard Post]]. Expanding on all of these, Lawson's paper made detailed predictions for the amount of power that would be lost through various mechanisms, and compared that to the energy needed to sustain the reaction.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} This balance is today known as the [[Lawson criterion]].

In a successful fusion reactor design, the fusion reactions generate an amount of power designated ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.{{efn|This was denoted ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; in Lawson's original paper, but changed here to match modern terminology.}} Some amount of this energy, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;, is lost through a variety of mechanisms, mostly convection of the fuel to the walls of the reactor chamber and various forms of radiation that cannot be captured to generate power. In order to keep the reaction going, the system has to provide heating to make up for these losses, where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; to maintain thermal equilibrium.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|pp=8-9}}

The most basic definition of breakeven is when ''Q'' = 1,{{efn|In Lawson's original paper, the term ''Q'' was used to denote the total energy released by the individual fusion reactions, in MeV, and ''R'' referred to the power balance.{{sfn|Lawson|1957|p=6}} Later works used ''Q'' to refer to the power balance, as it is used in this article.}} that is, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;.

Some works refer to this definition as '''scientific breakeven''', to contrast it with similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Nuclear Society |url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/fst/a_22885 |title= The Mirror Fusion Test Facility: An Intermediate Device to a Mirror Fusion Reactor  |first=V. N. |last=Karpenko |volume=4 |number=2P2 |date=September 1983 |doi=10.13182/FST83-A22885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title= 17th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/event/rcn/9860_en.html | date =19 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage is rare outside certain areas, specifically the [[inertial confinement fusion]] field, where the term is much more widely used.

===Extrapolated breakeven===
Since the 1950s, most commercial fusion reactor designs have been based on a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] as their primary fuel; others fuels have been studied for a variety of reasons but are much harder to ignite. As tritium is radioactive, highly bioactive and highly mobile, it represents a significant safety concern and adds to the cost of designing and operating such a reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |url=https://thebulletin.org/2017/04/fusion-reactors-not-what-theyre-cracked-up-to-be/ |title=Fusion reactors: Not what they’re cracked up to be |date=19 April 2017 |first=Daniel |last=Jassby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to lower costs, many experimental machines are designed to run on test fuels of hydrogen or deuterium alone, leaving out the tritium. In this case, the term '''extrapolated breakeven''' is used to define the expected performance of the machine running on D-T fuel based on the performance when running on hydrogen or deuterium alone.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ees.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~web_dai5/english/B.html |title=Plasma Dictionary |website=Nagoya University |first= M. A. |last=Razzak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records for extrapolated breakeven are slightly higher than the records for scientific breakeven. Both JET and JT-60 have reached values around 1.25 (see below for details) while running on D-D fuel. When running on D-T, only possible in JET, the maximum performance is about half the extrapolated value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

===Engineering breakeven===
Another related term, '''engineering breakeven''', considers the need to extract the energy from the reactor, turn that into electrical energy, and feed that back into the heating system.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This closed loop is known as ''recirculation''. In this case, the basic definition changes by adding additional terms to the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; side to consider the efficiencies of these processes.

Most fusion reactions release energy in a variety of forms, mostly [[neutron]]s and a variety of charged particles like [[alpha particle]]s. Neutrons are electrically neutral and will travel out of any [[magnetic confinement fusion]] (MFE) design, and in spite of the very high densities found in [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) designs, they tend to easily escape the fuel mass in these designs as well. This means that only the charged particles from the reactions can be captured within the fuel mass and give rise to self-heating. If the fraction of the energy being released in the charged particles is ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, then the power in these particles is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. If this self-heating process is perfect, that is, all of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; is captured in the fuel, that means the power available for generating electricity is the power that is not released in that form, or (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the case of neutrons carrying most of the practical energy, as is the case in the D-T fuel studied in most designs, this neutron energy is normally captured in a "blanket" of  [[lithium]] that produces more tritium that is used to fuel the reactor. Due to various [[exothermic]] and [[endothermic]] reactions, the blanket may have a power gain factor a few percent higher or lower than 100%, but that will be neglected here. The blanket is then cooled and the [[cooling fluid]] used in a [[heat exchanger]] driving conventional [[steam turbine]]s. These have an efficiency η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; which is around 35 to 40%.

Consider a system that uses external heaters to heat the fusion fuel, then extracts the power from those reactions to generate electrical power. Some fraction of that power, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;, is needed to recirculate back into the heaters to close the loop. This is not the same as the ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; because the self-heating processes are providing some of the required energy. While the system as a whole requires additional power for building climate control, lighting, and the confinement system, these are generally much smaller than the plasma heating system requirements.
 
Considering all of these factors, the heating power can thus be related to the fusion power by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;P_{heat} = \eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})\cdot P_{fus}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency that power supplied to the heating systems is turned into heat in the fuel, as opposed to lost in the equipment itself, and &lt;math&gt;\eta_{elec}&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency achieved when turning the heat into electrical power, for instance, through the [[Rankine cycle]].

The fusion energy gain factor is then defined as:

&lt;math&gt; Q_E \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat}} = \frac{1}{\eta_{heat} \cdot f_{recirc}\cdot  \eta_{elec}\cdot  (1-f_{ch})} &lt;/math&gt;

===Ignition===
As the temperature of the plasma increases, the rate of fusion reactions grows rapidly, and with it, the rate of self heating. In contrast, the non-capturable energy losses like x-rays do not grow at the same rate. Thus, in overall terms, the self-heating process becomes more efficient as the temperature increases, and less energy is needed from external sources to keep it hot.

Eventually ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; reaches zero, that is, all of the energy needed to keep the plasma at the operational temperature is being supplied by self-heating, and the amount of external energy that needs to be added drops to zero. This point is known as '''ignition'''.

Ignition, by definition, corresponds to an infinite ''Q'', but it does not mean that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; drops to zero as the other power sinks in the system, like the magnets and cooling systems, still need to be powered. Generally, however, these are much smaller than the energy in the heaters, and require a much smaller ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt;. More importantly, this number is more likely to be near constant, meaning that further improvements in plasma performance will result in more energy that can be directly used for commercial generation, as opposed to recirculation.

===Commercial breakeven===
The final definition of breakeven is '''commercial breakeven''', which occurs when the economic value of any net energy left over after recirculation is enough to finance the construction of the reactor.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; This value depends both on the reactor and the [[spot price]] of electrical power.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Glossary |website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial breakeven relies on factors outside the technology of the reactor itself, and it is possible that even a reactor with a fully ignited plasma will not generate enough energy to pay for itself. Whether any of the mainline concepts like [[ITER]] can reach this goal is being debated in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://issues.org/31-4/fusion-research-time-to-set-a-new-path/ |title=Fusion Research: Time to Set a New Path |first=Robert |last=Hirsch |date=Summer 2015 |magazine=Issues in Technology |volume=31 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical example==
Most fusion reactor designs being studied {{asof|2017|lc=yes}} are based on the D-T reaction, as this is by far the easiest to ignite, and is energy dense. However, this reaction also gives off most of its energy in the form of a single highly energetic neutron, and only 20% of the energy in the form of an alpha. Thus, for the D-T reaction, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2. This means that self-heating does not become equal to the external heating until at least ''Q'' = 5. 

Efficiency values depend on design details but may be in the range of η&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.7 (70%) and η&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.4 (40%). The purpose of a fusion reactor is to produce power, not to recirculate it, so a practical reactor must have ''f''&lt;sub&gt;recirc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2 approximately. Lower would be better but will be hard to achieve. Using these values we find for a practical reactor ''Q'' = 22.

==Transient vs. continual==
Many early fusion devices operated for microseconds, using some sort of pulsed power source to feed their [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetic confinement]] system and used the confinement as the heating source. Lawson defined breakeven in this context as the total energy released by the entire reaction cycle compared to the total energy supplied to the machine during the same cycle.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Over time, as performance increased by orders of magnitude, the reaction times have extended from microseconds to seconds, and in [[ITER]], on the order of minutes. In this case definition of "the entire reaction cycle" becomes blurred. In the case of an ignited plasma, for instance, P&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; may be quite high while the system is being set up, and then drop to zero when it is fully developed, so one may be tempted to pick an instant in time when it is operating at its best to determine ''Q''. A better solution in these cases is to use the original Lawson definition averaged over the reaction to produce a similar value as the original definition.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

However, there is a complication. During the heating phase when the system is being brought up to operational conditions, some of the energy released by the fusion reactions will be used to heat the surrounding fuel, and thus not be released. This is no longer true when the plasma reaches its operational temperature and enters thermal equilibrium. Thus, if one averages over the entire cycle, this energy will be included as part of the heating term, that is, some of the energy that was captured for heating would otherwise have been released in P&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; and is therefore not indicative of an operational ''Q''.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Operators of the JET reactor argued that this input should be removed from the total:

&lt;math&gt; Q* \equiv \frac{P_{fus}}{P_{heat} - P_{temp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt; P_{temp} = \frac{dWp}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, P&lt;sub&gt;temp&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of energy needed to raise the internal energy of the plasma. It is this definition that was used when reporting JET's record 0.67 value.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

Some debate over this definition continues. In 1998, the operators of the [[JT-60]] claimed to have reached ''Q'' = 1.25 running on D-D fuel, thus reaching extrapolated breakeven. However, this measurement was based on the JET definition of Q*. Using this definition, JET had also reached extrapolated breakeven some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |title=JT-60U Reaches 1.25 of Equivalent Fusion Power Gain |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106002827/http://www-jt60.naka.jaea.go.jp/english/html/exp_rep/rep46.html |archive-date=6 January 2013 |date=7 August 1998 |accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one considers the energy balance in these conditions, and the analysis of previous machines, it is argued the original definition should be used, and thus both machines remain well below break-even of any sort.{{sfn|Meade|1997}}

==Scientific breakeven at NIF==
Although most fusion experiments use some form of magnetic confinement, another major branch is [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) that mechanically presses together the fuel mass (the "target") to increase its density. This greatly increases the rate of fusion events and lowers the need to confine the fuel for long periods. This compression is accomplished by heating a lightweight capsule holding the fuel so rapidly that it explodes outwards, driving the fuel mass on the inside inward in accordance with [[Newton's third law]]. There are a variety of proposed "drivers" to cause the implosion process, but to date most experiments have used [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://kfe.fjfi.cvut.cz/~limpouch/plazma/Pfalzner_Introduction_ICF.pdf |title=An Introduction to Inertial Confinement Fusion |first=S. |last=Pfalzner |publisher=CRC Press |date=2006 |pages=13-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using the traditional definition of ''Q'', ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;, ICF devices have extremely low ''Q''. This is because the laser is extremely inefficient; whereas &lt;math&gt;\eta_{heat}&lt;/math&gt; for the heaters used in magnetic systems might be on the order of 70%, lasers are on the order of 1.5%. For this reason, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the leader in ICF research, has proposed another modification of ''Q'' that defines ''P''&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt; as the energy delivered by the driver, as opposed to the energy put into the driver. This definition produces much higher ''Q'' values, and changes the definition of breakeven to be ''P''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; / ''P''&lt;sub&gt;laser&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. On occasion, they referred to this definition as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |title=Status of the NIF Project |first=Edward |last=Moses |date=4 May 2007 |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Optics |first=H.

[[File:Red Giant Earth warm.jpg|thumb|274x274px|alt=A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun|Conjectured illustration of the scorched [[Earth]] after the [[Sun]] has entered the [[red giant]] phase, about 7 billion years from now.&lt;ref name=apj418/&gt;]]

The biological and geological '''future of Earth''' can be [[Extrapolation|extrapolated]] based upon the estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at [[Earth]]'s surface, the rate of [[Thermal history of the Earth|cooling of the planet's interior]], the [[perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational interactions]] with other objects in the [[Solar System]], and a steady increase in the [[solar luminosity|Sun's luminosity]]. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as [[climate engineering]],&lt;ref name=aree25_245/&gt; which could cause significant changes to the planet.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas104_31/&gt; The current [[Holocene extinction]]&lt;ref name=pnas98_1/&gt; is being caused by technology{{sfn|Myers|2000|pp=63–70}} and the effects may last for up to five million years.{{sfn|Reaka-Kudla|Wilson|Wilson|1997|pp=132–33}} In turn, technology may result in the [[extinction of humanity]], leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

Over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years, random celestial events pose a global risk to the [[biosphere]], which can result in [[mass extinction]]s. These include impacts by [[comet]]s or [[asteroid]]s, and the possibility of a massive stellar explosion, called a [[supernova]], within a 100-[[light-year]] radius of the Sun. Other large-scale geological events are more predictable. [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] predicts that the planet will continue to undergo [[glacial period]]s at least until the [[Quaternary glaciation]] comes to an end. These periods are caused by variations in [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]], [[axial tilt]], and [[precession]] of the Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt; As part of the ongoing [[supercontinent cycle]], [[plate tectonics]] will probably result in a [[supercontinent]] in 250–350&amp;nbsp;million years. Some time in the next 1.5–4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years, the axial tilt of the Earth may begin to undergo chaotic variations, with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90°.&lt;ref name=aaa318/&gt;

The luminosity of the [[Sun]] will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in the [[solar radiation]] reaching the Earth. This will result in a higher rate of [[weathering]] of [[silicate mineral]]s, which will cause a decrease in the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere. In about 600&amp;nbsp;million years from now, the level of carbon dioxide will fall below the level needed to sustain [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation photosynthesis]] used by trees. Some plants use the [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]] method, allowing them to persist at carbon dioxide concentrations as low as 10 parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life, since plants are the base of the [[food chain]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt;

In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher than at present. This will cause the atmosphere to become a "moist greenhouse", resulting in a [[Positive feedback|runaway]] evaporation of the oceans. As a likely consequence, plate tectonics will come to an end, and with them the entire [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt; Following this event, in about 2−3 billion years, the planet's [[Dynamo theory|magnetic dynamo]] may cease, causing the [[magnetosphere]] to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of [[volatiles]] from the outer atmosphere. Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a [[runaway greenhouse effect]], heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Fishbaugh|Des_Marais|Korablev|Raulin|2007|p=114}} The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5&amp;nbsp;billion years, after the star has entered the [[red giant]] phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit.

== Human influence ==
{{Main|Conservation biology|Global warming|Human impact on the environment}}

Humans play a key role in the [[biosphere]], with the large [[human population]] dominating many of Earth's [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt; This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing [[mass extinction]] of other [[species]] during the present geological [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], now known as the [[Holocene extinction]]. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a [[biotic crisis]], with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007.{{sfn|Myers|2000|pp=63–70}} At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of [[extinction]] in the next hundred years.&lt;ref name=Novacek/&gt; The Holocene extinction event is the result of [[habitat destruction]], the widespread distribution of [[invasive species]], hunting, and [[climate change]].{{sfn|Cowie|2007|p=162}}&lt;ref name=nature04/&gt; In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=pnas104_31/&gt; The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Mooney/&gt;

The consequences of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last for at least five million years.{{sfn|Reaka-Kudla|Wilson|Wilson|1997|pp=132–33}} It could result in a decline in [[biodiversity]] and homogenization of [[biota (ecology)|biota]]s, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are [[Opportunism|opportunistic]], such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular [[taxa]] that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. [[Microorganism|Microbes]] are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large [[vertebrate]]s are likely to arise and [[food chains]] will probably be shortened.&lt;ref name=pnas98_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas01/&gt;

There are [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|multiple scenarios for known risks]] that can have a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and [[Human extinction|terminal risks]]. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the [[Grey goo|misuse of nanotechnology]], a [[nuclear holocaust]], warfare with a programmed [[superintelligence]], a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a [[Doomsday argument|doomsday]] threat, including a highly [[virulent]] disease, the [[Impact event|impact of an asteroid or comet]], [[runaway greenhouse effect]], and [[resource depletion]]. There may also be the possibility of an infestation by an [[extraterrestrial life]]form.&lt;ref name=telegraph20100410/&gt; The actual odds of these scenarios occurring are difficult if not impossible to deduce.&lt;ref name=bostrom2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

Should the human race become extinct, then the various features assembled by humanity will begin to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay [[half-life]] of about 1,000&amp;nbsp;years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the [[Giza Necropolis]] or the sculptures at [[Mount Rushmore]] may still survive in some form after a million years.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;{{efn|See also: [[Life After People]], about the decay of structures (if humans disappeared).}}

==Random events==
[[File:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Barringer Meteorite Crater]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], showing evidence of the impact of celestial objects upon the Earth]]
As the Sun orbits the [[Milky Way]], wandering stars may approach close enough to have a disruptive influence on the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=qjras35_1_1/&gt; A close stellar encounter may cause a significant reduction in the [[perihelion]] distances of comets in the [[Oort cloud]]&amp;mdash;a spherical region of icy bodies orbiting within half a [[light year]] of the Sun.&lt;ref name=aaa112_1_157/&gt; Such an encounter can trigger a 40-fold increase in the number of comets reaching the inner Solar System. Impacts from these comets can trigger a mass extinction of life on Earth. These disruptive encounters occur at an average of once every 45 million years.&lt;ref name=apjl499_L219/&gt; The mean time for the Sun to [[Stellar collision|collide]] with another star in the solar neighborhood is approximately {{nowrap|3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; years}}, which is much longer than the estimated age of the Milky Way galaxy, at {{nowrap|~1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years}}. This can be taken as an indication of the low likelihood of such an event occurring during the lifetime of the Earth.{{sfn|Tayler|1993|p=92}}

The energy release from the impact of an [[asteroid]] or comet with a diameter of {{convert|5|–|10|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger is sufficient to create a global [[environmental disaster]] and cause a [[statistically significant]] increase in the number of species extinctions. Among the deleterious effects resulting from a major impact event is a cloud of fine dust ejecta blanketing the planet, blocking some [[Diffuse sky radiation|direct sunlight]] from reaching the Earth's surface thus lowering land temperatures by about {{convert|15|C-change|F-change}} within a week and halting [[photosynthesis]] for several months (similar to a [[nuclear winter]]). The mean time between major impacts is estimated to be at least 100 million&amp;nbsp;years. During the last 540 million&amp;nbsp;years, simulations demonstrated that such an impact rate is sufficient to cause 5–6 mass extinctions and 20–30 lower severity events. This matches the geologic record of significant extinctions during the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. Such events can be expected to continue into the future.&lt;ref name=emp72_1_441/&gt;

A [[supernova]] is a cataclysmic explosion of a star. Within the Milky Way [[galaxy]], supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years.&lt;ref name=Tammann1004/&gt; During the [[History of Earth|history of the Earth]], multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years; known as a [[near-Earth supernova]]. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with [[radioisotope]]s and possibly impact the biosphere.&lt;ref name=nar48_1_119/&gt; [[Gamma ray]]s emitted by a supernova react with [[nitrogen]] in the atmosphere, producing [[nitrous oxide]]s. These molecules cause a depletion of the [[ozone layer]] that protects the surface from [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation from the Sun. An increase in [[UV-B]] radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the [[phytoplankton]] that form the base of the oceanic [[food chain]]. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26&amp;nbsp;light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32&amp;nbsp;light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries.{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|pp=174–76}} Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one [[gamma ray burst]] that will have a significant impact on the planet's biosphere.&lt;ref name=ass336_2_287/&gt;

The incremental effect of [[gravitational perturbation]]s between the planets causes the inner Solar System as a whole to behave [[Chaos theory|chaotically]] over long time periods. This does not significantly affect the [[stability of the Solar System]] over intervals of a few million years or less, but over billions of years the orbits of the planets become unpredictable. Computer simulations of the Solar System's evolution over the next five billion years suggest that there is a small (less than 1%) chance that a collision could occur between Earth and either [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], or [[Mars]].&lt;ref name=nature459_817/&gt;&lt;ref name=odp200906/&gt; During the same interval, the odds that the Earth will be scattered out of the Solar System by a passing star are on the order of one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. In such a scenario, the oceans would freeze solid within several million years, leaving only a few pockets of liquid water about {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} underground. There is a remote chance that the Earth will instead be captured by a passing [[binary star]] system, allowing the planet's biosphere to remain intact. The odds of this happening are about one chance in three million.{{sfn|Adams|2008|pp=33–44}}

==Orbit and rotation==
The gravitational perturbations of the other planets in the Solar System combine to modify the [[Earth's orbit|orbit of the Earth]] and the [[Earth's rotation|orientation of its spin axis]]. These changes can influence the planetary climate.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt;&lt;ref name=sci289_5486/&gt;{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|p=116}}{{sfn|Roberts|1998|p=60}}&lt;!-- This paragraph is a summary of the material below. --&gt; Despite such interactions, highly accurate simulations show that overall, Earth's orbit is likely to remain dynamically stable for billions of years into the future. In all 1,600 simulations, the planet's [[semimajor axis]], [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and [[orbital inclination|inclination]] remained nearly constant.&lt;ref name=Zeebe2015/&gt;

===Glaciation===
Historically, there have been cyclical [[ice age]]s in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in [[ocean circulation]] and [[continentality]] induced by [[plate tectonics]].{{sfn|Lunine|Lunine|1999|p=244}} The [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] predicts that [[glacial period]]s occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal [[orbital eccentricity]], a low [[axial tilt]] (or obliquity), and the alignment of [[summer solstice]] with the [[aphelion]].&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt; Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05.&lt;ref name=qsr10_4/&gt;&lt;ref name=maslin_ridgwell05/&gt; This is equivalent to a change of the [[semiminor axis]] of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the [[semimajor axis]] to 99.88%, respectively.&lt;ref name=weisstein03/&gt;

The Earth is passing through an ice age known as the [[quaternary glaciation]], and is presently in the [[Holocene]] [[interglacial period]]. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years.{{sfn|Roberts|1998|p=60}} However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the [[atmosphere]] by humans may delay the onset of the next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a [[global warming]] period of finite duration (based on the assumption that [[fossil fuel]] use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of [[greenhouse gas]] emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.&lt;ref name=cc79/&gt;

===Obliquity===
[[File:Tidal braking.svg|thumb|alt=A small gray circle at the top represents the Moon. A green circle centered in a blue ellipse represents the Earth and its oceans. A curved arrow shows the counterclockwise direction of the Earth's rotation, resulting in the long axis of the ellipse being slightly out of alignment with the Moon.|The rotational offset of the [[tidal bulge]] exerts a net [[torque]] on the Moon, boosting it while slowing the [[Earth's rotation]] (not to scale).]]

The [[tidal acceleration]] of the [[Moon]] slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the [[Earth-Moon distance]]. Friction effects—between the [[Inner core|core]] and [[Earth mantle|mantle]] and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase the [[Earth's rotation|length of the day]] by more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] by about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.&lt;ref name=aaa428/&gt;

Based on computer models, the presence of the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes.&lt;ref name=nature361/&gt; This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the [[precession]] rate of the Earth's spin axis, thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane (that is, the precession motion of the [[ecliptic]]).&lt;ref name=icarus168_2/&gt; However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.&lt;ref name=aaa318/&gt;

A high obliquity would probably result in dramatic changes in the climate and may destroy the planet's [[Planetary habitability|habitability]].{{sfn|Hanslmeier|2009|p=116}} When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly [[insolation]] at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for periods as long as 10&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=gsl29_23/&gt;

==Geodynamics==
[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|right|250px|thumb|alt=An irregular green shape against a blue background represents Pangaea.|[[Pangaea]] was the last [[supercontinent]] to form before the present.]]

[[Tectonics]]-based events will continue to occur well into the future and the surface will be steadily reshaped by [[tectonic uplift]], [[Extrusive|extrusions]], and [[erosion]]. [[Mount Vesuvius]] can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the [[San Andreas Fault]], while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. [[Mauna Loa]] should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the [[Old Faithful Geyser]] will likely cease to operate. The [[Niagara Falls]] will continue to retreat upstream, reaching [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in about 30,000&amp;ndash;50,000 years.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

In 10,000 years, the post-glacial rebound of the [[Baltic Sea]] will have reduced the depth by about {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Hudson Bay]] will decrease in depth by 100&amp;nbsp;m over the same period.&lt;ref name=odp200906/&gt; After 100,000 years, the island of [[Hawaii]] will have shifted about {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northwest. The planet may be entering another glacial period by this time.&lt;ref name=geo2_3_113/&gt;

===Continental drift===
{{Further|Continental drift}}
The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a [[hydrosphere]]. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt.&lt;ref name="pr114_1" /&gt; The production of [[Radiogenic heat|heat through radiogenic processes]] is sufficient to maintain [[mantle convection]] and plate [[subduction]] for at least the next 1.1 billion years.&lt;ref name="pr118" /&gt;

At present, the continents of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] are moving westward from [[Africa]] and [[Europe]]. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future.{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}} These [[geodynamic]] models can be distinguished by the [[subduction]] flux, whereby the [[oceanic crust]] moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, [[Atlantic ocean]] becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, [[Pacific ocean]] remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.&lt;ref name="gr15_3_4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science5859" /&gt;

As the understanding of [[geodynamics]] improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the [[mantle convection]] will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a [[supercontinent]] composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="pepi171_1_4" /&gt;

Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.&lt;ref name=hess5_4/&gt;

====Introversion====
[[File:PangeaUltimaRoughEstimation.png|right|thumb|350px|A rough approximation of [[Pangaea Ultima]], one of the three models for a future supercontinent.]]
[[Christopher Scotese]] and his colleagues have mapped out the predicted motions several hundred million years into the future as part of the [[Paleomap Project]].{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}} In their scenario, 50 million years from now the [[Mediterranean sea]] may vanish and the collision between Europe and Africa will create a long mountain range extending to the current location of the [[Persian Gulf]]. [[Australia]] will merge with [[Indonesia]], and [[Baja California]] will slide northward along the coast. New subduction zones may appear off the eastern coast of North and South America, and mountain chains will form along those coastlines. To the south, the migration of Antarctica to the north will cause all of [[Antarctic ice sheet|its ice sheets]] to melt. This, along with the melting of the [[Greenland ice sheet]]s, will raise the average ocean level by {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The inland flooding of the continents will result in climate changes.{{sfn|Ward|2006|pp=231–32}}

As this scenario continues, by 100 million years from the present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around the southern tip of Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called [[Pangaea Ultima]]), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the [[South Pole]], building up a new ice cap.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=92–96}}

====Extroversion====
The first scientist to extrapolate the current motions of the continents was Canadian geologist [[Paul F. Hoffman]] of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about [[Siberia]] until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, [[Amasia (continent)|Amasia]].{{sfn|Nield|2007|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Hoffman|1992|pp=323–27}} Later, in the 1990s, [[Roy Livermore]] calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and [[Madagascar]] would move across the [[Indian Ocean]] to collide with Asia.&lt;ref name=williams_nield/&gt;

In an extroversion model, the closure of the Pacific Ocean would be complete in about 350&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="U13B-08"/&gt; This marks the completion of the current [[supercontinent cycle]], wherein the continents split apart and then rejoin each other about every 400–500&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name=sa259_1/&gt; Once the supercontinent is built, plate tectonics may enter a period of inactivity as the rate of subduction drops by an [[order of magnitude]]. This period of stability could cause an increase in the mantle temperature at the rate of {{convert|30|-|100|C-change|F-change}} every 100&amp;nbsp;million years, which is the minimum lifetime of past supercontinents. As a consequence, [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] may increase.&lt;ref name=science5859/&gt;&lt;ref name="U13B-08"/&gt;

====Supercontinent====
The formation of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in [[Orogenic uplift|mountain building]], thereby shifting weather patterns. [[Sea level]]s may fall because of increased glaciation.{{sfn|Calkin|Young|1996|pp=9–75}} The rate of surface [[weathering]] can rise, resulting in an increase in the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid [[biological evolution]] as new [[Ecological niche|niches]] emerge.{{sfn|Thompson|Perry|1997|pp=127–28}}

The formation of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and the supercontinent will split up once more.{{sfn|Palmer|2003|p=164}} The planet may then experience a warming period, as occurred during the [[Cretaceous period]].{{sfn|Thompson|Perry|1997|pp=127–28}}

===Solidification of the outer core===
The iron-rich core region of the Earth is divided into a {{convert|1220|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius solid [[inner core]] and a {{convert|3480|km|mi|abbr=on}} radius liquid [[outer core]].&lt;ref name=gjl156_2_363/&gt; The rotation of the Earth creates convective eddies in the outer core region that cause it to function as a [[dynamo]].{{sfn|Gonzalez|Richards|2004|p=48}} This generates a [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetosphere]] about the Earth that deflects particles from the [[solar wind]], which prevents significant erosion of the atmosphere from [[sputtering]]. As heat from the core is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid outer core region to freeze, thereby releasing [[thermal energy]] and causing the solid inner core to grow.&lt;ref name=nature473_361/&gt; This iron [[crystallization]] process has been ongoing for about a billion years. In the modern era, the radius of the inner core is expanding at an average rate of roughly {{convert|0.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} per year, at the expense of the outer core.&lt;ref name=science328_5981_1014/&gt; Nearly all of the energy needed to power the dynamo is being supplied by this process of inner core formation.&lt;ref name=pepi110_1_83/&gt;

The growth of the inner core may be expected to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other [[Heavy metals|heavy elements]]. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing.{{sfn|Meadows|2007|p=34}} Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which may end the growth of the inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field of the Earth]] will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years.{{sfn|Stevenson|2002|p=605}} The loss of the [[magnetosphere]] will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly [[hydrogen]], from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life.&lt;ref name=ssr129_1_167/&gt;

== Solar evolution ==
{{see also|Stellar evolution|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}

The energy generation of the Sun is based upon [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]]. This occurs in the core region of the star using the [[proton–proton chain reaction]] process. Because there is no [[Convection zone|convection]] in the [[solar core]], the [[helium]] concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature at the core of the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the [[triple-alpha process]], so these atoms do not contribute to the net energy generation that is needed to maintain [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of the Sun.&lt;ref name=gough81/&gt;

At present, nearly half the hydrogen at the core has been consumed, with the remainder of the atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.&lt;ref name=gough81/&gt;

[[File:Solar evolution (English).svg|right|thumb|320px|Evolution of the Sun's [[Solar luminosity|luminosity]], [[Solar radius|radius]] and [[effective temperature]] compared to the present Sun. After Ribas (2010).&lt;ref name=ribas2010/&gt;]]
The result of this process has been a steady increase in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a [[main sequence]] star, it radiated only 70% of the current [[luminosity]]. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt; Likewise, in three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the [[subgiant star|subgiant]] stage and [[stellar evolution|evolve]] into a [[red giant]].&lt;ref name=apj418/&gt;

By this time, the [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision|collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies]] should be underway. Although this could result in the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or its planets.&lt;ref name=Cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cox2008/&gt;

=== Climate impact ===

{{See also|Medea hypothesis}}

The rate of weathering of [[silicate minerals]] will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid [[carbonate]]s. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of carbon dioxide will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive,&lt;ref name=heath_doyle09/&gt; the last living trees being evergreen [[conifer]]s.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; However, [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbon fixation]] can continue at much lower concentrations, down to above 10 parts per million. Thus plants using {{c4}} photosynthesis may be able to survive for at least 0.8 billion years and possibly as long as 1.2 billion years from now, after which rising temperatures will make the biosphere unsustainable.&lt;ref name=nature360/&gt;&lt;ref name=tellus_b_52_1/&gt;&lt;ref name=grl28_9/&gt; Currently, {{c4}} plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and 1% of its known plant species.&lt;ref name=Bond2005/&gt; For example, about 50% of all grass species ([[Poaceae]]) use the {{c4}} photosynthetic [[metabolic pathway|pathway]],{{sfn|van der Maarel|2005|p=363}} as do many species in the herbaceous family [[Amaranthaceae]].&lt;ref name=ijps164_6/&gt;

When the levels of carbon dioxide fall to the limit where photosynthesis is barely sustainable, the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to oscillate up and down. This will allow land vegetation to flourish each time the level of carbon dioxide rises due to [[tectonic]] activity and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] from animal life. However, the long term trend is for the plant life on land to die off altogether as most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere becomes [[Carbon sequestration|sequestered]] in the Earth.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}} Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of carbon dioxide of a few parts per million, so these life forms would probably disappear only because of rising temperatures and the loss of the biosphere.&lt;ref name=nature360/&gt;

Plants—and, by extension, animals—could survive longer by evolving other strategies such as requiring less carbon dioxide for photosynthetic processes, becoming [[Carnivorous plant|carnivorous]], adapting to [[desiccation]], or [[mycoheterotrophy|associating with]] [[fungi]]. These adaptations are likely to appear near the beginning of the moist greenhouse (see [[Future of the Earth#Loss of oceans|further]]).&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt;

The loss of plant life will also result in the eventual loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions. This will result in less [[attenuation]] of [[DNA]]-damaging UV,&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; as well as the death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large [[mammal]]s, followed by small mammals, birds, [[amphibian]]s and large fish, [[reptile]]s and small fish, and finally [[invertebrate]]s. Before this happens, it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would survive better than larger ones because of lesser oxygen requirements, while birds would fare better than mammals thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt;

In their work ''The Life and Death of Planet Earth'', authors [[Peter D. Ward]] and [[Donald Brownlee]] have argued that some form of animal life may continue even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the [[Burgess Shale]] in [[British Columbia, Canada]], to determine the climate of the [[Cambrian explosion|Cambrian Explosion]], and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with [[Marine life|sea life]]. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from [[asphyxia]]tion within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}}

As temperatures continue to rise, the last of animal life will be driven toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the [[polar night]], [[aestivation|aestivating]] during the [[polar day]] due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily be found in the oceans.{{sfn|Ward|Brownlee|2003|pp=117–28}} However, due to a decrease in the amount of organic matter entering the oceans from land as well as a decrease in [[Dissolved Oxygen|dissolved oxygen]],&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; sea life would disappear too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of [[Fresh water|freshwater]] species and conclude with invertebrates,&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt; particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as [[termite]]s or those near [[hydrothermal vents]] such as [[worm]]s of the genus ''[[Riftia]]''.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; As a result of these processes, [[Multicellular organism|multicellular life forms]] may be extinct in about 800 million years, and [[eukaryote]]s in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the [[prokaryote]]s.&lt;ref name=bd2_6_1665/&gt;

=== Loss of oceans{{anchor|Ocean-free_era}} ===
[[File:Venuspioneeruv.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Light brown clouds wrap around a planet, as seen from space.|The [[atmosphere of Venus]] is in a "super-greenhouse" state.]]
One billion years from now, about 27% of the modern ocean will have been subducted into the mantle. If this process were allowed to continue uninterrupted, it would reach an equilibrium state where 65% of the current surface reservoir would remain at the surface.&lt;ref name=hess5_4 /&gt; Once the solar luminosity is 10% higher than its current value, the average global surface temperature will rise to {{convert|320|K|C F}}. The atmosphere will become a "moist greenhouse" leading to a [[Runaway greenhouse effect|runaway]] [[evaporation]] of the oceans.&lt;ref name=mnras386_1/&gt;{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} At this point, models of the Earth's future environment demonstrate that the [[stratosphere]] would contain increasing levels of water. These water molecules will be broken down through [[photodissociation]] by solar UV, allowing hydrogen to [[Atmospheric escape|escape the atmosphere]]. The net result would be a loss of the world's sea water by about 1.1 billion years from the present.&lt;ref name=icarus74/&gt;&lt;ref name=guinan_ribas/&gt; This will be a simple dramatic step in annihilating all life on Earth.

There will be two variations of this future warming feedback: the "moist greenhouse" where water vapor dominates the [[troposphere]] while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere (if the oceans evaporate very quickly), and the "runaway greenhouse" where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (if the oceans evaporate too slowly). The Earth will undergo rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over {{Cvt|900|C|F K}} as the atmosphere will be totally overwhelmed by water vapor, causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life, perhaps in about 3 billion years. In this ocean-free era, there will continue to be surface reservoirs as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle,&lt;ref name=hess5_4/&gt; where it is estimated that there is an amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth's oceans.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=94}} Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rain storms, but for the most part the planet would be a dry desert with large [[dune]]fields covering its equator, and a few [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] on what was once the ocean floor, similar to the ones in the [[Atacama Desert]] in Chile.&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt;

With no water to serve as a lubricant, plate tectonics would very likely stop and the most visible signs of geological activity would be [[shield volcano]]es located above mantle [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]].{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}}&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multicellular life.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} Most of these microbes will be [[halophile]]s and life could find refuge in the atmosphere as [[Life on Venus#Recent speculation|has been proposed to have happened on Venus]].&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt; However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years&lt;ref name=bd2_6_1665/&gt; and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water at high [[latitude]]s and heights or in caverns with trapped ice. However, underground life could last longer.&lt;ref name=mj2012/&gt; What proceeds this depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a "super-greenhouse" state like that of the planet [[Venus]]. But, as stated above, without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried&lt;ref name=lunine09/&gt; until the Sun becomes a red giant and its increased luminosity heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=94}}

The loss of the oceans could be delayed until 2 billion years in the future if the [[atmospheric pressure]] were to decline. A lower atmospheric pressure would reduce the [[greenhouse effect]], thereby lowering the surface temperature. This could occur if [[Nitrogen cycle|natural processes were to remove the nitrogen from the atmosphere]]. Studies of organic sediments has shown that at least {{convert|100| kPa|atm|lk=on}} of nitrogen has been removed from the atmosphere over the past four billion years; enough to effectively double the current atmospheric pressure if it were to be released. This rate of removal would be sufficient to counter the effects of increasing solar luminosity for the next two billion years.&lt;ref name=pnas106_24/&gt;

By 2.8 billion years from now, the surface temperature of the Earth will have reached {{convert|422|K|C F}}, even at the poles. At this point, any remaining life will be extinguished due to the extreme conditions. If the Earth loses its surface water by this point, the planet will stay in the same conditions until the Sun becomes a red giant.{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} If this scenario does not happen, then in about 3–4 billion years the amount of water vapour in the lower atmosphere will rise to 40% and a "moist greenhouse" effect will commence&lt;ref name=pnas106_24/&gt; once the luminosity from the Sun reaches 35–40% more than its present-day value.&lt;ref name=icarus74/&gt; A "runaway greenhouse" effect will ensue, causing the atmosphere to heat up and raising the surface temperature to around {{convert|1600|K|C F}}. This is sufficient to melt the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name=guinan_ribas/&gt;{{sfn|Brownlee|2010|p=95}} However, most of the atmosphere will be retained until the Sun has entered the red giant stage.&lt;ref name=minard09/&gt;

With the extinction of life, 2.8 billion years from now it is also expected that Earth [[biosignature]]s will disappear, to be replaced by signatures caused by non-biological processes.&lt;ref name=mj2013/&gt;

=== Red giant stage ===

[[File:Sun red giant.svg|thumb|240px|right|alt=A large red disk represents the Sun as a red giant. An inset box shows the current Sun as a yellow dot.|The size of the current Sun (now in the [[main sequence]]) compared to its estimated size during its [[red giant]] phase]]
Once the Sun changes from burning hydrogen at its core to burning hydrogen around its shell, the core will start to contract and the outer envelope will expand. The total luminosity will steadily increase over the following billion years until it reaches 2,730 times the Sun's current [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] at the age of 12.167 billion years. Most of Earth's atmosphere will be lost to space and its surface will consist of a [[Lava-ocean planet|lava ocean]] with floating continents of metals and metal oxides as well as [[iceberg]]s of [[Refractory|refractory materials]], with its surface temperature reaching more than {{convert|2400|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name="Kargel2003"/&gt; The Sun will experience more rapid mass loss, with about 33% of its total mass shed with the [[solar wind]]. The loss of mass will mean that the orbits of the planets will expand. The orbital distance of the Earth will increase to at most 150% of its current value.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The most rapid part of the Sun's expansion into a red giant will occur during the final stages, when the Sun will be about 12 billion years old. It is likely to expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus, reaching a maximum radius of {{convert|1.2|AU|km|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The Earth will interact tidally with the Sun's outer atmosphere, which would serve to decrease Earth's orbital radius. Drag from the [[chromosphere]] of the Sun would also reduce the Earth's orbit. These effects will act to counterbalance the effect of mass loss by the Sun, and the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun.&lt;ref name=mnras361/&gt;

The drag from the solar atmosphere may cause the [[orbit of the Moon]] to decay. Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of {{convert|18470|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it will cross the Earth's [[Roche limit]]. This means that tidal interaction with the Earth would break apart the Moon, turning it into a [[ring system]]. Most of the orbiting ring will then begin to decay, and the debris will impact the Earth. Hence, even if the Earth is not swallowed up by the Sun, the planet may be left moonless.&lt;ref name=space070122/&gt; The [[ablation]] and [[vaporization]] caused by its fall on a decaying trajectory towards the Sun may remove Earth's mantle, leaving just its core, which will finally be destroyed after at most 200 years.&lt;ref name="Goldstein1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jianke1998/&gt; Following this event, Earth's sole legacy will be a very slight increase (0.01%) of the solar [[metallicity]].&lt;ref name="RvMP1997"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;§IIC&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Post-red giant stage ===

[[File:NGC7293 (2004).jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Helix nebula]], a planetary nebula similar to what the Sun will produce in 8 billion years.]]

After fusing helium in its core to [[carbon]], the Sun will begin to collapse again, [[stellar evolution|evolving]] into a compact [[white dwarf]] star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a [[planetary nebula]]. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become [[tidelock]]ed, with each showing only one face to the other.&lt;ref name="tide1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 65 billion years, it is estimated that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the [[Earth–Moon system]] being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2017/01/31/earth-and-moon-may-be-on-long-term-collision-course/#38a21ffa3c68|work=Forbes|author=Bruce Dorminey|title=Earth and Moon May Be on Long-Term Collision Course|date=31 January 2017|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years, then on a time scale of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; (10 quintillion) years the remaining planets in the Solar System will be ejected from the system by [[violent relaxation]]. If this does not occur to the Earth, the ultimate fate of the planet will be that it collides with the [[black dwarf]] Sun due to the decay of its orbit via [[gravitational radiation]], in 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name="dyson"&gt;

The '''Global Earthquake Model (GEM)''' is a [[public–private partnership]] initiated in 2006 by the Global Science Forum of the OECD to develop global, [[open-source software|open-source]] risk assessment software and tools. With committed backing from [[academia]], governments and industry, GEM contributes to achieving profound, lasting reductions in [[earthquake]] risk worldwide by following the priorities of the Hyogo Framework for Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unisdr.org/eng/hfa/hfa.htm | title=Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) - UNISDR}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009 to 2013 GEM is constructing its first working global earthquake model and will provide an authoritative standard for calculating and communicating earthquake risk worldwide.

Since March 2009, GEM is a legal entity in the form of a non-profit foundation based in Pavia, Italy. The GEM Secretariat is hosted at the European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering (EUCENTRE). The current secretary general is John Schneider.

== Mission ==

Between 2000 and 2010 over half a million people died due to earthquakes and [[tsunamis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/world_deaths.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011012207/http://www.earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/world_deaths.php |archivedate=2008-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these in the developing world, where risks increase due to rapid population growth and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;see a.o. http://www.geohazards.no/projects/project3_08/project_3_earthq.htm - figure2&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many earthquake-prone regions no [[risk model]]s exist, and even where models do exist, they are inaccessible. Better risk-awareness can reduce the toll that earthquakes take by leading to better construction, improved emergency response, and greater access to insurance.

GEM will provide a basis for comparing earthquake risks across regions and across borders, and thereby take the necessary first step towards increased awareness and actions that reduce earthquake risk. GEM tools will be usable at the community, national and international level for uniform earthquake risk-evaluation and as a defensible basis for risk-mitigation plans. GEM results will be disseminated all over the world. GEM will build technical capacity and carry out awareness-raising activities.

== Scientific framework ==

The GEM scientific framework serves as the underlying basis for constructing the global earthquake model, and is organised in three principal integrated modules: [[seismic hazard]], [[seismic risk]] and socio-economic impact.

* The hazard module calculates harmonised probabilities of earthquake occurrence and resulting shaking at any given location.
* The risk module calculates damage and direct losses resulting from this damage such as fatalities, injuries and cost of repair. Damage due to strong ground shaking is calculated by combining building vulnerability, population vulnerability and exposure. GEM will furthermore develop remote-sensing and crowd-data collection techniques to classify, monitor and regularly update building inventory and thus regional vulnerability.
* The socio-economic impact module of GEM will provide tools and indices to both estimate and communicate the impact from earthquakes on the economy and society, concentrating in particular on indirect losses. For example, the impact on a company's revenue, on budgets, on poverty. The module will allow for calculations of scenarios which that enable cost/benefit analysis of mitigating actions, such as systematic building strengthening, and facilitate insurance and [[alternative risk transfer]].

== Implementation ==

It will take five years to build the first working global earthquake model – including corresponding tools, software and datasets. The work started in 2009 and will be finished at the end of 2013. Construction occurs in various stages that are partly overlapping in time. The pilot project GEM1 (January 2009 – March 2010) generates GEM’s first products and initial model building infrastructure, Global components will establish a common set of definitions, strategies, standards, quality criteria and formats for the compilation of databases that serve as an input to the global earthquake model. They are addressed by international consortia that respond to calls for proposals on [[Seismic hazard|hazard]], [[Seismic risk|risk]] and socio-economic impact. Global components will provide preliminary data on a global scale, but on a local scale, regional and national programmes will provide more detailed and reliable data. One Global component was the Global GMPEs project that proposed a set of [[Engineering Seismology|ground motion prediction equations]] for use when calculating [[seismic hazard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Jonathan P.|last2=Douglas|first2=John|last3=Javanbarg|first3=Mohammad|last4=Bozorgnia|first4=Yousef|last5=Abrahamson|first5=Norman A.|last6=Boore|first6=David M.|last7=Campbell|first7=Kenneth W.|last8=Delavaud|first8=Elise|last9=Erdik|first9=Mustafa|date=2015-02-01|title=Selection of Ground Motion Prediction Equations for the Global Earthquake Model|journal=Earthquake Spectra|language=EN|volume=31|issue=1|pages=19–45|doi=10.1193/013013eqs017m|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/53375/1/Stewart_etal_ES_2015_Selection_of_ground_motion_prediction_equations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The data produced on a regional and national scale will be carefully quality-controlled and integrated into the global models. The actual development of the model will occur using a common, web-based platform for dynamic  sharing of tools and resources, in order to create software and online tools as end-products. The global earthquake model will be tested and evaluated before its official release; the testing procedure will involve the establishment of scientific experiments that are reproducible, transparent, and set up within a controlled environment.

GEM is however more than the creation and release of this first version of the model. GEM strives for continuous improvement of the model and will ensure that results are disseminated, technology is transferred through training and workshops and that awareness raising activities are deployed in order to contribute to risk reduction worldwide.

'''Grayite''', ThPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; • (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), is a [[thorium]] [[phosphate]] mineral of the Rabdophane group first discovered in 1957 by S.H.U. Bowie in Rhodesia. It is of moderate hardness occurring occasionally in [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s of [[hexagonal]] crystals occasionally but more commonly in microgranular/cryptocrystalline masses. Due to its [[thorium]] content, grayite displays some radioactivity although it is only moderate and the mineral displays powder XRD peaks without any metamict-like effects. The color of grayite is most commonly observed as a light to dark reddish brown but has also been observed as lighter yellows with grayish tints. It has a low to moderate hardness with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 3-4 and has a [[specific gravity]] of 3.7-4.3. It has been found in both intrusive igneous and sedimentary environments.&lt;ref&gt;[Bowie, S.H.U. (1957) Summary of progress for 1956, Geologic Survey of Great Britain, pg. 67]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Formations including grayite were originally documented in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1957 and subsequently around the globe. Some of these locales include the states of Wyoming and Colorado as well as Madagascar. Grayite has often been found in pegmatitic environments amongst other thorium minerals, particularly monazite ((Ce,La)PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Recent work has shown widespread occurrences in Wisconsin pegmatitic environments. Other notable finds of pegmatitic grayite occur in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[Nikola Zidarov and Ognyan Petrov, 2011, "Grayite From Sredna Gora Pegmatites -- First Find in Bulgaria", Comptes rendus de l’Acade'mie bulgare des Sciences, Vol 64, No12, pp.1719-1726]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;["Thirty-Sixth Rochester Mineralogical Symposium: Contributed Papers In Specimen Mineralogy—Part 1." Rocks &amp; Minerals 85.2 (2010): 160-164. EBSCO. 1 Dec. 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; Grayite has also been found in sedimentary environments with an observation of high concentrations in cracks raising the possibility of the mineral as a precipitate from fluid mobilized ions. Formation of grayite and other rhabdophane minerals in this context has been documented in literature.&lt;ref&gt;[Alfons Berger, Edwin Gnos, Emilie Janots, Alain Fernandez, Jörg Giese, Formation and composition of rhabdophane, bastnäsite and hydrated thorium minerals during alteration: Implications for geochronology and low-temperature processes, Chemical Geology, Volume 254, Issues 3–4, 15 September 2008, Pages 238-248 in Chemical Geology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;J.R. Dooley, Jr., and John C. Hathaway, 1961, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P0ZSAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Two Occurrences of Thorium-bearing Minerals with Rhabdophane-like Structures], USGS Professional Paper 424-C, pg. 339-341&lt;/ref&gt;

==As member of rhabdophane group==
Grayite is isostructural with members of the Rhabdophane group such as brockite and rhabdrophane. While previous work has identified grayite as a pseudohexagonal orthorhombic member of the rhabdophane group along with ningyoite, more contemporary work seems to maintain a hexagonal crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;[Frances G. Fisher and Robert Meyrowitz, 1961, "Brockite, a New Calcium Thorium Phosphate from the Wet Mountains, Colorado", American Mineralogist, Vol. 47, pg 1336-1335.]&lt;/ref&gt; These hydrated phosphate minerals often include radioactive elements such as thorium, uranium, and cerium. Powder XRD analysis produces peaks matching those of rhabdophane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Relationship with monazite==
In the identification of new hydrated phosphate minerals related to rhabdophane XRD peak information is usually recorded through different sample preparation methods. Besides standard powder XRD, samples are often heated to ~850&amp;nbsp;°C so that the structure changes. The peak information is analyzed again and upon doing this hydrated thorium phosphate minerals will show a monazite-like structure indicating a possible alteration relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''John Aldridge "Jack" Collom''' (November 8, 1931 – July 2, 2017) was an [[Poetry of the United States|American poet]], essayist, and creative writing [[pedagogue]]. Included among the twenty-five books&lt;ref name="eventful.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denver.eventful.com/events/thepoetisin-poetinresidence-jack-collom-/E0-001-047053757-7|title="The Poet Is In" Poet-in-residence Jack Collom|website=Eventful}}&lt;/ref&gt; he published during his lifetime were ''Red Car Goes By: Selected Poems 1955–2000''; ''Poetry Everywhere: Teaching Poetry Writing in School and in the Community''; and ''Second Nature'', which won the 2013 [[Colorado Book Awards|Colorado Book Award]] for Poetry.&lt;ref name="naropa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naropa.edu/faculty/jack-collom.php|title=Jack Collom|website=www.naropa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of education and pedagogy, he was involved in eco-literature, [[ecopoetics]], and creative writing instruction for children.

==Life and work==
Jack Collom was born John Aldridge Collom in [[Chicago]] on November 8, 1931.&lt;ref name="tributes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crist-mort.tributes.com/dignitymemorial/obituary/Jack-Aldridge-Collom-104946242|title=Jack Collom  Obituary  – Boulder, Colorado – Crist Mortuary|website=crist-mort.tributes.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/jack-collom|title=Jack Collom|date=3 July 2017|website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the small town of [[Western Springs, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omniverse.us/featured-essay-jack-collom/|title=Featured Essay: Jack Collom – OmniVerse|website=omniverse.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; spent much of his time [[birdwatching]],&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandpattern.org/archives/poems/?poem=139|title=Jack Collom · Poems · Woodland Pattern|website=www.woodlandpattern.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the years became an inveterate bird-watcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-931157-01|title=''Red Car Goes By: Selected Poems 1955–2000'' (Reviewed)|publisher=''Publisher's Weekly''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collom moved to [[Fraser, Colorado]], in 1947.&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"/&gt; He studied Forestry at [[Colorado State University|Colorado A&amp;M]] College where he earned a B.S. in 1952.&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/jack-collom|title=Jack Collom :: Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he spent four years in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]],&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"/&gt; and he started writing poetry in 1955 while stationed in [[Tripoli]], Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1990/0924/lpoet.html|title=New Twist for Nature Poetry|first=M. S.|last=Mason|date=24 September 1990|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unit was next stationed at [[Neubiberg]], a base just south of [[Munich]], in [[Bavaria]]. It is there he met his first wife (a native German), in 1956. After his discharge from the military, he moved back to the US after a brief time living in Germany, and worked in factories for twenty years while writing poetry.&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

He received his B.A. in English (1972) and M.A. in English literature (1974) from the [[University of Colorado]],&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"/&gt; where he had studied on the [[G.I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt; In 1974, he began teaching in the "Poetry-in-the-Schools" programs in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; In 1980, he began teaching poetry in the public schools of New York City,&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; by way of the  "Poets In Public Service" and "Teachers &amp; Writers" programs.&lt;ref name="jacketmagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/36/r-collom-hejinian-rb-grenier.shtml|title=Jacket 36 – Late 2008 – Jack Collom and Lyn Hejinian: «Situations, Sings» (collaborative poems), reviewed by Robert Grenier|website=jacketmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collom continued to teach creative writing to children for the next 35 years, in both elementary and secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecafereview.com/fall-2014-poets-jack-collom/|title=Jack Collom – The Cafe Review|date=12 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed a pedagogy for this type of educational approach.&lt;ref name="eventful.com"/&gt;

{{quote|I think of my general approach as organic, inductive, building from the children's familiars up, rather than teaching them intricate forms to master, or attempting to initiate them into a sophisticated sensibility. Time enough for that, and to avoid its pitfalls, when and if they have written personally for some while, and of course writing personally in some strong sense is what the most developed poetry still is. Heavy programming from me at this point would draw out less of their particular gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/onteaching/how-i-teach-poetry-schools|title=How I Teach Poetry in the Schools|first=Jack|last=Collom|date=April 23, 2014|website=poets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Subsequently, [[Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative]] published three books of Collom's essays and commentary on this experience (which included the young students' poems), notably ''Poetry Everywhere'' and ''Moving Windows''.&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

From 1966 to 1977, he published the work of many writers in a [[Literary magazine|little magazine]] called "The".&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; He was twice awarded Poetry Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]],&lt;ref name="jacketmagazine.com"/&gt; and received a [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists award (2012).&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org" /&gt; From 1986 until his death in 2017, Collom taught at [[Naropa University]]'s [[Jack Kerouac School]] of Disembodied Poetics as an [[Professor|adjunct professor]],&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="naropa" /&gt; where he shaped Writing Outreach, a community creative-writing project, into a course.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackkerouacschool.org/2013/02/13/folio-jks-faculty-reading-to-celebrate-recent-publications/|title=FOLIO: JKS Faculty Reading to Celebrate Recent Publications|first=|last=administrator|date=February 13, 2013|publisher=Jack Kerouac School /Folio: Events Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naropa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.naropa.edu/2011-fall/features/from-nature-to-nurture.php|title=From Nature to Nurture|website=magazine.naropa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he pioneered Eco-Lit,&lt;ref name="corpse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpse.org/archives/issue_9/critiques/collom.htm|title=Exquisite Corpse – A Journal of Letters and Life|website=www.corpse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first ecology literature courses ever offered in the United States.&lt;ref name="dailycamera.com" /&gt; Some of his accomplishments as an environmentalist-poet are documented in ''American Environmental Leaders: From Colonial Times to the Present''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/book/ghael|title=American environmental leaders from colonial times to the present|first1=Anne|last1=Becher|first2=Joseph|last2=Richey|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Grey House Pub.|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nature writings and essays about the environment were published in various venues, including ''ecopoetics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecopoetics.wordpress.com|title=ecopoetics|website=ecopoetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Alphabet of Trees: A Guide to Writing Nature Poetry'',&lt;ref name="corpse.org"/&gt; and ''ISLE'', the journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/isle/article-abstract/7/2/243/731906/In-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ (2000) Volume 7 (Issue 2): 243]. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/isle/7.2.243
Published: 01 July 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

He read and taught throughout the United States, in Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], Austria, Belgium, and Germany. In 2008, he was the plenary speaker at the "Poetic Ecologies" conference at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]].&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"/&gt; In 2009, he led a three-week Creativity and Aging Program at Woodland Pattern in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

He worked with numerous dancers, visual artists and musician/composers, and recorded three CDs: ''Calluses of Poetry''&lt;ref&gt;''Calluses of Poetry'', audiobook/CD produced by Treehouse Press, 1996 {{ISBN|9780965187800}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Colors Born of Shadow'',&lt;ref&gt;''Colors Born of Shadow'', audiobook/CD produced by Treehouse Press, 1999 ASIN B000F7G0IY&lt;/ref&gt; with Ken Bernstein,&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; and ''Blue Yodel Blue Heron'', with Dan Hankin and Sierra Collom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blue Yodel Blue Heron|publisher=Baksun Books|year=2002|isbn=9781887997539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, his adopted hometown of Boulder, Colorado, declared and celebrated a "Jack Collom Day".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

I was motivated by the cause of ecology—saving nature and ourselves from our own foolish extinction through pollution and overuse of resources—and the fact that it's an art with admirable philosophical achievements. But also for the fun of it. Humor is an important part of the class, and we can go from discussing the most tragic thing to cracking jokes. I'm for that kind of juxtaposition, which sometimes goes against expectations because people want to look upon nature very solemnly due to its beauty or endangered status.

[[File:18. Лајденфростов ефект.webm|thumb|Demonstration of the Leidenfrost effect]]

The '''Leidenfrost effect''' is a physical [[phenomenon]] in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's [[boiling point]], produces an insulating [[vapor]] layer keeping that liquid from [[boiling]] rapidly.  Because of this 'repulsive force', a droplet hovers over the surface rather than making physical contact with it.  This is most commonly seen when [[cooking]]: one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's [[temperature]] is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan with a temperature below the Leidenfrost point but still above boiling. It is named after [[Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost]], who discussed it in ''A Tract About Some Qualities of Common Water'' in 1751.

The effect is responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It also allows a person to dip a wet finger in molten [[lead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willey|first1=David|title=The Physics Behind Four Amazing Demonstrations|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1999|volume=23|issue=6|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/physics_behind_four_amazing_demonstrations/|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013213439/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/physics_behind_four_amazing_demonstrations/|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or blow out a mouthful of [[liquid nitrogen]], without injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Jearl|title=Boiling and the Leidenfrost Effect|journal=Fundamentals of Physics|pages=1–4|url=http://www.wiley.com/college/phy/halliday320005/pdf/leidenfrost_essay.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904122959/http://www.wiley.com/college/phy/halliday320005/pdf/leidenfrost_essay.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Gulps Into Medical Literature |url=http://www.wpi.edu/news/19989/nitro.html |publisher=[[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] |accessdate=11 October 2014 |date=20 January 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222192214/http://www.wpi.edu/news/19989/nitro.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
[[File:Effet leidenfrost.ogg|thumb|A video clip demonstrating the Leidenfrost effect]]
[[File:Spherical harmonic in water drop.ogv|thumb|Excitation of [[normal modes]] in a drop of water during the Leidenfrost effect]]

The effect can be seen as drops of water are sprinkled onto a pan at various times as it heats up. Initially, as the temperature of the pan is just below {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water flattens out and slowly evaporates, or if the temperature of the pan is well below {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water stays liquid. As the temperature of the pan goes above {{convert|100|C|F}}, the water droplets hiss when touching the pan and these droplets evaporate quickly. Later, as the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect comes into play. On contact with the pan, the water droplets bunch up into small balls of water and skitter around, lasting much longer than when the temperature of the pan was lower. This effect works until a much higher temperature causes any further drops of water to evaporate too quickly to cause this effect.

This is because at temperatures above the Leidenfrost point, the bottom part of the water droplet vaporizes immediately on contact with the hot pan. The resulting gas suspends the rest of the water droplet just above it, preventing any further direct contact between the liquid water and the hot pan.  As steam has much poorer [[thermal conductivity]] than the metal pan, further heat transfer between the pan and the droplet is slowed down dramatically. This also results in the drop being able to skid around the pan on the layer of gas just under it.

[[File:Heat transfer leading to Leidenfrost effect for water at 1 atm.png|thumb|Behavior of water on a hot plate. Graph shows heat transfer (flux) vs temperature. Leidenfrost effect occurs after transition boiling.]]

The temperature at which the Leidenfrost effect begins to occur is not easy to predict. Even if the volume of the drop of liquid stays the same, the Leidenfrost point may be quite different, with a complicated dependence on the properties of the surface, as well as any impurities in the liquid. Some research has been conducted into a theoretical model of the system, but it is quite complicated.&lt;ref name="Bernardin &amp; Mudawar" &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1470487 |title=A Cavity Activation and Bubble Growth Model of the Leidenfrost Point |journal=Journal of Heat Transfer |volume=124 |issue=5 |pages=864–74 |date=2002 |last1=Bernardin |first1=John D. |last2=Mudawar |first2=Issam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a very rough estimate, the Leidenfrost point for a drop of water on a frying pan might occur at {{convert|193|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The effect was also described by the eminent Victorian steam boiler designer, [[Sir William Fairbairn]], in reference to its effect on massively reducing heat transfer from a hot iron surface to water, such as within a boiler. In a pair of lectures on boiler design,&lt;ref name="Fairbairn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Two Lectures: The Construction of Boilers, and on Boiler Explosions, with the means of prevention |author=[[William Fairbairn]] |date=1851 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VD5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fairbairn%20boiler&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123164123/https://books.google.com/books?id=VD5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=fairbairn%20boiler&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-11-23 |df= }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he cited the work of Pierre Hippolyte Boutigny (1798-1884) and Professor Bowman of [[King's College, London]] in studying this. A drop of water that was vaporized almost immediately at {{convert|168|C}} persisted for 152 seconds at {{convert|202|C}}. Lower temperatures in a boiler [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] might evaporate water more quickly as a result; compare [[Mpemba effect]]. An alternative approach was to increase the temperature beyond the Leidenfrost point. Fairbairn considered this too, and may have been contemplating the [[flash boiler|flash steam boiler]], but considered the technical aspects insurmountable for the time.

The Leidenfrost point may also be taken to be the temperature for which the hovering droplet lasts longest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Incropera, DeWitt, Bergman &amp; Lavine: Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, 6th edition. Pages 325-330&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been demonstrated that it is possible to stabilize the Leidenfrost vapour layer of water by exploiting [[superhydrophobic]] surfaces. In this case, once the vapour layer is established, cooling never collapses the layer, and no nucleate boiling occurs; the layer instead slowly relaxes until the surface is cooled.&lt;ref name="vakarelski2012"&gt;{{cite journal  |doi=10.1038/nature11418 |pmid=22972299 |title=Stabilization of Leidenfrost vapour layer by textured superhydrophobic surfaces |journal=Nature |volume=489 |issue=7415 |pages=274–7 |date=2012 |last1=Vakarelski |first1=Ivan U. |last2=Patankar |first2=Neelesh A. |last3=Marston |first3=Jeremy O. |last4=Chan |first4=Derek Y. C. |last5=Thoroddsen |first5=Sigurdur T. |bibcode=2012Natur.489..274V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leidenfrost effect has been used for the development of high sensitivity ambient mass spectrometry. Under the influence of Leidenfrost condition the Levitating droplet does not release molecules out and the molecules are enriched inside the droplet. At the last moment of droplet evaporation all of the enriched molecules release in a short time domain and thus increase the sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Leidenfrost Phenomenon-assisted Thermal Desorption (LPTD) and Its Application to Open Ion Sources at Atmospheric Pressure Mass Spectrometry| journal=Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry |authors=Subhrakanti Saha, Lee Chuin Chen, Mridul Kanti Mandal, Kenzo Hiraoka | date=March 2013 | volume=24 | issue=3 | pages=341–7 | doi=10.1007/s13361-012-0564-y|bibcode = 2013JASMS..24..341S | pmid=23423791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[heat engine]] based on the Leidenfrost effect has been prototyped.  It has the advantage of extremely low friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Gary G.|last2=Ledesma-Aguilar|first2=Rodrigio|last3=McHale|first3=Glen|last4=Sefiane|first4=Khellil|title=A sublimation heat engine|journal=Nature Communications|date=3 March 2015|doi=10.1038/ncomms7390|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150303/ncomms7390/full/ncomms7390.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6390W|volume=6|pages=6390|pmid=25731669|pmc=4366496|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307073730/http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150303/ncomms7390/full/ncomms7390.html|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leidenfrost point ==
[[File:Water droplet Leidenfrost effect cropped.JPG|thumb|A water droplet experiencing Leidenfrost effect on a hot stove plate]]

The Leidenfrost point signifies the onset of stable film boiling. It represents the point on the boiling curve where the heat flux is at the minimum and the surface is completely covered by a vapor blanket. Heat transfer from the surface to the liquid occurs by conduction and radiation through the vapor. In 1756, Leidenfrost observed that water droplets supported by the vapor film slowly evaporate as they move about on the hot surface. As the surface temperature is increased, radiation through the vapor film becomes more significant and the heat flux increases with increasing excess temperature.

The minimum heat flux for a large horizontal plate can be derived from Zuber's equation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{{\frac{q}{A}}_{min}}=C{{h}_{fg}}{{\rho }_{v}}{{\left[ \frac{\sigma g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}{{{\left( {{\rho }_{L}}+{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}^{2}}} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{4}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the properties are evaluated at saturation temperature. Zuber's constant, C is approximately 0.09 for most fluids at moderate pressures.

== Heat transfer correlations ==

The heat transfer coefficient may be approximated using Bromley's equation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=C{{\left[ \frac{k_{v}^{3}{{\rho }_{v}}g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)\left( {{h}_{fg}}+0.4{{c}_{pv}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right) \right)}{{{D}_{o}}{{\mu }_{v}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{4}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;{{D}_{o}}&lt;/math&gt; is the outside diameter of the tube. The correlation constant C is 0.62 for horizontal cylinders and vertical plates and 0.67 for spheres. Vapor properties are evaluated at film temperature.

For stable film boiling on a horizontal surface, Berenson has modified Bromley's equation to yield,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;James R. Welty; Charles E. Wicks; Robert E. Wilson; Gregory L. Rorrer., "Fundamentals of Momentum, Heat and Mass transfer" 5th edition, John Wiley and Sons. Page 327&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=0.425{{\left[ \frac{k_{vf}^{3}{{\rho }_{vf}}g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)\left( {{h}_{fg}}+0.4{{c}_{pv}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right) \right)}{{{\mu }_{vf}}\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)\sqrt{\sigma /g\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)}} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{4}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

For vertical tubes, Hsu and Westwater have correlated the following equation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h{{\left[ \frac{\mu _{v}^{2}}{g{{\rho }_{v}}\left( {{\rho }_{L}}-{{\rho }_{v}} \right)k_{v}^{3}} \right]}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}}=0.0020{{\left[ \frac{4m}{\pi {{D}_{v}}{{\mu }_{v}}} \right]}^{0.6}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, m is the mass flow rate in &lt;math&gt;l{{b}_{m}}/hr&lt;/math&gt; at the upper end of the tube

At excess temperatures above that at the minimum heat flux, the contribution of radiation becomes appreciable and becomes dominant at high excess temperatures. The total heat transfer coefficient can be is thus a combination of the two. Bromley has suggested the following equations for film boiling boiling from the outer surface of horizontal tubes.

&lt;math&gt;{{h}^{{}^{4}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}}={{h}_{conv}}^{{}^{4}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}+{{h}_{rad}}{{h}^{{}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{3}\;}}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;{{h}_{rad}}&lt;{{h}_{conv}}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;h={{h}_{conv}}+\frac{3}{4}{{h}_{rad}}&lt;/math&gt;

The effective radiation coefficient, &lt;math&gt;{{h}_{rad}}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as,

&lt;math&gt;{{h}_{rad}}=\frac{\varepsilon \sigma \left( T_{s}^{4}-T_{sat}^{4} \right)}{\left( {{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{sat}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the emissivity of the solid and &lt;math&gt;\sigma &lt;/math&gt; is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

== Pressure field in a Leidenfrost droplet ==

The equation for the pressure field in the vapor region between the droplet and the solid surface can be solved for using the standard momentum and [[continuity equations]].  For the sake of simplicity in solving, a linear temperature profile and a parabolic velocity profile are assumed within the [[vapor phase]]. The heat transfer within the vapor phase is assumed to be through [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]]. With these approximations, the Navier-Stokes equation can be solved&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Van P. , Liquid Vapor Phase change Phenomena&lt;/ref&gt; to get the pressure field.

== Leidenfrost temperature and surface tension effects ==

The Leidenfrost temperature is the property of a given set of solid-liquid pair. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed as Leidenfrost temperature. The calculation of Leidenfrost temperature involves the calculation of minimum film boiling temperature of a fluid. Berenson&lt;ref&gt;Berenson, P.J., ''[http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 Film boiling heat transfer from a horizontal surface] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125436/http://heattransfer.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1432357 |date=2015-04-02 }}'', Journal of Heat Transfer, Volume 83, 1961, Pages 351-362&lt;/ref&gt; obtained a relation for the minimum film boiling temperature from minimum heat flux arguments. While the equation for the minimum film boiling temperature, which can be found in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective.  One critical parameter to consider is the [[surface tension]]. The proportional relationship between the minimum film boiling temperature and surface tension is to be expected since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of [[nucleate boiling]]. Since film boiling occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for film boiling should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.

Henry developed a model for Leidenfrost phenomenon which includes transient wetting and microlayer evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, R.E., ''[A correlation for the minimum film boiling temperature]'',Chem. Eng. Prog. Symp. Ser. , Volume 70, 1974, Pages 81-90&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Leidenfrost phenomenon is a special case of film boiling, the Leidenfrost temperature is related to the minimum film boiling temperature via a relation which factors in the properties of the solid being used. While the Leidenfrost temperature is not directly related to the surface tension of the fluid, it is indirectly dependent on it through the film boiling temperature. For fluids with similar thermophysical properties, the one with higher surface tension usually has a higher Leidenfrost temperature.

For example, for a saturated water-copper interface, the Leidenfrost temperature is {{convert|257|C}}. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and [[viscosity]] differences are also contributing factors.)

== Reactive Leidenfrost effect ==
[[File:Reactive Leidenfrost Effect with Cellulose.jpg|thumb|Reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on silica, {{convert|750|C}}]]

Non-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a 'reactive Leidenfrost effect,' whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientists levitate wood on structured surfaces captured by high speed photography" Phys.org. {{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611164453/http://phys.org/news/2015-06-scientists-levitate-wood-surfaces-captured.html |archivedate=2015-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Detailed characterization of the reactive Leidenfrost effect was completed for small particles of [[cellulose]] (~0.5&amp;nbsp;mm) on high temperature polished surfaces by high speed photography.  Cellulose was shown to decompose to short-chain [[oligomers]] which melt and wet smooth surfaces with increasing heat transfer associated with increasing surface temperature. Above {{convert|675|C}}, cellulose was observed to exhibit transition boiling with violent bubbling and associated reduction in heat transfer.  Liftoff of the cellulose droplet (depicted at the right) was observed to occur above about {{convert|750|C}} associated with a dramatic reduction in heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Teixeira| first1 =  Andrew R| last2 =  Krumm| first2 =  Christoph| last3 =  Vinter| first3 =  Katherine P| last4 =  Paulsen| first4 =  Alex D| last5 =  Zhu| first5 =  Cheng| last6 =  Maduskar| first6 =  Saurabh| last7 =  Joseph| first7 =  Kristeen E| last8 =  Greco| first8 =  Katharine| last9 =  Stelatto| first9 =  Michael| last10 =  Davis| first10 =  Eric| last11 =  Vincent| first11 =  Brendon| last12 =  Hermann| first12 =  Richard| last13 =  Suszynski| first13 =  Wieslaw| last14 =  Schmidt| first14 =  Lanny D| last15 =  Fan| first15 =  Wei| last16 =  Rothstein| first16 =  Jonathan P| last17 =  Dauenhauer| first17 =  Paul J| year = 2015 | title = Reactive Liftoff of Crystalline Cellulose Particles | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11238 | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | page = 11238 | doi = 10.1038/srep11238 | pmid =  26057818| pmc =  4460903| bibcode = 2015NatSR...511238T | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117162337/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11238 | archivedate = 2015-11-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High speed photography of the reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on porous surfaces (macroporous [[alumina]]) was also shown to suppress the reactive Leidenfrost effect and enhance overall heat transfer rates to the particle from the surface.  The new phenomenon of a 'reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect' was characterized by a dimensionless quantity (φ&lt;sub&gt;RL&lt;/sub&gt;= τ&lt;sub&gt;conv&lt;/sub&gt;/τ&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt;), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt; φ&lt;sub&gt;RL&lt;/sub&gt;&lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The reactive Leidenfrost effect with cellulose will occur in numerous high temperature applications with carbohydrate polymers including biomass conversion to [[biofuels]], preparation and [[cooking]] of food, and [[tobacco]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientists Levitate Wood on Structured Surfaces Captured by High Speed Photography |date=June 9, 2015 |url=http://www.newswire.com/press-release/scientists-levitate-wood-on-structured-surfaces-captured-by |website=www.newswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[Benoît de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphins— the mammals with the high IQ— are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

The effect has also been used to explain the spatial version of the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which an otherwise unstable object may be stabilised by rapidly repeated observations.&lt;ref name="zeno"/&gt;

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in [[Vienna]] demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as [[fullerene]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}}, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a particle:&lt;ref name="Resnick 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first=R. |last=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \lambda = h/p\\

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928).

(2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955).

Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009). ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}, pp. 30–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">In [[chemistry]], '''metal vapor synthesis''' (MVS) is a method for preparing [[metal complex]]es by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with [[ligand]]s.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-toluene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdampfer-test.de/aspire-cleito/|title=Aspire Cleito Verdampfer Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-08-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal evaporates upon being [[resistive heating|heated resistively]] or irradiated with an [[electron beam]].  The apparatus operates under high vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D. Heroux "Metal Vapor Synthesis of Transition Metal Compounds" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry 2006, John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0470862106.ia137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Educ., 1972, volume 49, p 782. {{DOI| 10.1021/ed049p782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of [[molybdenum(V) chloride]] in the presence of the diene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stephan, G.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

{{Biodiversity}}
A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

A '''near-Earth supernova''' is an explosion resulting from the  death of a [[star]] that occurs close enough to the [[Earth]] (roughly less than 10 to 300 parsecs (30 to 1000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s) away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What If History’s Brightest Supernova Exploded In Earth’s Backyard? |author=Joshua Sokol |date=Jan 14, 2016 |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/rare-supernova-crab-nebula/424125/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to have noticeable effects on Earth's [[biosphere]].

==Effects on Earth==
On average, a [[supernova]] explosion occurs within {{convert|10|pc|ly|abbr=off}} of the Earth every 240 million years.{{efn|Since a radius of 100 light years contains approximately 27.8 times as much volume as one of 33 light years, a supernova should occur within a radius of 100 light years from Earth approximately once every 8.6 million years.  A supernova would occur within a radius of 200 light years approximately once every million years, within 500 light years every 69,000 years, and within 1,000 light years roughly every 8,625 years.{{Original research inline|date=May 2016}}}} [[Gamma ray]]s are responsible for most of the adverse effects a supernova can have on a living [[terrestrial planet]]. In Earth's case, gamma rays induce a [[chemical reaction]] in the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], converting molecular [[nitrogen]] into [[nitrogen oxide]]s, depleting the [[ozone layer]] enough to expose the surface to harmful [[solar radiation|solar]] and [[cosmic radiation]] (mainly ultra-violet). [[Phytoplankton]] and [[Coral Reef|reef]] communities would be particularly affected, which could severely deplete the base of the marine food chain.&lt;ref name="ellis93"&gt;

==Risk by supernova type==
Speculation as to the effects of a nearby supernova on Earth often focuses on large stars as [[Type II supernova]] candidates. Several prominent stars within a few hundred light years of the Sun are candidates for becoming supernovae in as little as a millennium. Although they would be spectacular to look at, were these "predictable" supernovae to occur, they are thought to have little potential to affect Earth.

It is estimated that a Type&amp;nbsp;II supernova closer than eight [[parsec]]s (26&amp;nbsp;light-years) would destroy more than half of the Earth's ozone layer.&lt;ref name=Gehrels&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such estimates are based on atmospheric modeling and the measured radiation flux from [[SN 1987A]], a Type&amp;nbsp;II supernova in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Estimates of the rate of supernova occurrence within 10&amp;nbsp;parsecs of the Earth vary from 0.05–0.5 per [[Gigayear|Ga]]&lt;ref name=Whitten1976/&gt; to 10 per Ga.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies assume that supernovae are concentrated in the spiral arms of the galaxy, and that supernova explosions near the Sun usually occur during the ~10 million years that the Sun takes to pass through one of these regions.&lt;ref name=Gehrels/&gt; Examples of relatively near supernovae are the [[Vela Supernova Remnant]] (~800 ly, ~12,000 years ago) and [[Geminga]] (~550 ly, ~300,000 years ago).

[[Type Ia supernova]]e are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because Type&amp;nbsp;Ia supernovae arise from dim, common [[white dwarf]] stars, it is likely that a supernova that could affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and take place in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is [[IK Pegasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Past events==
Evidence from daughter products of short-lived [[radioactive isotope]]s shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the [[Solar System]] 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|Supernova production of heavy elements]] over astronomic periods of time ultimately made the [[biochemistry|chemistry of life]] on Earth possible.

Past supernovae might be detectable on Earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in [[rock strata]]. Subsequently, [[Iron#Isotopes|iron-60]] enrichment has been reported in deep-sea rock of the [[Pacific Ocean]] by researchers from the [[Technical University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three atoms of this iron isotope were found in the top 2&amp;nbsp;cm of crust (this layer corresponds to times from 13.4 to 0 million years ago).&lt;ref name="Fields"/&gt; It is estimated that the supernova must have occurred in the last 5 million years or else it would have had to happen very close to the solar system to account for so much iron-60 still being here. A supernova occurring so close would have probably caused a mass extinction, which did not happen in that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Fields &amp; Ellis, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity of iron seems to indicate that the supernova was less than 30 parsecs away. On the other hand, the authors estimate the frequency of supernovae at a distance less than ''D'' (for reasonably small ''D'') as around (''D''/10 [[parsec|pc]])&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per [[annum|Ga]], which gives a probability of only around 5% for a supernova within 30 pc in the last 5 million years. They point out that the probability may be higher because the Solar System is entering the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way.

[[Gamma ray burst]]s from "dangerously close" supernova explosions occur two or more times per billion years, and this has been proposed as the cause of the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|end Ordovician extinction]], which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1998 a [[supernova remnant]], [[RX J0852.0-4622]], was found in front (apparently) of the larger [[Vela Supernova Remnant]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that it must have exploded fairly recently (perhaps around 1200 [[Common Era|CE]]), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 660 ly). If so, this is an unexpected  event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Fields" /&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to evolution:
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg|thumb|400px|right|A diagram showing the relationships betweens various groups of organisms]]
'''[[Evolution]]''' – change in [[heritable trait]]s of [[Organisms|biological organisms]] over generations due to [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]], and [[genetic drift]].  Also known as '''descent with modification'''. Over time these evolutionary processes lead to formation of new species ([[speciation]]), changes within lineages ([[anagenesis]]), and loss of species ([[extinction]]). "Evolution" is also another name for [[evolutionary biology]], the subfield of [[biology]] concerned with studying [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[diversity of life]] on Earth.

The '''Peterson Identification System''' is a practical method for the field identification of [[Animal identification|animals]], plants and other natural phenomena. It was devised by [[ornithologist]] [[Roger Tory Peterson]] in 1934 for the first of his series of ''Field Guide''s&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Roger Tory (1934), ''A Field Guide to the Birds'', [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Peterson Field Guides]].) Peterson devised his system "so that live birds could be identified readily at a distance by their 'field marks' without resorting to the bird-in-hand characters that the early collectors relied on. During the last half century the binocular and the spotting scope have replaced the shotgun."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Roger Tory (1980), ''A Field Guide to the Birds: A Completely New Guide to All the Birds of Eastern and Central North America'', Fourth Edition, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging early [[environmental movement]].

==The system==
Created for use by [[amateur]] naturalists and [[laymen]], rather than specialists, the "Peterson System" is essentially a pictorial key based upon readily noticed visual impressions rather than on the technical features of interest to scientists. The technique involves patternistic drawings with arrows that pinpoint the key field comparisons between similar species.

==Influence==
Since the first Peterson ''Field Guide'', the system has been expanded to about three dozen volumes in the series as well as being emulated by many other publishers and authors of [[field guide]]s. It has become the near-universally accepted standard, first in the United States and Europe and then around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">In [[physics]], the term '''Pouillet effect''' refers to an [[exothermic reaction]] that takes place when a liquid is added to a powder. It was first observed by [[John Leslie (physicist)|Leslie]] in 1802 when dry sawdust was wetted with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leslie|first1=John|title=On capillary action|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1802|volume=14|pages=193–205|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000068484644;view=1up;seq=205|series=1st series}}  From p. 201:  Upon wetting paper or linen with water or oil, and " … applying a delicate thermometer, I perceived a very sensible extrication of heat invariably to take place during such combinations. And this effect was the greater in proportion to the previous dryness of the solid.  Thus I have sometimes produced a heat of ten degrees by moistening saw-dust which had been parched before the fire."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Pouillet]] later described this phenomenon in 1822 when it came to be known as the '''Pouillet effect''' in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pouillet|title=Mémoire sur de nouveaux phénomènes de production de chaleur|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1822|volume=20|pages=141–162|series=2nd series|trans-title=Memoir on new phenomena of heat production|language=French}}  From p. 142:  ''"À l'instant où un liquide mouille un solide, il y a dégagement de chaleur."''

The '''Regius Professor of Natural History''' is a [[Regius Professor]]ship at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland. It was originally called the Regius Professor of Civil and Natural History at [[Marischal College]] until in 1860 [[Marischal College]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]]s merged to form the University of Aberdeen, and the title changed to Natural History.

Unlike most other suction cups, it does not exert any [[suction]] force when it is not in contact with an object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=May 2010|title=Design, fabrication, and implementation of self-sealing suction cup arrays for grasping|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5509818/|journal=2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation|volume=|pages=|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its grasping ability is achieved entirely through passive means without the use of sensors, valves, or actuators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=November 2011|title=A Self-Sealing Suction Cup Array for Grasping|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265068249_A_Self-Sealing_Suction_Cup_Array_for_Grasping|journal=Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics|volume=3|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1115/1.4004893|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was designed so that, when used as part of a suction cup array, the suction cups that don’t come in contact with the object remain sealed. By having only the suction cups that are in direct contact of the object to exhibit suction force, the researchers were able to minimize leak points where air could enter and increase the pressure that each active cup receives, maximizing the suction force.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/3-d-printed-octopus-suckers-help-robots-stick/|title=3-D Printed Octopus Suckers Help Robots Stick|last=Harmon|first=Katherine|date=February 21, 2013|work=Scientific American|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an array of self-sealing suction cups can grasp and pick up a wide range of object sizes and shapes. This comes in contrast to conventional suction cups that are typically designed for one specific object size and geometry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, suction cups of various sizes have been manufactured, ranging from the palm of a hand to the point of a fingertip.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/army-uses-3d-printed-tentacles-help-robots-manipulate-objects/139141260531080|title=Army Uses 3D-Printed Tentacles to Help Robots Manipulate Objects|last=Montalbano|first=Elizabeth|date=March 25, 2013|work=Design News|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-sealing suction cup was first developed in 2010 by a collaboration of researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]], the [[Edgewood Chemical Biological Center]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and the University of Maryland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Design ==
The design of the self-sealing suction cup was initially inspired by the [[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] of the octopus and its ability to pick up different sized items by individually actuating its suction cups based on the item’s size and physical features.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=1657|title=ECBC, ARL collaborate on octopus-inspired suction cup|last=|first=|date=February 12, 2013|work=Army Research Laboratory|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal geometry of the self-sealing suction cup was designed to the smallest possible size and features a minimum wall thickness of 1.02&amp;nbsp;mm, a tube diameter of 1.59&amp;nbsp;mm, and minimum part spacing of 0.13&amp;nbsp;mm. The suction cup incorporates a mix of rubber and plastic components, where the cup lip, base, tube, springs, and plug are made out of soft rubber while the cup side, collar, hinges, and flange are made out of plastic. As part of its design, a central [[vacuum pump]] can be used to maximize the suction force of the suction cup.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A multi-material [[3d printer|3D printer]] was used to create the prototype of the self-sealing suction cup in about 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Inside the self-sealing suction cup, the plug is positioned close to the tube opening so that it can get sucked into the tube seal the hole when the central suction line is powered. A pair of springs connected to the suction cup’s base helps maintain the plug’s position, restoring the plug seal in the absence of object forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the cup makes contact with an object, a hinge action raises the plug away from the suction tube. The moment the cup’s lips are pushed against the object, the passive reaction forces from the cup lips are transferred to the rubber base of the cup, which stretches over the collar and allow the structure to compress. Acting as a pivot for the hinges, the collar causes the hinges to rotate and the edges of the hinges slide along the underside of the flange and raise the plug away from the suction tube opening. As a result, the suction cup self-seals when not in contact with an object and self-opens the cup’s lips makes contacts with an object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, several improvements were made to the design of the self-sealing suction cup to improve its grasping capabilities. The previous design demonstrated the following flaws:&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|last2=Desai|first2=Jaydev|date=November 21, 2015|title=Compact Hand with Passive Grasping|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm3_CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=self-sealing+suction+cup+array+for+grasping+%22army+research%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UNQMkZUWVM&amp;sig=Of1S1QQhxBt2N2Hwa5qkGcQDq_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhqo2yv7rcAhXMUt8KHcSeAnQQ6AEITDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=self-sealing%20suction%20cup%20array%20for%20grasping%20%22army%20research%22&amp;f=false|journal=Experimental Robotics: The 14th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics|volume=|pages=117–126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The design required a high overall cup height, which increased the bulk of the device.
# The design was relatively fragile with respect to [[Hyperextension|hyper-extension]] as well as [[torsional]] and [[shear force]]s.
# The internal geometry made it difficult to remove the support material inside, varying the quality of the seal.

To address these flaws, researchers from ARL decreased the number of components by consolidating the functions of several parts, which reduced the uncompressed height of the suction cup by almost 50% to 0.72&amp;nbsp;cm. The cup diameter was also reduced to 1.07&amp;nbsp;cm. A [[lever]] system was added to the base of the cup, which pivots the collar to lift the plug. In addition, the tube doubles as a spring, which helps restore the levers and the plug to their closed position. A plastic restraint was added around the cup to aid with handling the hyper-extension, shear, and torsional forces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Performance ==
The self-sealing suction cup has been subjected to a series of tests to determine the quality of its performance. A flexible test rig with four dime-sized suction cups and plastic ribs connected with rubber tubes was created for force-displacement and testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A force-displacement test that compared the performance between the self-sealing suction cup, an identical suction cup, and a commercially available suction cup found that the internal structures of the self-sealing cup allowed more force to be exerted for the same displacement compared to the other cups. However, under identical conditions, the self-sealing cup achieved a maximum force of 12.5 N while the commercially available cup achieved a maximum force of 12.9 N.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A seal quality test measured the pressure generated from each self-sealing suction cup. The results showed that an array of four cups maintained a pressure of 93.8% atmospheric. The test also demonstrated that not all the cups were equally efficient at sealing after object contact. However, this could be the result of variation in the cups’ prior usage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

During object grasping testing where the grasping range was examined, the test rig successfully grasped about 80% of the objects attempted. These items consisted of the following: TV remote, pill bottle, glue stick, eyeglasses, fork, disposable bottle, toothpaste, coffee mug, bowl, plate, book, cell phone, bar of soap, paper money, mail, keys, show, table knife, medicine box, credit card, coin, pillow, hairbrush, non-disposable bottle, wallet, magazine, soda can, newspaper, scissors, wrist watch, purse, lighter, compact disc, telephone receiver, full wine bottle, full wine glass, light bulb, lock, padded volleyball, wooden block. (4) As a demonstration of the cups’ strength, the ARL researchers were able to pick up a full bottle of wine using only four of the dime-sized suction cups.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Use in Robotics ==
The self-sealing suction cups have been incorporated in robots to improve their passive grasping capabilities. Due to the design of the suction cups, a central vacuum source can be used to effectively generate suction force from the cups and reduce the number of actuators and sensors for the robot.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessens|first=Chad|date=February 12, 2016|title=Versatile Passive Grasping for Manipulation|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7406751/|journal=IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1293–1302|doi=10.1109/TMECH.2016.2520306|via=IEEE Xplore Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from ARL designed and developed a three-finger hand actuator system using a 3D printer in order for the robot to properly utilize the self-sealing suction cups. Four suction cups run along the bottom of each finger, which contains a narrow vacuum channel running through the center. A central vacuum pump serves to power the suction cups and facilitate grasping. The fingers can also curl around the object to better grasp it and release any object in its hold by feeding back the output of the vacuum pump and emitting a burst of [[positive pressure]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The three-finger hand has been used by aerial systems and has demonstrated considerable success in grasping objects on the ground while maintaining flight. According to ARL researchers, the self-sealing suction cups may exhibit higher rates of success underwater due to the extra pressure from the sea depths surrounding and pressing against the object and grasper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, they noted that an underwater environment would require different manufacturing materials that would allow the suction cups to perform well in salt water, such as a thermal plastic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Sociological naturalism''' is a theory that states that the [[Nature|natural world]] and [[society|social world]] are roughly identical and governed by similar principles. Sociological naturalism, in sociological texts simply referred to as '''naturalism''', can be traced back to the philosophical thinking of [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century, closely connected to [[positivism]], which advocates use of the [[scientific method]] of the [[natural science]]s in studying [[social science]]s. It should not be identified too closely with Positivism, however, since whilst the latter advocates the use of controlled situations like experiments as sources of scientific information, naturalism insists that social processes should only be studied in their ''natural'' setting.  A similar form of naturalism was applied to the scientific study of art and literature by [[Hippolyte Taine]] (see [[Race, milieu, and moment]]).

Contemporary sociologists do not generally dispute that social phenomena take place within the natural universe and, as such, are subject to natural constraints, such as the laws of physics.  Up for debate is the nature of the distinctiveness of social phenomena as a subset of natural phenomena. Broad support exists for the antipositivist claim that crucial qualitative differences mean that one cannot explain social phenomena effectively using investigative tools or even standards of validity derived from other natural sciences. From this point of view, naturalism does not imply [[scientism]].  

However, a classically positivist conflation of naturalism with scientism has not disappeared; this view is still dominant in some old and prestigious schools, such as the sociology departments at the University of Chicago in the United States, and McGill University in Montréal, Canada.

More recently, [[actor-network theory]] has analyzed the social construction of the nature/society distinction itself.

'''Software evolution''' is the term used in [[software engineering]] (specifically [[software maintenance]]) to refer to the process of developing [[software]] initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons. 

==General introduction==
[[Fred Brooks]], in his key book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks]], ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. [[Addison-Wesley]], 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; {{ISBN|0-201-83595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, [[Agile methods]] stem from maintenance-like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]] and [[System migration|migration]].

&lt;!-- evolution of evolution models --&gt;
Software technologies will continue to develop. These changes will require new laws and theories to be created and justified. Some models as well would require additional aspects in developing future programs. Innovations and improvements do increase unexpected form of software development. The maintenance issues also would probably change as to adapt to the evolution of the future software. Software processes are themselves evolving, after going through learning and refinements, it is always improve their efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;aeddy; ref: Understanding Open Source Software Evolution Walt Scacchi Institute for Software Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
The need for software evolution comes from the fact that no one is able to predict how user requirements will evolve ''a priori'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=K. H. | last1=Bennett | first2=V. T. | last2=Rajlich | first3=R. Mohamad | last3=Mazrul, | title = Legacy System: Coping with success | journal=[[IEEE Software]] | date=1995 | pages=19–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words, the existing systems are never complete and continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | author = Trung Hung Vo | title = Software Maintenance| date=  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they evolve, the complexity of the systems will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring functional relevance, reliability and flexibility of the system. Software evolution can be fully manual (based on changes by software engineers), partially automated (e.g. using refactoring tools) or fully automated (with autonomous configuration or evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mony|first3=Cendrine|last4=Chauvel|first4=Franck|last5=Fleurey|first5=Franck|last6=Clarke|first6=Siobhan|date=February 2014|title=DIVERSIFY: Ecology-inspired software evolution for diversity emergence|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6747203/?reload=true|journal=2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/csmr-wcre.2014.6747203|isbn=9781479937523|citeseerx=10.1.1.646.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Software evolution has been greatly impacted by the Internet:

* the rapid growth of World Wide Web and Internet Resources make it easier for users and engineers to find related information. 

* open source development where anybody could download the source codes and hence modify it has enabled fast and parallel evolution (through forks). 

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified the 
three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-04205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the [[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

==Stage model==
Current trends  and practices are projected forward using a new model of software evolution called the staged model [1]. Staged model was introduced to replace conventional analysis which is less suitable for modern software development is rapid changing due to its difficulties of hard to contribute in software evolution. There are five distinct stages contribute in simple staged model (Initial development, Evolution, Servicing, Phase-out, and Close-down). 
* According to K.H.Bennett and V.T Rajlich [1], the key contribution is to separate the 'maintenance' phase into an evolution stage followed by a servicing and phase out stages. The first version of software system which is lacking some features will be developed during initial development or also known as alpha stage [2]. However, the architecture has already been possessed during this stage will bring for any future changes or amendments. Most references in this stage will base on scenarios or case study. Knowledge has defined as another important outcome of initial development. Such knowledge including the knowledge of application domain, user requirements, business rules, policies, solutions, algorithm, etc. Knowledge also seems as the important factor for the subsequent phase of evolution.
* Once the previous stage completed successfully (and must be completed successfully before entering next stage), the next stage would be evolution. Users tend to change their requirements as well as they prefer to see some improvements or changes. Due to this factor, the software industry is facing the challenges of rapid changes environment. Hence the goal of evolution is to adapt the application to the ever-changing user requirements and operating environment [1]. During the previous stage, the first version application created might contain a lot of faults, and those faults will be fixed during evolution stage based on more specified and accurate requirements due to the case study or scenarios.
* The software will continuously evolve until it is no longer evolvable and then enter stage of servicing (also known as software maturity). During this stage, only minor changes will be done.
* Next stage which is phase-out, there is no more servicing available for that particular software. However, the software still in production.
* Lastly, close-down. The software use is disconnected or discontinue [2] and the users are directed towards a replacement.[1].

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
{{Main|Lehman's laws of software evolution}}
Prof. [[Meir M. Lehman]], who worked at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as Lehman's Laws, and there are eight of them:

# (1974) "Continuing Change" — an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory&lt;ref name="laws1-5"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(79)90022-0|last=Lehman|first=M. M.|title=On Understanding Laws, Evolution, and Conservation in the Large-Program Life Cycle|year=1980|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=1|pages=213–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (1974) "Increasing Complexity" — as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1980) "Self Regulation" — E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Organisational Stability ([[invariant work rate]])" - the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Familiarity" — as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average [[incremental growth]] remains invariant as the system evolves.&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1991) "Continuing Growth" — the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime
# (1996) "Declining Quality" — the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes
# (1996) "Feedback System" (first stated 1974, formalised as law 1996) — E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base&lt;ref&gt;[[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth mentioning that the applicability of all of these laws for all types of software systems has been studied by several researchers. For example, see a presentation by Nanjangud C Narendra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Software-Evolution-in-Agile-Development | title=Software Evolution in Agile Development | first=Nanjangud | last=Narendra | website=InfoQ | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a case study of an enterprise Agile project in the light of Lehman’s laws of software evolution. Some empirical observations coming from the study of [[open source software development]] appear to challenge some of the laws {{Vague|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that the need for functional change in a software system is inevitable, and not a consequence of incomplete or incorrect analysis of requirements or bad programming. They state that there are limits to what a software development team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to improve processes, and help to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software as it evolves iteratively{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The "global process" that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as [[system dynamics]] can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be [[Darwinian evolution|Darwinian]], [[Lamarckian evolution|Lamarckian]] or [[Baldwinian evolution|Baldwinian]], but an important phenomenon on its own. Given the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the "fruit fly" of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

'''Suction''' is the flow of a fluid into a partial [[vacuum]], or region of low pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tnuf0g6J5KEC&amp;pg=PA976&amp;dq=suction+is+flow+of+fluid+into+partial+vacuum+-pump&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyu9GZrcbUAhUBwmMKHUS1Cyw4ChDoAQg8MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=suction%20is%20flow%20of%20fluid%20into%20partial%20vacuum%20-pump&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of Mechanical Science, Arts, Manufactures and Miscellaneous Knowledge|last=(LL.D.)|first=Alexander JAMIESON|date=1827|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pressure gradient force|pressure gradient]] between this region and the ambient pressure will propel matter toward the low pressure area. Dust is sucked into a [[vacuum cleaner]] when it is pushed in by the higher pressure air on the outside of the cleaner.

This is similar to what happens when humans breathe or drink through a [[drinking straw|straw]]. Both breathing and using a straw involve contracting the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and muscles around the rib cage. The increased volume in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity decreases the pressure inside, creating an imbalance with the ambient air pressure, or [[atmospheric pressure]]. This imbalance results in air pushing into the lungs or liquid pushing up through a straw and into the mouth.

==Pumps==
{{main|Pump}}
{{also|Suction pump}}
[[Pumps]] typically have an inlet where the fluid (or air) enters the pump and an outlet where the fluid/air comes out. The inlet location is said to be at the '''suction side''' of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the '''discharge side''' of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid/air can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the discharge side by forcing the fluid/air out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a [[centrifugal pump]] is too high, a device may trigger the fluid pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.

Under normal conditions of [[atmospheric pressure]] suction can draw pure water up to a maximum height of approximately 10.3 m (33.9 [[Foot (length)|feet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Calvert|2000|loc="[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump]"}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Suction (medicine)|In medicine, suction]] devices are used to clear airways of materials that would like to impede breathing or cause infections, to aid in surgery, and for other purposes.

[[File:EarthTransit2084.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon transiting the Sun in 2084, as seen from Mars. Image created using JPL Solar System Simulator&lt;!--In case we reach 2084 and can't get an image :) --&gt;]]
[[File:Earth and Moon from Mars PIA04531.jpg|thumb|Earth and Moon from Mars, as photographed by the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]]]

A '''[[astronomical transit|transit]] of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars''' takes place when the planet [[Earth]] passes directly between the [[Sun]] and [[Mars]], obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its [[ascending node]] are in May, those at [[descending node]] happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 [[synodic period]]s, and is analogous to the cycle of [[transit of Venus|transits of Venus from Earth]], which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084.&lt;ref name="Mars2084"/&gt; The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.&lt;ref name="Earth1984"/&gt;

During the event, the [[Moon]] could almost always  also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any [[defect of illumination]]. During the 1879 event, this permitted [[Charles Augustus Young]] to attempt a careful measurement of the [[oblateness]] (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using [[radar]] from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including ''[[Mariner 9]]'', ''[[Viking 1]]'', ''[[Viking 2]]'', and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A [[science fiction]] short story published in 1971 by [[Arthur C. Clarke]],  called "Transit of Earth", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November [[5th millennium|4356]]. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December [[6th millennium|5934]].

The simultaneous occurrence of a [[Transit of Venus from Mars|transit of Venus]] and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year [[Timeline of the far future#Astronomical events|571,471]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">'''Vacuum cementing''' or '''vacuum welding''' is the natural process of solidifying small objects in a hard [[vacuum]].  The most notable example is [[Lunar dust|dust]] on the surface of the [[Moon]].

This effect was reported to be a problem with the first [[United States|American]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] satellites, as small moving parts would seize together.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2009 the [[European Space Agency]] published a peer-reviewed paper detailing why [[cold welding]] is a significant issue that [[spacecraft]] designers need to carefully consider. The conclusions of this appropriately titled study can be found on page 25 of "Assessment of Cold Welding between Separable Contact Surfaces due to Impact and Fretting under Vacuum". The paper also cites a documented example from 1991 with the [[Galileo spacecraft]] [[high-gain antenna]] (see page 2; the technical source document from [[NASA]] regarding the Galileo spacecraft is also provided in a link here).&lt;ref&gt;http://esmat.esa.int/Publications/Published_papers/STM-279.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/32404/1/94-0141.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of difficulty is that vacuum (aka cold) welding does not exclude relative motion between the surfaces that are to be joined. This allows the broadly defined notions of [[galling]], [[fretting]], sticking, [[stiction]] and [[adhesion]] to overlap in some instances. For example, it is possible for a joint to be the result of both vacuum welding and galling (and/or fretting and/or impact). Galling and vacuum welding, therefore, are not mutually exclusive.

[[File:The Corryvreckan Whirlpool - geograph-2404815-by-Walter-Baxter.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|The [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]] whirlpool in Scotland is the third largest whirlpool in the world]]
A '''whirlpool''' is a body of rotating [[water]] produced by the meeting of opposing currents.{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|reason=Is this universally true?|date=August 2018}} The vast majority of whirlpools are not very powerful and very small whirlpools can be easily seen when a bath or a sink is draining. More powerful ones in seas or oceans may be termed '''''maelstroms'''''. ''[[Vortex]]'' is the proper term for any whirlpool that has a [[downdraft]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In oceans, in narrow straits with fast flowing water, whirlpools are normally caused by [[tides]]; there are few stories of large ships ever being sucked into such a maelstrom, although smaller craft are in danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webecoist.com/2009/07/24/10-magnificent-maelstroms-and-destructive-whirlpools 10 Magnificent Maelstroms]. WebEcoist. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller whirlpools also appear at the base of many [[waterfall]]s&lt;ref name="fenh"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Family Encyclopedia of Natural History |editor1-first=Rosalind |editor1-last=Carreck |date=1982 |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |isbn=0-7112-0225-7 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be observed downstream from manmade structures such as [[weir]]s and dams. In the case of powerful waterfalls, like [[Niagara Falls]], these whirlpools can be quite strong.

As navigation is dangerous in this strait only a small slot of time is available for large ships to pass through.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt; Its impressive strength is caused by the world's strongest tide occurring in the same location during the new and full moon. A narrow channel of {{convert|3|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} length connects the outer Saltfjord with its extension, the large [[Skjerstadfjorden|Skjerstadfjord]], causing a colossal tide which in turn produces the Saltstraumen maelstrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Saltstraumen|title=Saltstraumen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Store Norske Leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moskstraumen ===
{{main|Moskstraumen}}
Moskstraumen is an unusual system of whirlpools in the open seas in the [[Lofoten Islands]] off the [[Norway|Norwegian coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1958 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second strongest whirlpool in the world with flow currents reaching speeds as high as {{convert|32|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. It finds mention in several books and movies.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt;

The Moskstraumen is formed by the combination of powerful semi-diurnal tides and the unusual shape of the [[seabed]], with a shallow ridge between the [[Moskenesøya]] and [[Værøy]] islands which amplifies and whirls the tidal currents.&lt;ref name="Compton2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWwQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|title=Why Sailors Can't Swim and Other Marvellous Maritime Curiosities|last=Compton|first=Nic|date=28 July 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-9263-4|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corryvreckan ===
{{main|Corryvreckan}}
[[File:Corryvreckan.jpg|thumb|Corryvreckan whirlpool]]
The Corryvreckan is a narrow [[strait]] between the islands of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] and [[Scarba]], in [[Argyll and Bute]], on the northern side of the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan]], [[Scotland]]. It is the third-largest whirlpool in the world.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012"/&gt; Flood [[tides]] and inflow from the [[Firth of Lorne]] to the west can drive the waters of Corryvreckan to waves of over {{convert|9|metres}}, and the roar of the resulting maelstrom, which reaches speeds of {{convert|18|km/h|abbr=on}}, can be heard {{convert|16|km|mi}} away. Though it was initially classified as non-navigable by the [[British navy]] it was later categorized as "extremely dangerous".&lt;ref name="Doyle2012"/&gt;

A documentary team from Scottish independent producers [[Northlight Productions]] once threw a [[mannequin]] into the Corryvreckan ("the Hag") with a [[Personal flotation device|life jacket]] and depth gauge. The mannequin was swallowed and spat up far down current with a depth gauge reading of {{convert|262|m|ft}} with evidence of being dragged along the bottom for a great distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/680755 |title=Equinox: Lethal Seas}} UK and US co-production by Northlight, "Lethal Seas" UK Channel 4, "Sea Twister!"

[[Old Sow whirlpool]] is located between Deer Island, [[New Brunswick]], Canada, and Moose Island, Eastport, [[Maine]], USA. It is given the epithet "pig-like" as it makes a screeching noise when the vortex is at its full fury and reaches speeds of up to {{convert|27.6|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt; The smaller whirlpools around this Old Sow are known as "Piglets.&lt;ref name="Doyle2012" /&gt;

The [[Naruto whirlpools]] are located in the Naruto Strait near Awaji Island in Japan, which have speeds of {{convert|26|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt;

[[Skookumchuck Narrows]] is a tidal rapids that develops whirlpools, on the [[Sunshine Coast (British Columbia)|Sunshine Coast]], Canada with current speeds exceeding {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Compton2013" /&gt;

[[French Pass]] ({{lang|fr|Te Aumiti}}) is a narrow and treacherous stretch of water that separates D'Urville Island from the north end of the South Island of New Zealand. In 2000 a whirlpool there caught student divers, resulting in fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://divenewzealand.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/frenchpass.pdf|format=PDF|last=Smith|first=I R|title=In the matter of an inquest into the deaths of Narelle Taniko te Purei, Ricki Graeme McDonald and Michael David Welsh|date=14 April 2003|publisher=Nelson District Coroner|via=Dive New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a short-lived whirlpool that sucked in a portion of the 1300 acre (~530 hectares) [[Lake Peigneur]] in [[Louisiana, United States]] after a drilling mishap in November 1980. This was not a naturally occurring whirlpool, but a man-made disaster caused by underwater drillers breaking through the roof of a salt mine. The lake then drained into the mine until the mine filled and the water levels equalized but the ten-foot deep lake was now 1,300 feet deep. This mishap resulted in destruction of five houses, loss of nineteen barges and eight tug boats, oil rigs, a mobile home, and most of a botanical garden. The adjacent settlement of Jefferson Island was reduced in area by 10%. A crater 0.5-mile (~1km) across was left behind. Nine of the barges which had sunk floated back.&lt;ref name="Pile2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Pile|title=The Not Terribly Good Book of Heroic Failures: An intrepid selection from the original volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_qS4RW5nw0C&amp;pg=PT146|date=4 October 2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=978-0-571-27734-6|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heggen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Heggen|title=Underground Rivers: From the River Styx to the Rio San Buenaventura, with occasional diversions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zczBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1108|date=16 January 2015|publisher=Richard Heggen|pages=1108–|id=GGKEY:BS7JB1BB957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Recovery&gt;{{cite web|url= http://members.tripod.com/%7Eearthdude1/texaco/texaco.html |title= And away goes the lake down the drain!|accessdate=23 May 2016|publisher=Archive of tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example of a man-made whirlpool that received significant media coverage was in early June 2015, when an intake vortex formed in [[Lake Texoma]], on the Oklahoma–Texas border, near the floodgates of the dam that forms the lake. At the time of the whirlpool's formation, the lake was being drained after reaching its highest level ever. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], which operates the dam and lake, expected that the whirlpool would last until the lake reached normal seasonal levels by late July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/Levels-at-Lake-Texoma-decrease-rare-look-at-intake-vortex-306557501.html |title=Levels at Lake Texoma decrease; rare look at intake vortex |first=Chelsi |last=Smith |publisher=[[KXII]]-TV |location=Sherman, TX |date=8 June 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dangers ==
[[File:'Edgard Poë et ses oeuvres' by Lix and Dargent 5.jpg|thumb|An illustration from Jules Verne's essay "Edgard Poë et ses oeuvres" (''Edgar Poe and his Works'', 1862) drawn by Frederic Lix or Yan' Dargent]]
Powerful whirlpools have killed unlucky seafarers, but their power tends to be exaggerated by laymen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/episode56 MythBusters Episode 56: Killer Whirlpool]. Mythbustersresults.com. Retrieved 26 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There are virtually no stories of large ships ever being sucked into a whirlpool. Tales like those by [[Paul the Deacon]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Jules Verne]] are entirely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul the Deacon]], ''[[History of the Lombards]]'' (8th century AD); [[Edgar Allan Poe]], "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841); and [[Jules Verne]], ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, temporary whirlpools caused by major engineering disasters are capable of submerging large ships. A prominent example is the drilling disaster that occurred on November 20, 1980, in [[Lake Peigneur]]. A drilling platform, eleven barges, several trees, and multiple acres of the surrounding terrain were submerged by the resulting whirlpool. Days after the disaster, once the water pressure equalized, nine of the eleven sunken barges popped out of the whirlpool and refloated on the lake's surface.

== In literature and popular culture ==
Apart from Poe and Verne other literary source is of the 1500s, of [[Olaus Magnus]], a Swedish Bishop, who had stated that the maelstrom which was more powerful than ''The Odyssey'' destroyed ships which sank to the bottom of the sea, and even whales were sucked in. [[Pytheas]], the Greek historian, also mentioned that maelstroms swallowed ships and threw them up again.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Charybdis]] in [[Greek mythology]] was later rationalized as a whirlpool, which sucked entire ships into its fold in the narrow coast of [[Sicily]], a disaster faced by navigators.&lt;ref name="Andrews2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Tamra |title=Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513677-7|page=171|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century, [[Paul the Deacon]], who had lived among the Belgii, described [[tidal bore]]s and the maelstrom for a Mediterranean audience unused to such violent tidal surges:&lt;ref name="Deacon2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deacon|first=Paul the |title=History of the Lombards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt3jZ69vJKQC&amp;pg=PA8|date=3 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0558-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Not very far from this shore … toward the western side, on which the ocean main lies open without end, is that very deep whirlpool of waters which we call by its familiar name "the navel of the sea." This is said to suck in the waves and spew them forth again twice every day. … They say there is another whirlpool of this kind between the island of Britain and the province of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and with this fact the coasts of the Seine region and of Aquitaine agree, for they are filled twice a day with such sudden inundations that any one who may by chance be found only a little inward from the shore can hardly get away. I have heard a certain high nobleman of the [[Gaul]]s relating that a number of ships, shattered at first by a tempest, were afterwards devoured by this same [[Charybdis]]. And when one only out of all the men who had been in these ships, still breathing, swam over the waves, while the rest were dying, he came, swept by the force of the receding waters, up to the edge of that most frightful abyss. And when now he beheld yawning before him the deep chaos whose end he could not see, and half dead from very fear, expected to be hurled into it, suddenly in a way that he could not have hoped he was cast upon a certain rock and sat him down.|source=Paul the Deacon, ''History of the Lombards'', i.6}}

Three of the most notable literary references to the Lofoten Maelstrom date from the nineteenth century. The first is the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841). The second is ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870), the famous novel by [[Jules Verne]]. At the end of this novel, [[Captain Nemo]] seems to commit suicide, sending his ''Nautilus'' submarine into the Maelstrom (although in Verne's [[The Mysterious Island|sequel]] Nemo and the Nautilus were seen to have survived). The "Norway maelstrom" is also mentioned in [[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Herman Melville ''Moby-Dick'' [[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 36|Chapter 36]], Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'Life of [[St Columba]]', the author, [[Adomnan of Iona]]', attributes to the saint miraculous knowledge of a particular bishop who ran into a whirlpool off the coast of Ireland. In Adomnan's narrative, he quotes Columba saying&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Cólman mac Beognai has set sail to come here, and is now in great danger in the surging tides of the whirlpool of Corryvreckan. Sitting in the prow, he lifts up his hands to heaven and blesses the turbulent, terrible seas. Yet the Lord terrifies him in this way, not so that the ship in which he sits should be overwhelmed and wrecked by the waves, but rather to rouse him to pray more fervently that he may sail through the peril and reach us here.}}

== Etymology ==
One of the earliest uses in English of the [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]] word (''malström'' or ''malstrøm'') was by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in his short story "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]" (1841). In turn, the Nordic word is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''maelstrom'', modern spelling ''maalstroom'', from ''malen'' (''to grind'') and ''stroom'' (''stream''), to form the meaning ''grinding current'' or literally "mill-stream", in the sense of milling (grinding) grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Compared to the preindustrial era, wildland land fire in the [[conterminous U.S.]] has been reduced 90 percent with proportional reductions in wildland fire emissions. Land use changes ([[agricultur]]e and [[urbanization]]) are responsible for roughly 50 percent of this decrease, and land management decisions (land [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], [[Wildfire suppression|suppression]] actions, etc.) are responsible for the remainder. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] activities (e.g., [[industrial production]], [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], etc.) today have more than replaced the lost preindustrial wildland fire atmospheric emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Leenhouts, B. 1998.Assessment of biomass burning in the conterminous United States.

[[File:Baldung Hexen 1508 kol.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|''Witches'' by [[Hans Baldung]]. Woodcut, 1508]]
'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

==== White witches ====

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance. Witchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf |title=A Global Issue that Demands Action |publisher=the Academic Council on the United Nations System (ACUNS) Vienna Liaison Office |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1 |title=CONFLICT BETWEEN STATE LEGAL NORMS AND NORMS UNDERLYING POPULAR BELIEFS: WITCHCRAFT IN AFRICA AS A CASE STUDY |publisher=DUKE JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE &amp; INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol 14:351 |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |title=WITCH HUNTS IN MODERN SOUTH AFRICA: AN UNDER-REPRESENTED FACET OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE |publisher=MRC-UNISA Crime, Violence and Injury Lead Programm |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425074549/http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/opinions/columns/AHRC-ETC-056-2011 |title=NEPAL: Witchcraft as a Superstition and a form of violence against women in Nepal — Asian Human Rights Commission |publisher=Humanrights.asia |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mensah Adinkrah |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/10/4/325.abstract |title=Witchcraft Accusations and Female Homicide Victimization in Contemporary Ghana |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=325–356 |date=2004-04-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07|doi=10.1177/1077801204263419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kenya ====
It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011. Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi; Consultancy Africa Intelligence (16 June):&lt;/ref&gt; Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meer, Erwin 2011. The Problem of Witchcraft in Malawi, Evangelical Missions Quarterly (47:1, January): 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kuranko language]], the term for witchcraft is ''suwa'ye''&lt;ref&gt;West, Harry G. "''Ethnographic Sorcery''" (p.24); 2007. The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-89398-3}} (pbk.), {{ISBN|0-226-89398-7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "extraordinary powers".

==== Tanzania ====
In [[Tanzania]] in 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly condemned [[witchdoctor]]s for killing [[Albinism|albinos]] for their body parts, which are thought to bring good luck. 25 albinos have been murdered since March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7518049.stm Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, albinos are often murdered for their body parts on the advice of witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/blogs/?p=348|title=Wicasta 2011.

=== Americas ===
==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

==== Colonial North America ====
[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-91265-4|page=85|author=George Brown Tindall|edition=Brief Ninth Edition, Volume One|author2=David Emory Shi |editor=Jon Durbin. Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been.

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H. Henrietta|last3=Krueger|first3=Victoria|title=Medicine women, curanderas, and women doctors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApJayEh43ZcC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2512-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the ''{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}'' is a curse and disease, usually indicated by an immediate action to administration of the poison, like fainting, swelling of the tongue, or [[Trismus|lockjaw]]. Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Traditional Navajos usually hesitate to discuss things like witches and witchcraft with non-Navajos.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016.

Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

Apart from other types of [[Violence against women]] in [[Nepal]], the malpractice of abusing women in the name of witchcraft is also really prominent.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

=== Europe ===
{{Main article|European witchcraft|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}
[[File:Die Hexe (Albrecht Dürer).jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht Dürer]] circa 1500: Witch Riding Backwards On A Goat]]
[[File:Sejdmen.jpg|thumb|During the Christianisation of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had male [[völva]]s (shamans) tied up and left on a [[skerry]] at [[tide|ebb]].]]Witchcraft in Europe between 500–1750 was believed to be a combination of sorcery and heresy. While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E. William|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the witch accusations in Europe took place in the 14th and 15th centuries; however as the social disruptions of the 16th century took place, witchcraft trials intensified.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witch Trials: Their Foundations in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300–1500|last=Kiekhefer|first=Richard|publisher=Routledge|year=201|isbn=|location=|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of witches.  Current scholarly estimates of the number of people executed for witchcraft vary between about 40,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title = Estimates of executions | url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/remembrance/current.htm }} Based on [[Ronald Hutton]]'s essay ''Counting the Witch Hunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Early Modern European tradition, witches were stereotypically, though not exclusively, women.&lt;ref name="gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny (1998) "Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt" in [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM ''The Pomegranate''] #5, Lammas 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill (1992) ''Dictionary of Mysticism and the Esoteric Traditions'' Revised Edition. Bridport, Dorset: Prism Press. "Witch".&lt;/ref&gt; European pagan belief in witchcraft was associated with the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and dismissed as "diabolical fantasies" by medieval Christian authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regino of Prüm]] (906), see Ginzburg (1990) part 2, ch. 1 (89ff.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witch-hunt]]s first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest [[Germany]] were from 1561 to 1670.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. [[Erik Midelfort]], Witch Hunting in Southwestern Germany 1562–1684, 1972,71&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commonly believed that individuals with power and prestige were involved in acts of witchcraft and even cannibalism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thornton, John. "Cannibals, Witches, and Slave Traders in the Atlantic World." The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.
[[File:Torturing and execution of witches in medieval miniature.jpg|thumb|Burning witches, with others held in Stocks, 14th century]]
The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500."

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community."

=====21st century=====
In the [[United Kingdom]] children believed to be witches or seen as possessed by evil spirits can be subject to severe beatings, traumatic [[exorcism]], and/or other abuse.  There have even been child murders associated with witchcraft beliefs.  The problem is particularly serious among immigrant or former immigrant communities of African origin but other communities, such as those of Asian origin are also involved.  Step children and children seen as different for a wide range of reasons are particularly at risk of witchcraft accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protectingchildren.org.uk/cp-topics/cultural-themes/witchcraft/ |title=Witchcraft – Child protection – Child abuse – Child rights |website=Protectingchildren.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302063932/http://www.protectingchildren.org.uk/cp-topics/cultural-themes/witchcraft/ |archivedate=2017-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may be beaten or have chilli rubbed into their eyes during exorcisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36300200 Witchcraft child abuse cases investigated by Met rise by over 50% ''BBC'']&lt;/ref&gt; This type of abuse is frequently hidden and can include torture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/more-cases-ritual-child-abuse-linked-witchcraft-beliefs-reported-police Rise in cases of [[ritual child abuse]] linked to witchcraft beliefs reported, say police] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 recommendation to record abuse cases linked to witchcraft centrally has not yet been implemented.

==== Cook Islands ====
In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will.

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nothing could be done about it LACMA 63.11.24.jpg|thumb|Goya's drawing of result of a presumed witch's trial: " [so she must be a witch]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Inquisition Unmasked: Being an Historical and Philosophical Account of that Tremendous Tribunal, Founded on Authentic Documents; and Exhibiting the Necessity of Its Suppression, as a Means of Reform and Regeneration, Written and Published at a Time when the National Congress of Spain was about to Deliberate on this Important Measure|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aqRCAAAAYAAJ|publisher = Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|date = 1816-01-01|first = Antonio|last = Puigblanch}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Wood''' is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the [[Plant stem|stems]] and roots of [[tree]]s and other [[woody plant]]s. It is an [[organic material]], a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.|date=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and [[nutrient]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]], other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.

Wood has been used for thousands of years for [[fuel]], as a [[construction material]], for making [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] and [[paper]]. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as [[cellophane]] and [[cellulose acetate#production|cellulose acetate]].

As of 2005, the growing stock of [[forest]]s worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters, 47% of which was commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/A0400E/A0400E06.pdf|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an abundant, [[carbon-neutral]] renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy. In 1991 approximately 3.5 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Horst H. Nimz, Uwe Schmitt, Eckart Schwab, Otto Wittmann, Franz Wolf "Wood" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A 2011 discovery in the [[Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]] yielded the earliest known plants to have grown wood, approximately 395 to 400 [[million years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|title=N.B. fossils show origins of wood|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011|date=August 12, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813012432/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2011/08/12/nb-origins-of-wood-found.html|archivedate=August 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philippe Gerrienne et al.|title=A Simple Type of Wood in Two Early Devonian Plants|journal=Science|volume=333|issue=6044|pages=837|date=Aug 12, 2011|doi=10.1126/science.1208882|pmid=21836008|bibcode=2011Sci...333..837G|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/jspui/handle/2268/97121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can be dated by [[carbon dating]] and in some species by [[dendrochronology]] to determine when a wooden object was created.

People have used wood for thousands of years for many purposes, including as a [[fuel]] or as a [[construction]] material for making [[house]]s, [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]], [[packaging]], [[artwork]]s, and [[paper]]. Known [[construction]]s using wood date back ten thousand years. Buildings like the European Neolithic long house were made primarily of wood.

Recent use of wood has been enhanced by the addition of steel and bronze into construction.&lt;ref name="A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sarah|title=A History of Wood from the Stone Age to the 21st Century|url=http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|website=EcoBUILDING|publisher=A Publication of The American Institute of Architects|accessdate=March 28, 2017|ref=3|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329051421/http://www.ecobuildingpulse.com/products/a-history-of-wood_o|archivedate=March 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[tree]] showing idealized vertical and horizontal sections. A new layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and [[root]]s, to form a [[growth ring]].]]

===Growth rings===
{{main article|Growth rings}}

Wood, in the strict sense, is yielded by [[tree]]s, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as [[secondary growth]]; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].

Where the differences between the four seasons are distinct, e.g. [[New Zealand]], growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. [[Singapore]]), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.

If there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212121121/http://farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html |date=December 12, 2009 }} www.farmforestline.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).

===Knots===
&lt;!--[[Wood knot]] and [[Knot (wood)]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|left|A knot on a tree trunk]]

As a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base, and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular "solid" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood "flows" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.

In the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.

In grading [[lumber]] and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.

[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|upright|Wood knot in vertical section]]
{{quote|''Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than when under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.''|Samuel J. Record|The Mechanical Properties of Wood&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book

Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber, this will depend on the size and location. Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.

In some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution ([[knotting (wood treatment)|knotting]]), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.

Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.&lt;ref&gt;Shigo, Alex. (1986) ''A New Tree Biology Dictionary''. Shigo and Trees, Associates. {{ISBN|0943563127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood, and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.

Sapwood (or alburnum&lt;ref name="eb-alburnum"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum|volume=1|page=516|short=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,&lt;ref&gt;Capon, Brian (2005), Botany for Gardeners (2nd ed.), Portland, OR: Timber Publishing, p. 65 {{ISBN|0881926558}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.

The term ''heartwood'' derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[hickory]], [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IbjPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=The+term+heartwood+derives+solely+from+its+position+and+not+from+any+vital+importance+to+the+tree+as+a+tree+can+thrive+with+heart+completely+decayed#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20term%20heartwood%20derives%20solely%20from%20its%20position%20and%20not%20from%20any%20vital%20importance%20to%20the%20tree%20as%20a%20tree%20can%20thrive%20with%20heart%20completely%20decayed&amp;f=false|title=The Mechanical Properties of Wood: Including a Discussion of the Factors Affecting the Mechanical Properties, and Methods of Timber Testing|last=Record|first=Samuel James|date=1914|publisher=J.

No definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.

When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.

It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.

Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.

===Color===
[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] is distinctively red.]]
In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.

Some experiments on very resinous [[longleaf pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called "fat lighter". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.

Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.

Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.

===Water content===
Water occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:
* in the [[cell wall]]s,
* in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[cell (biology)|cells]]
* as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem

In heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8–16% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.

The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.

Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&amp;nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.

The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book

===Structure===

Wood is a [[heterogeneous]], [[hygroscopic]], [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] material. It consists of cells, and the cell walls are composed of micro-fibrils of [[cellulose]] (40–50%) and [[hemicellulose]] (15–25%) impregnated with [[lignin]] (15–30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|title=Wood Properties Growth and Structure 2015|work=treetesting.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313044617/http://treetesting.com/wood_properties_growth_and_structure.htm|archivedate=March 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coniferous or [[softwood]] species the wood cells are mostly of one kind, [[tracheid]]s, and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most [[hardwood]]s. There are no vessels ("pores") in coniferous wood such as one sees so prominently in oak and ash, for example.

The structure of hardwoods is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalvetcontent.edu.au/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/b2f0fcee-47cb-4650-b248-f533d73d5428/13_05/toolbox13_05/unit9_selecting_timber/section2_characteristics/lesson2_hardwood.htm|title=Timber Plus Toolbox, Selecting timber, Characteristics of timber, Structure of hardwoods|work=nationalvetcontent.edu.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810184152/https://nationalvetcontent.edu.au/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/b2f0fcee-47cb-4650-b248-f533d73d5428/13_05/toolbox13_05/unit9_selecting_timber/section2_characteristics/lesson2_hardwood.htm|archivedate=August 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by [[vessel element|vessels]]: in some cases (oak, chestnut, ash) these are quite large and distinct, in others ([[Aesculus|buckeye]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[willow]]) too small to be seen without a hand lens. In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes, ''ring-porous'' and ''diffuse-porous''.&lt;ref name=sperry1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sperry|first=John S. |author2=Nichols, Kirk L. |author3=Sullivan, June E. |author4=Eastlack, Sondra E.|title=Xylem Embolism in ring-porous, diffuse-porous, and coniferous trees of Northern Utah and Interior Alaska |journal=Ecology |date=1994 |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=1736–1752 |jstor=1939633 |doi=10.2307/1939633 |url=http://bioweb.biology.utah.edu/sperry/publications/Sperry%20et%20al.%201994%20Ecology.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ring-porous species, such as ash, black locust, [[catalpa]], chestnut, [[elm]], hickory, [[mulberry]], and oak,&lt;ref name=sperry1994/&gt; the larger vessels or pores (as cross sections of vessels are called) are localized in the part of the growth ring formed in spring, thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue. The rest of the ring, produced in summer, is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers. These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row.

===Earlywood and latewood===

====In softwood====
[[File:Wood Pseudotsuga taxifolia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a softwood; radial view, growth rings closely spaced in [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]]]]
In temperate softwoods, there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.

If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pines]] there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.

It is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.

No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.

====In ring-porous woods====
[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''; tangential view, wide growth rings]]
In ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.

In the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.

In ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.

Wide-ringed wood is often called "second-growth", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such "second-growth" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:
:"The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7–1.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5–0.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–1.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3–5 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough."&lt;ref name=USforest&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory. ''[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm The Wood Handbook: Wood as an engineering material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315214043/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm |date=March 15, 2007 }}''. General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:

:"When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter."&lt;ref name=USforest/&gt;

====In diffuse-porous woods====
In the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.

In diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.

===Monocot wood===
[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|Trunks of the [[coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]
Structural material that resembles ordinary, "dicot" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.

===Specific gravity===
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986),&lt;ref name="tim"&gt;Timell, T.E. 1986. Compression wood in gymnosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 2150 p.&lt;/ref&gt; as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as ''basic specific gravity'' (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt;

===Wood density===

{{See also|Janka hardness test}}

Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “one fairly easily measured wood characteristic” (Elliott 1970).&lt;ref name="ell"&gt;Elliott, G.K. 1970. Wood density in conifers. Commonwealth For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Commun. 8. 44 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Age, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, [[silviculture|silvicultural]] treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986).&lt;ref name="tim" /&gt; Variation of specific gravity within the [[trunk (botany)|bole]] of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.

==Hard and soft woods==

It is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.

There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].

==Chemistry of wood==
[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of [[lignin]], which comprises about 25% of wood dry matter and is responsible for many of its properties.]]
The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]]) by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mémotech Bois et Matériaux Associés|date=1996|publisher=Éditions Casteilla|location=Paris|isbn=978-2713516450|page=22|author= Jean-Pierre Barette|author2= Claude Hazard et Jérôme Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also contains [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other elements in small quantity.

Aside from water, wood has three main components. [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%. Next in abundance is [[hemicellulose]], which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. [[Lignin]] is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.

In chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]]. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]]. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.&lt;ref name=boerjan&gt;{{cite journal| author = W.

===Extractives===
Aside from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulose]], wood consists of a variety of low [[molecular weight]] [[organic compound]]s, called ''extractives''. The wood [[extract]]ives are [[fatty acid]]s, [[resin acid]]s, [[wax]]es and [[terpene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Mimms |first = Agneta |author2=Michael J. Kuckurek |author3=Jef A.

==Uses==

===Fuel===
{{Main article|Wood fuel}}
Wood has a long history of being used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jFvrF4DaZcgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+has+a+long+history+of+being+used+as+fuel#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20has%20a%20long%20history%20of%20being%20used%20as%20fuel&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Fuels and the Environment|last=Sterrett|first=Frances S.|date=1994-10-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0873719780|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to this day, mostly in rural areas of the world. Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.

===Construction===

[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&amp;nbsp;– Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=December 16, 2008 }}",''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Wood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).

Wood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America. Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA7-PA15&amp;dq=%C2%A0Wood+to+be+used+for+construction+work+is+commonly+known+as+lumber+in+North+America#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Wood%20to%20be%20used%20for%20construction%20work%20is%20commonly%20known%20as%20lumber%20in%20North%20America&amp;f=false|title=Materials for Interior Environments|last=Binggeli|first=Corky|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1118421604|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[Populus|poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].

[[File:Преображенская церковь (деревянная) (1714 г.) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]
New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.

In buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.

Wood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mold into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.

====Wood flooring====
[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]
{{Main article |Wood flooring}}A solid wood floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a single piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses moisture from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.

Solid hardwood flooring is usually cheaper than engineered timbers and damaged areas can be sanded down and refinished repeatedly, the number of times being limited only by the thickness of wood above the tongue.

Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors as well as most traditional wood blocks, [[mosaic]]s and [[parquetry]].

====Engineered wood====
{{main article |Engineered wood}}

Engineered wood products, glued building products "engineered" for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.&lt;ref name="apawood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf|title=APA – The Engineered Wood Association|work=apawood.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627045932/http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed%2FE30.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL) products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.&lt;ref name="apawood" /&gt; Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.

Wood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic materials]]. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].

===Furniture and utensils===
Wood has always been used extensively for [[furniture]], such as [[chairs]] and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]] and [[pencil]].

===Next generation wood products===
Further developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|title=FPInnovations|work=forintek.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319100903/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.&lt;ref&gt;"System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements" I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the arts===
[[File:Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion MET DP371962.jpg|thumb|''[[Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion]]'', [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]]]
Wood has long been used as an [[media (arts)|artistic medium]]. It has been used to make sculptures and [[wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'').

Other uses of wood in the arts include:
* [[Woodcut]] [[printmaking]] and [[wood engraving|engraving]]
* Wood can be a surface to paint on, such as in [[panel painting]]
* Many [[musical instrument]]s are made mostly or entirely of wood

===Sports and recreational equipment===
Many types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]]. The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA|parquetry]].

Many other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[titanium]] or [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]]. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] commonly known as the ''[[wood (golf)|woods]]'', the heads of which were traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of [[Wood (golf)#Drivers|drivers]]) carbon-fiber composites.

==Bacterial degradation==
Little is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose. [[Symbiotic bacteria]] in ''[[Xylophaga]]'' may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood; while bacteria such as ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', ''[[Flavobacteria]]'', ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', ''[[Clostridia]]'', and ''[[Bacteroidetes]]'' have been detected in wood submerged over a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life|author1=Christina Bienhold|author2=Petra Pop Ristova|author3=Frank Wenzhöfer|author4=Thorsten Dittmar|author5=Antje Boetius|journal=PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue=1|pages=e53590|date=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053590|pmid=23301092|pmc=3534711|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853590B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zeta potential titration''' is a [[titration]] of [[heterogeneous]] systems, for example  [[colloid]]s and [[emulsion]]s. Solids in such systems have very high [[surface area]]. This type of titration is used to study the [[zeta potential]] of these [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]s under different conditions.

[[File:Titration Zeta.gif|thumb|500px|Zeta potential titrations of concentrated [[alumina]] and [[rutile]] dispersions]]

==Iso-electric Point==

The [[iso-electric point]] is one such property. The iso-electric point is the pH value at which the [[zeta potential]] is approximately zero. At a pH near the iso-electric point (± 2 pH units), colloids are usually unstable; the particles tend to [[coagulation|coagulate]] or [[flocculation|flocculate]]. Such titrations use acids or bases as titration [[reagent]]s. Tables of iso-electric points for different materials are available.&lt;ref name=Kosmulski2001&gt;{{citation | last=Kosmulski | first=Marek | title = Chemical properties of Material Surfaces | series = Surfactant Science Series | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2001 | isbn=978-0-8247-0560-2 | volume = 102)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attached figure illustrates results of such titrations for concentrated dispersions of [[alumina]] (4% v/v) and [[rutile]] (7% v/v). It is seen that iso-electric point of alumina is around pH 9.3, whereas for rutile it is around pH 4. Alumina is unstable in the pH range from 7 to 11. Rutile is unstable in the pH range from 2 to 6.

==Surfactants and Stabilization==

Another purpose of this titration is determination of the optimum dose of [[surfactant]] for achieving [[chemical stability|stabilization]] or [[flocculation]] of a heterogeneous system. Examples can be found in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref name=Dukhin2002&gt;{{citation | last=Dukhin | first=Andrei S. | last2 = Goetz | first2 = Philip J. | title = Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date=2002 | isbn=978-0-444-51164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

In a zeta-potential titration, the [[Zeta potential]] is the [[wikt:indicator|indicator]]. Measurement of the '''zeta potential''' can be performed using [[microelectrophoresis]], or [[electrophoretic light scattering]], or [[electroacoustic phenomena]]. The last method makes possible to perform titrations in concentrated systems, with no dilution. The book by Dukhin and Goetz provides a detailed description of such titrations.
