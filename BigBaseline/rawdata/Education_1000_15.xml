The '''Carolina Abecedarian Project''' was a [[Scientific control|controlled]] [[experiment]] that was conducted in 1972 in [[North Carolina]], [[United States]], by the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute]] to study the potential benefits of [[early childhood education]] for poor children to enhance school readiness. It has been found that in their earliest school years, poor children lag behind others, suggesting the fact that they were ill-prepared for schooling. &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, K. L., &amp; Entwisle, D. R. (1988). Achievement in the first 2 years of school: Patterns and processes. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 53 (Serial No. 218)&lt;/ref&gt; The Abecedarian project was inspired by the fact that few other early childhood programs could provide a sufficiently well-controlled environment to determine the effectiveness of early childhood training.

==Overview==
The participants in this experiment were 111 infants born between 1972 and 1977. Of these, 57 were given high-quality intervention, consisting in part of educational games based on the latest in educational theory. The other 54 acted as a control group. An overwhelming majority (98 percent) of the children who participated in the experiment were [[African-American]]. The average starting age of participants was 4.4 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm Child Trends: Guide to Effective Programs for Children and Youth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712144221/http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm |date=July 12, 2006 }}, Child Trends 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas other childhood programs started at age two, the Abecedarian Project started from [[infancy]] and continued for five years, a period longer than most other programs. The participants received child care for 6&amp;ndash;8 hours a day, five days a week. Educational activities were game-based and emphasized language. The control group was provided with [[nutritional supplement]]s, [[Social work|social services]], and [[health care]] to ensure that these factors did not affect the outcomes of the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm Ramey &amp; Campbell, 1991] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712144221/http://www.childtrends.org/Lifecourse/programs/CarolinaAbecedarianProgram.htm |date=July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the 111 infants were identified as "high risk" based on maternal education (which was on average 10th grade), family income, and other factors. The teacher-child ratio was low. It ranged from 1:3 for infants to 1:6 at age 5.&lt;ref name=Kaufman2009&gt;IQ Testing 101, Alan S. Kaufman, 2009, Springer Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-8261-0629-3}} {{ISBN|9780826106292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant findings==
Follow-up assessment of the participants involved in the project has been ongoing.  So far, outcomes have been  measured at ages 3, 4, 5, 6.5, 8, 12, 15, 21, and 30.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Pungello, Miller-Johnson, Burchinal, &amp; Ramey, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The areas covered were [[Cognition|cognitive functioning]], academic skills, [[educational attainment]], [[employment]], [[parenting|parenthood]], and social adjustment. The significant findings of the experiment were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061024015049/http://www.fpg.unc.edu/~abc/summary.cfm The Carolina Abecedarian Project], 2006-10-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/wordpress/?page_id=70 evidencebasedprograms.org - Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy: Social Programs that work: Abecedarian Project], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Impact of child care/preschool on reading and math achievement, and cognitive ability, at age 21:

* An increase of 1.8 grade levels in reading achievement
* An increase of 1.3 grade levels in math achievement
* A modest increase in Full-Scale IQ (4.4 points), and in Verbal IQ (4.2 points).

Impact of child care/preschool on life outcomes at age 21:

* Completion of a half-year more of education
* Much higher percentage enrolled in school at age 21 (42 percent vs. 20 percent)
* Much higher percentage attended, or still attending, a 4-year college (36 percent vs. 14 percent)
* Much higher percentage engaged in skilled jobs (47 percent vs. 27 percent)
* Much lower percentage of teen-aged parents (26 percent vs. 45 percent)
* Reduction of criminal activity

Statistically significant outcomes  at age 30:

*Four times more likely to have graduated from a four-year college (23 percent vs. 6 percent)
*More likely to have been employed consistently over the previous two years (74 percent vs. 53 percent)
*Five times less likely to have used public assistance in the previous seven years (4 percent vs. 20 percent)
*Delayed becoming parents by average of almost two years

(Most recent information from Developmental Psychology, January 18, 2012, cited in uncnews.unc.edu, January 19, 2012)

The project concluded that high quality, educational child care from early infancy was therefore of utmost importance.

Other, less intensive programs, notably the [[Head Start Program]], but also others, have not been as successful. It may be that they provided too little too late compared with the Abecedarian program.&lt;ref name=Kaufman2009/&gt;

==Cost==

The total per-child cost of the project was ~$67,225, or ~$13,900 for each of the five years (2002 dollars); Masse &amp; Barnett 2002 estimated that the total annual cost of a comparable program for all poor children in 2002 would have been ~$3 billion.

==Criticisms==

Some researchers have advised caution about the reported positive results of the project. Among other things, they have pointed out analytical discrepancies in published reports, including unexplained changes in sample sizes between different assessments and publications. [[Herman Spitz]] has noted that a mean cognitive ability difference of similar magnitude to the final difference between the intervention and control groups was apparent in cognitive tests already at age six months, indicating that "4 1/2 years of massive intervention ended with virtually no effect." Spitz has suggested that the IQ difference between the intervention and control groups may have been latently present from the outset due to faulty randomization.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, A.A., &amp; Bacharach, V.R. (2000). [http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Bacharach_V_2000_Early_Generic_Educational_Intervention.pdf Early Generic Educational Intervention Has No Enduring Effect On Intelligence and Does Not Prevent Mental Retardation: The Infant Health and Development Program.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301175655/http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Bacharach_V_2000_Early_Generic_Educational_Intervention.pdf |date=March 1, 2014 }} ''Intelligence, 28,'' 161–192.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is known that randomization was compromised in the Abecedarian program, with seven families assigned to the experimental group and one family assigned to the control group dropping out of the program after learning about their random assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell F.A., &amp; Ramey C.T.

{{about|adjunct professors worldwide|the situation in the U.S. and Canada|Adjunct professors in North America}}

'''Adjunct professor''' ('''adjunct lecturer''' and '''adjunct instructor''', or '''adjunct faculty''' collectively) is a type of academic appointment in [[higher education]]. 

* In the [[Academic ranks in the United States|United States]], an adjunct is a non-[[Academic tenure|tenure-track]] faculty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/teaching-careers/adjunct-professor/|title=What is an Adjunct Professor? Job Description &amp; Salary|date=1 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/adjunct-professor-earn-less-than-pet-sitter|title=I am an adjunct professor who teaches five classes. I earn less than a pet-sitter - Lee Hall|first=Lee|last=Hall|date=22 June 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it can also be a scholar or teacher whose primary employer is not the school or department with which they have adjunct status. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/handbook/appointments-and-promotions/classification-of-ranks-and-titles|title=Classification of Ranks and Titles »  Faculty Handbook  - Boston University|website=www.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Academic ranks in Australia|Australia]], the term ''adjunct'' is reserved for academics and researchers from outside the university who have a close association with the university, e.g. through supervision of PhD students, recognised by an honorary title reflective of their rank and standing (Adjunct Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Associate Professor or Professor). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hr.uwa.edu.au/policies/policies/titles/adjunct-and-clinical-titles|title=Adjunct and clinical titles|first=The University of Western|last=Australia,|website=www.hr.uwa.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/5.20.15-honorary-and-adjunct-title-holders|title=Policies and Procedures Library -  The University of Queensland, Australia|website=ppl.app.uq.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jcu.edu.au/policy/hr-staff-development/adjunct-appointments|title=Adjunct Appointments|website=www.jcu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://policies.scu.edu.au/view.current.php?id=00027|title=SCU Policy Library - Adjunct, Visiting and Conjoint Appointments Policy|first=(TWEEK!)|last=www.tweek.com.au|website=policies.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Canada, adjunct professors are often nominated in recognition of active involvement with the appointing institution, while they are employed by government, industry, a profession or another institution &lt;ref&gt;https://www.unb.ca/gradstudies/_assets/pdfs/policyprocedure-adjunctprofessor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The position Course Lecturer, rather than adjunct, is used if the appointment is strictly to teach one or more courses, contrasting with US usage of the title for all instructors.
* In [[Portugal]] the designation ''Professor Adjunto'' imply a stable full-time employment in a Polytechnic University.
* In countries such as [[Academic ranks in Argentina|Argentina]] and [[Academic ranks in Brazil|Brazil]], a similar designation, ''Professor adjunto'', does imply stable full-time employment.
* In parts of [[Academic ranks in Spain|Spain]], ''Profesor Adjunto'' is a non-tenured position.
* In [[Academic ranks in Hungary|Hungary]], there exists a similar term ''Adjunktus'', as well as ''Adiunkt'' in [[List of academic ranks#Poland|Poland]].
* In [[Academic ranks in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], private universities follow the title Adjunct Professor/Adjunct Associate Professor to imply non-tenure faculty members.
* In [[Academic ranks in Thailand|Thailand]], Adjunct (Assistant/Associate) Professors are considered "non-regular officers".
* In [[List of academic ranks#Pakistan|Pakistan]], Adjunct (Assistant/Associate) Professors are also considered as non-regular faculty members and usually posts are given to Pakistani overseas scientists under Faculty Development Program.
* In [[Finland]], the Docents' Union of Finland and the Finnish Ministry of Education recommend the term Adjunct Professor in English as a translation of the title of [[Docent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/suomendosenttiliitto|title=Suomen Dosenttiliitto|website=www.helsinki.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A docentship should be regarded as an educational title not connected with the employment pyramid as such, rather an assurance of the level of expertise, to enable the person to advance further in his/her academic career. The rank of a docent entitles scientists to be principal investigators, lead research groups and act as the supervisors of doctoral students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5984">An '''adult learner''' (North America) or '''mature student''' (UK) (sometimes also called '''adult student''', '''returning adult''', and '''adult returner)''' is a person who is 25 years and up who is involved in forms of learning. Adult learners fall in a specific criteria of being experienced, and do not have the high school diploma. Many of the adult learners go back to school to finish a degree, or earn a new one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2002/analyses/nontraditional/sa01.asp Special Analysis 2002 - Nontraditional Undergraduates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416180603/http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2002/analyses/nontraditional/sa01.asp |date=April 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malcolm Knowles]]'s work distinguished adult learners as distinct from adolescent and child learners in his principle of [[andragogy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He established 5 assumptions about the adult learner. This included self-concept, adult learner experience, readiness to learn, orientation to learning, and motivation to learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criteria==
In the US, adult learners fall into the category of [[nontraditional student]]s, whom the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] defines as meeting at least one of the following seven criteria:
* Delays enrollment (does not enter post secondary education in the same calendar year that he or she finished high school).
* Attends part time for at least part of the academic year.
* Works full time (35 hours or more per week) while enrolled.
* Is considered financially independent for purposes of determining eligibility for financial aid.
* Has dependents other than a spouse (usually children, but sometimes others).
* Is a single parent (either not married or married but separated and has dependents).
* Does not have a high school diploma (completed high school with a GED or other high school completion certificate or did not finish high school).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Not all nontraditional students are adult learners, as the term refers to the brain development of the person, but adult learners are considered nontraditional students. This can be due to the wide range of cultural, job, and educational backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sreb.org/general-information/who-adult-learner|title=Who is the Adult Learner? - Southern Regional Education Board|website=www.sreb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, a student is normally classified as a mature student if he or she is an (undergraduate) student who is at least 25+ years old at the start of his or her course, or in the Irish case on the first of January of the year of entry, and usually having been away from school for at least two years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The normal entry requirements for school-leavers wishing to start an undergraduate degree are often not applied to mature students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{citation needed|date = March 2011}}

==In higher education==

Adult students are frequently referred to as [[Non-traditional student|nontraditional students]] in higher education. Adult students are contrasted with [[traditional students]], who are typically aged 18–22, attend full-time, live on campus, do not work, and have few, if any, family responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pascarella|first1=Ernest T.|last2=Terenzini|first2=Patrick T|title=Studying College Students in the 21st Century: Meeting New Challenges|journal=The Review of Higher Education|date=Winter 1998|volume=21|issue=2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 36 percent of postsecondary students were age 25 or older and 47 percent were independent students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =2010-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special characteristics==
As opposed to a child or adolescent, adult learners typically have more life experience and their brains are more fully developed. When confronted with new knowledge or an experience, adult learners construe new meaning based on their life experiences and their more developed brains process these experiences differently than someone with a less developed brain (children and adolescents).&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;[[Sharan Merriam|Merriam, S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1654">An '''animated narrative vignette''' (ANV) is an [[instructional technology]] used to motivate and facilitate role-playing, [[problem solving]], and discussion. Teachers develop the ANVs to present in class or in online training. Students might also create them in [[experiential learning]] exercises. They provide computer animation representations of teachable situations that encourage critical thinking and may also provide an instrument for assessing attitudes and behaviors. Vignettes have been used to teach mathematics and science, management skills, problem solving, and character education.

An '''assessment center''' is a process where candidates are examined to determine their suitability for specific types of employment, especially [[management]] or military command.  The candidates' [[personality psychology|personality]] and [[aptitude]]s are determined by techniques including [[interview]]s, group exercises, presentations, [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s and [[psychometric testing]].

==History==
An early example of assessment is the story of [[Gideon]] selecting the most suitable Israelite warriors:&lt;ref name=Prep&gt;{{citation |title=A Preparation Guide for the Assessment Center Method |author=Tina Lewis Rowe |publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher |year=2013 |isbn=9780398087524 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Then the Lord said to Gideon, “The people are still too many; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.”  So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, “You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink.”  Now the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the rest of the people kneeled to drink water.  The Lord said to Gideon, "I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and will give the Midianites into your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home."|{{bibleref2|Judges|7:4–7|NASB}}}}

In modern times, the [[German army]] introduced assessment techniques for selecting its officers in the 1930s.  Psychologist [[:de:Max Simoneit|Max Simoneit]] was appointed to head the army's laboratory and introduced leadership tests.  These were terminated in 1941 after too many favoured candidates had failed them.&lt;ref name=Prep/&gt;

Assessment centres were created in [[World War II]] to select [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s and are still commonly used in military recruitment today.  Examples include the [[Admiralty Interview Board]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Army Officer Selection Board|War Office Selection Board]] of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wWyrlcyQLyUC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Assessment and development centres |author=Iain Ballantyne, Nigel Povah |chapter=What is an Assessment Centre? |publisher=Gower Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After World War 2, The OSS type of assessment center was essentially abandoned in The United States except for some internal use in intelligence gathering operations by the CIA. The British Civil Service Selection Board and Australians identified participants still used it for selection on their military college. Also, south Africans used the technique to identify supervisors in gold mines.
 
Assessment centers specifically applied for industrial usage can be traced back to the early 1950s and the pioneering work of Robert K Greenleaf and Douglas W. Bray of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). Douglas W. Bray as a director of human resources at AT&amp;T, directed a study that lasted over 20 years and followed the careers of young business managers as they progressed up the telephone company rankings. This study showed that the assessment center method could successfully predict organizational achievement and was later implemented throughout  AT&amp;T and later on adopted by many other companies: IBM, Standard Oil (Ohio) and Sears for example.

In 1975, the first guidelines on the use of assessment centers was created as a statement of the considerations believed to be most important for all users of the assessment center method. The guidelines ensure the integrity of the process, the validity of the data, qualifications of assessors, and the rights of the participants. The guidelines have since been revised several times to reflect current legality issues, global insights, and technological advances in the field. The most current version of the Guidelines and Ethical Considerations for Assessment Center Operations was endorsed by the 38th International Congress on Assessment Methods in Alexandria, Virginia in October 2014.
Today, The ACM is used by organizations all over the world in both private and public sectors to better select of employees and identifying their development in different areas. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.assessmentcenters.org/Assessmentcenters/media/2014/2014-Final-Presentations/International-AC-Guidelines-6th-Edition-2014.pdf|title=History of guidelines |author=Deborah E. Rupp, Brian J. Hoffman |chapter=History |publisher=Education and Praeger Publishers |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AT&amp;T]] created a building for recruitment of staff in the 1950s.  This was called '''The Assessment Centre''' and was influential on subsequent [[personnel]] methods in other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1JohpKEWvnYC&amp;pg=PT6 |title=Managing Assessment Centres |author=John Sponton, Stewart Wright | chapter=What is an assessment centre? |publisher=Pocketbooks |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-906610-05-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies use this method to recruit for their graduate programmes by assessing the personality and intellect of potential employees who have recently graduated from university and have nil or limited work history. The [[Big Four (audit firms)|big four accountancy firms]] conduct assessment centre days to recruit their trainees. 68% of employers in the UK and USA now use some form of assessment centre as part of their recruitment/promotion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assessmentcentrehq.com|title=Assessment Centre HQ|work=Assessment Centre HQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years companies have been set up to support assessment centre coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.graduateassessment.co.uk/index.html |title=Graduate Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.assessmentcentrehq.com/assessment-centre-overview/ |title=What to expect at your assessment centre: A step-by-step guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Assessment center is not just a building for assessing a job candidate. it is a process of evaluation of behaviour based on multiple evaluation including: job related simulations, interviews and/or psychological test 

The ultimate reason for having an assessment centre in any organization is to gather all relevant information under a standardized conditions about an individual’s capabilities to perform a given task. Assessment centers are often the method of choice for selecting senior leaders in government and municipal jobs, including police chief and fire captains.

During the process of assessing candidates, series of exercises that are designed to simulate the condition of a given job are given to the candidate to do. This help the assessor to determined if the candidate possesses the necessary skill and behaviour needed for the job.

The assessment center method provides a sort of wide-ranging, multidimensional assessment that has a strong record of both research significance and practical effectiveness to be accepted by participants and decision-makers alike. 
In essence, the purpose of assessment centre is to examine the skills and psychological state of an individual in order to determine his or her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hr.guide.com/data/g318.htm |title=Purpose of the assessment centres |author=hrmaster|chapter=Purpose|publisher=hr-guide.com|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seneka Starszy Sevilla cropped.JPG|thumb|right|[[Seneca the Elder]] compiled a study of the classic themes in his ten volumes of ''Controversiæ''.]]
A '''''controversia''''' is an exercise in [[rhetoric]]; a form of [[declamation]] in which the student speaks for one side in a notional legal case such as treason or poisoning.  The facts of the matter and relevant law are presented in a persuasive manner, in the style of a legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=500–501 |title=Handbook of Literary Rhetoric |author=Heinrich Lausberg, translated by David E. Orton |publisher=BRILL |year=1998 |isbn=9789004107052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exercise was used in [[ancient Rome]], where it was, with the ''[[suasoria]]'', the final stage of a course in rhetoric at an [[academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Declamation and contestation in satire |author=Susanna Morton Braund |page=148 |title = Roman Eloquence: Rhetoric in Society and Literature |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=9780415125444}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''controversia'' is distinguished from this rhetorical practice because of the complexity of its structural system of argument and the greater range of situations and characters employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric, Volume 1|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780195125955|location=Oxford|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction can also be explained in the way students who focused on this exercise end up as forensic [[Public speaking|orators]] while those who trained in ''suasoria'' followed a career in [[deliberative rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philo and Paul Among the Sophists|last=Winter|first=Bruce|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521591082|location=Cambridge|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Seneca the Elder]] was an expert rhetorician and, from memory, compiled a set of classical themes for this exercise: the ''Controversiæ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=276 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome|volume=1 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9780195170726}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Controversia'' is demonstrated in the case of [[Quintilian|Quintillian]]'s ''Declamationes Minores'' where ''suasoria'' was turned into this exercise by using a courtroom as a setting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Roman Rhetoric|last=Dominik|first=William|last2=Hall|first2=Jon|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons|year=2010|isbn=9781405120913|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot addressed the issue of a son who married the daughter of his father's enemy so he could use the [[dowry]] to ransom his who was captured by pirates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Curriculum Theory''' ('''CT''') is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] devoted to examining and shaping educational [[curriculum|curricula]]. There are many interpretations of CT, being as narrow as the dynamics of the [[Learning|learning process]] of one child in a [[classroom]] to the [[lifelong learning]] path an individual takes. CT can be approached from the [[education]]al, [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Sociology|sociological]] perspectives. James MacDonald states "one central concern of theorists is identifying the fundamental unit of curriculum with which to build conceptual systems. Whether this be [[Rationality|rational decisions]], action processes, language [[pattern]]s, or any other [[potential]] unit has not been agreed upon by the [[Theory|theorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. MacDonald (1971). Curriculum Theory. The Journal of Educational Research, 64, 5, 195-200.&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum theory is fundamentally concerned with [[Value (ethics)|values]],&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Kliebard (1989). Problems of Definition of Curriculum. Journal of Curriculum and Supervision, 5, 1, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Historiography|historical analysis]] of curriculum, ways of viewing current educational curriculum and policy decisions, and theorizing about the curricula of the future.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Wallin (2011). What is ?Curriculum Theorizing: for a People Yet to Come. Stud Philos Educ, 30, 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pinar defines the contemporary field of curriculum theory as "the effort to understand curriculum as a [[Symbolics|symbolic]] representation".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the word "curriculum" in [[university]] records was in 1582, at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]], [[Holland]]: "having completed the curriculum of his studies".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1989) in W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, curriculum theory as a [[Discipline (academia)|field of study]] is thought to have been initiated with the publication of The [[Yale University|Yale]] Report on the Defense of the Classics in 1828, which promoted the study of a classical curriculum, including [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], by rote [[memorization]].&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faculty psychology ==
The school of [[faculty psychology]], dominating the field from 1860-1890 in the [[United States]], believed that the [[brain]] was a [[muscle]] that could be improved by the exercise of [[memorization]] (with [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] a secondary consideration).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Curriculum: An Introduction to the Study of Historical and Contemporary Curriculum Discourses|last=Pinar|first=William|last2=Reynolds|first2=William|last3=Slattery|first3=Patrick|last4=Taubman|first4=Peter|publisher=Peter Lang|year=1995|isbn=9780820426013|location=New York|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the classical theory, which previously emphasized a method of teaching school subjects using memorization and recitation as primary instructional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curriculum Development in the Postmodern Era|last=Slattery|first=Patrick|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|year=2006|isbn=9780415953375|location=New York|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory itself claims three constituent faculties or power:

* the presence of [[Volition (psychology)|will]] or volition, which enables  human beings to act;
* the [[Emotion|emotions]], which pertains to the affections and passions that enable human beings to experience pleasure, pain, love, and hate; and,
* the [[intellect]] or understanding, which is the foundation of human [[rationality]] that enables him to make judgments and comprehend meanings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Education and Human Development|last=Farenga|first=Stephen|last2=Ness|first2=Daniel|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780765612687|location=Oxon|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that education should expand the faculty of the mind and this is achieved through the key concepts of discipline and furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The faculty theory, which steered curriculum policy for [[Elementary school|elementary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]], and high schools, was institutionalized by three committees appointed by the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) in the 1890s to follow faculty [[psychology]] principles:&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee of Ten]] on Secondary School Studies (1893), the [[Committee of Fifteen]] on Elementary Education (1895) and the Committee on College Entrance Requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== The Herbartians ==
Different schools of Curriculum Theory developed as a reaction to the [[classicism]] of [[faculty psychology]], including the Herbartians, who organized the Herbart Club in 1892, and later the National Herbart Society (1895-1899). Their philosophy was based on the thoughts of Johann Frederich Herbart, a German [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and [[Teacher|educator]], who believed that "the mere memorizing of isolated facts, which had characterized school instruction for ages, had little value of either educational or moral ends".
&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The social efficiency movement ==
The publication of [[John Franklin Bobbitt|John Bobbitt]]'s The Curricula in 1918 took the prevalent industrial revolutionary concepts of [[Experiment|experimental science]] and [[Social welfare function|social efficiency]] and applied them to the classroom. He believed that "curriculum must directly and specifically prepare students for tasks in the [[Adult World|adult world]]".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that "[[Life expectancy|human life]]...consists in the performance of specific activities. Education that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and adequately for these specific activities." &lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. K. (1996, 2000) ‘Curriculum theory and practice' the encyclopaedia of informal education, www.infed.org/biblio/b-curric.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; From this idea, he suggested that curriculum was a series of experiences that children have in order to meet "[[Strategic planning|objectives]]," or abilities and habits that people need for particular activities.

Other famous theorists of this movement included [[Edward Thorndike|Edward L. Thorndyke]] (1874-1949), the father of experimental psychology in education, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856-1915), with his theory of scientific management, [[David Snedden]], an educational sociologist who promoted social efficiency and vocational education, and W.W. Charters (1875-1952), a teacher educator who felt that "curriculum was {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} those methods by which objectives are determined".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; By using education as an efficiency tool, these [[Theory|theorists]] believed that society could be controlled. Students were scientifically evaluated by testing (such as [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]]), and educated towards their predicted role in society. This involved the introduction of [[Vocational education|vocational]] and junior high schools to address the curriculum designed around specific life activities that correlated with each student's determined [[Society|societal]] future. The socially efficient curriculum consisted of minute parts or tasks that together formed a bigger concept.

== The progressive reform movement ==
The progressive reform movement began in the late 1870s with the work of Colonel Francis Parker, but is most identified with [[John Dewey]], and also John Mayer Rice and [[Lester Frank Ward]]. Dewey's 1899 book [[The School and Society]] is often credited with starting the movement.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 90-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These reformers felt that curriculum should be child driven and at the child's present capacity level. To aid in understanding the relationship of curriculum and child, Dewey described curriculum as, "a map, a summary, an arranged and orderly view of previous experiences, serves as a guide to future experience; it gives direction; it facilitates control; it economizes effort, preventing useless wandering, and pointing out the paths which lead most quickly and most certainly to a desired result". He envisioned "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process".&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1902). The Child and the Curriculum (pp. 1-31). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Efficiency and Progressive Reform movements were rivals throughout the 1920s in the United States, with the 1930s belonging to the Progressives, or a curriculum combining aspects of both.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 116-142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph W. Tyler]]'s Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction (1949) swung the pendulum of curriculum theory away from child centeredness toward more generalized behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 148-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler's theory was based on four fundamental questions which became known as the ''Tyler Rationale'':
# What educational purposes should the school seek to attain?
# What educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes?
# How can these educational experiences be effectively [[Organization|organized]]?
# How can we determine whether these purposes are being attained?

== The multicultural education movement ==

There is a racial crisis in [[United States|America]], which is exacerbated by the widening gap between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. A. (1995). Multicultural education and curriculum transformation. The Journal of Negro Education, 64(4), 390–400&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address this gap within the [[multicultural education]] movement there is a [[body of knowledge]] which argues for the need to reconceptualise, re-envision, and rethink American schooling.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Banks, C. A., &amp; Banks, J. A. (1995). Equity pedagogy: An essential component of multicultural education. Theory into Practice, 34(3), 152–158&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[author]]s advocate the need for fundamental changes in the [[Education|educational system]] which acknowledges that there is a plurality within teaching and learning for students of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2002). Preparing for culturally responsive teaching. JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION-WASHINGTON DC-, 53(2), 106–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, A., &amp; Hardaker, G. (2013).

Pedagogy of the oppressed. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; of diversity and is an obstacle to integration into society and student achievement. Current multicultural education theory suggests that curriculum and institutional change is required to support the development of students from diverse [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[Culture|cultural]] backgrounds. This is a controversial view &lt;ref&gt;d'Souza, D. (1991). Illiberal education: The politics of race and sex on campus. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; but multicultural education argues &lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. A. (1995). Multicultural education and curriculum transformation.

ERIC.&lt;/ref&gt; supports this concern for students who do not belong to the dominant group and seem to have challenging curriculum experiences that conflict with their personal cultural identity and their wider community reference groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, A., &amp; Hardaker, G. (2013). The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools. Teaching in Higher Education, 1–13. doi:10.1080/13562517.2012.725221. http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/15029/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sputnik and the National Defense Act ==
The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] in 1957 created a focus on science and math  in the United States curriculum. [[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Hyman Rickover]] accused the American public of indifference to intellectual achievement. "Our schools must return to the tradition of formal education in [[Western culture|Western civilization]]-transmission of [[cultural heritage]], and preparation for life through rigorous intellectual training of young minds to think clearly, logically, and independently".&lt;ref&gt;H. Rickover (1959) in W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a return to curricula similar to the classicists of the 1890s and the modern birth of the traditionalists, with massive federal funding for curriculum development provided by the National Defense Act of 1958.

== Reconceptualized curriculum ==
Joseph J. Schwab was instrumental in provoking curriculum developers to think beyond the traditionalist approach. In his 1969 paper "The Practical: A Language for Curriculum" he declared the curriculum field "moribund".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; This, plus the social unrest of the 1960s and '70s stirred a new movement of "reconceptualization" of curricula. A group of theorists, including James Macdonald, [[Dwayne Huebner]], Ross Mooney, Herbert M. Kliebard, Paul Klohr, Michael Apple, W.F. Pinar, and others, created ways of thinking about curriculum and its role in the [[academy]], in [[school]]s, and in [[society]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kliebard (2004). The Struggle for the American Curriculum,1893-1958. New York, NY: RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach included perspectives from the [[social]], [[Race (human categorization)|racial]], [[gender]], [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]], [[Politics|political]], [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] and [[Theology|theological]] points of view.

== &lt;font color="#777777"&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;oday ==
W.F. Pinar describes the present field "balkanized...divided into relatively separate fiefdoms or sectors of scholarship, each usually ignoring the other except for occasional criticism."&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The top-down governmental control of educational curriculum in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world, including the United States, has been criticized as being "ahistorical and atheoretical, and as a result prone to difficult problems in its implementation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Priestley (2011). Whatever happened to curriculum theory? Critical realism and curriculum change. Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society, 19, 2, 221-237.&lt;/ref&gt; But there are theorists who are looking beyond curriculum as "simply as a collection of study plans, syllabi, and teaching subjects. Instead, the curriculum becomes the outcome of a process reflecting a political and societal agreement about the what, why, and how of education for the desired society of the future."&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Tedesco, R. Opertii, and M. Amadio (2014). The curriculum debate: Why it is important today. Prospects, 44, 527-546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diploma Supplement''' is a document accompanying a [[Europe|European]] higher education diploma, providing a standardised description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies completed by its holder.

==Overview==
The Diploma Supplement is designed to provide a description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies that were successfully completed by the individual named on the original qualification to which the supplement is appended. It should be free from any [[value-judgement]]s, equivalence statements or suggestions about recognition. The Diploma Supplement provides a common structure to translate qualifications across the EU. It is a flexible, non-prescriptive tool which has been shown to save time, money and workload by an EU [[working party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.lv/ENIC/ds/wpreport.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Diploma Supplements were gradually implemented at European universities as part of the Bologna Process, since approximately 1999. Students graduating from European Universities since this date, and depending on what year the country in which their university is located became signatory to his Process, typically will have received a Diploma Supplement. However, even as late as 2013 there were still some European universities, who despite their country's years-old membership of the Bologna Process, had not yet finished the necessary procedures for issuing Diploma Supplements to their graduates. 

It is important for countries and educational institutions located outside of the European Higher Education Area to realize that Diploma Supplements cannot be retroactively issued, hence why students who graduated before their institution's country became signatory to the Bologna Convention cannot possibly have a diploma supplement for that degree. Consequently, requesting a Diploma Supplement from a student who graduated from a European university in 1995 or earlier is nonsensical since the Bologna Process was not even in place before that date.

'''Direct instruction''' ('''DI''') is a general term for the explicit teaching of a skill-set using [[lecture]]s or demonstrations of the material to students. A particular subset of '''direct instruction''', denoted by capitalization as '''Direct Instruction''', refers to a specific example of the approach developed by [[Siegfried Engelmann]] and Wesley C. Becker. DI teaches by explicit instruction,&lt;ref name=LearnLab&gt;[http://www.learnlab.org/research/wiki/index.php/Explicit_instruction] Explicit Instruction. LearnLab. Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Retrieved 2017-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to exploratory models such as [[inquiry-based learning]]. DI includes [[tutorial]]s, participatory laboratory classes, [[discussion]], [[recitation]], [[seminar]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[observation]], [[active learning]], [[practicum|practica]], or [[internship]]s.

DI relies on a systematic curriculum design, delivered by implementation of a prescribed [[behavioral script]]. On the premise that all students can learn and all teachers successfully teach if given effective training in specific techniques, teachers may be evaluated based on measurable student learning.

In some special education programs, direct instruction is used in [[resource rooms]], when teachers assist with [[homework]] completion and academic remediation.&lt;ref name=Englert &gt;[http://rse.sagepub.com/content/5/2/38.abstract Effective direct instruction practices in special education settings]. Englert, Carol S. ''Remedial &amp; Special Education'', Vol 5(2), Mar-Apr 1984, 38-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engelmann's Direct Instruction method and DISTAR ==

The term ''Direct Instruction'' applies specifically to a pedagogical model developed by Siegfried Engelmann in 1964 at the University of Illinois Institute for Research on Exceptional Children.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. (2007) Teaching Needy Kids in our Backward System.Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[DISTAR]] was a specific direct instruction model developed by Siegfried Engelmann and Wesley C. Becker. Engelmann and Becker sought to identify teaching methods that would accelerate the progress of historically disadvantaged elementary school students.&lt;ref&gt;Englemann, S.E.(1968). Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching. ''Journal of School Psychology, 6,'' 89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim &gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26452612_Direct_Instruction_An_Educators'_Guide_and_a_Plea_for_Action Direct Instruction: An Educators’ Guide and a Plea for Action]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 6.(2),'' Page 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DISTAR]], an acronym for '''D'''irect '''I'''nstruction '''S'''ystem for '''T'''eaching '''A'''rithmetic and '''R'''eading, gained prominence during [[Project Follow Through]], the largest educational study ever conducted in America.

Features of DI include:
*Explicit instruction based on lesson plans, often with specific teacher "scripts."
*[[Ability grouping]]. Students are grouped based on their rate of progress through the program.
*Emphasis on pace and efficiency of instruction. Lessons are designed to bring students to mastery as quickly as possible.
*Frequent assessment.
*Embedded professional development/coaching. Program developers recommend careful monitoring and coaching.

Direct Instruction has been effectively delivered through peers to students with [[learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella &gt;Marchand-Martella, &amp; Martella (2002) [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/2/213.pdf&amp;productCode=pa An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (2),'' 214 -235&lt;/ref&gt;
Peer delivery offers teachers new ways to use the curriculum.&lt;ref name=Marchand-Martella /&gt; The approach has also been examined as a model to assist students in a [[resource room]] with homework completion, bolster executive functioning skills and improve teacher efficiency.&lt;ref name=Englert /&gt;

==Success for All==
Another popular direct instruction approach is the [[Success for All]] program, which uses [[scripted teaching]] to instruct elementary children in [[phonics]] intensive reading instruction program. What the teacher says is carefully scripted in the program. The program was designed by [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor [[Robert Slavin]] in the mid 1980s for failing schools in [[Baltimore]]. The program requires a dedicated 90 minutes of reading instruction each day in which the teacher must follow a pre-ordained lesson plan that has every minute filled with scripted instruction and specific activities designed to teach reading. [[Jonathan Kozol|Kozol]] criticized the program in his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]]'', for being excessively dogmatic, utilitarian, and authoritarian.&lt;ref name=Kozol &gt;{{cite book |last=Kozol |first=Jonathan |date=2005 |title=The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America |url= |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page= |isbn=1-4000-5244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Debates about the efficacy of DI have raged since before the final results of [[Project Follow Through]] were published; however, there is substantial empirical research supporting its effectiveness. A meta-analysis published by Adams &amp; Engelmann (1996), a chief architect of the DI program, finds a "mean effect size average per study...(as) more than .75, which confirms that the overall effect is substantial."

In some special education programs, it is used in a [[resource room]] with small groups of students. Some research has shown benefit with this model.&lt;ref&gt;Resource Room Teachers' use of Strategies that Promote the Success of Handicapped Students in Regular Classrooms Nancy K. Glomb and Daniel P. Morgan Journal of Special Education, Jan 1991; vol. 25: pp. 221 - 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct Instruction is used with students from every population segment (with regard to poverty, culture, and race). In [[Project Follow Through]], the DI model was ranked first in achievement for poor students, students who were not poor, urban students, rural students, [[African American]] students, [[Hispanic]] students, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students.  Today, many of the Bureau of Indian Affair's highest-performing schools use Direct Instruction materials. The Baltimore Curriculum Project has many schools with Free and Reduced Lunch Rates above 75% serving student populations that are more than 90% African American. These schools have shown strong achievement gains using Direct Instruction.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007&gt;Rebar, M. (2007).  [http://www.ewu.edu/getset/Academic_Acceleration_G1_TR_2007-1.pdf Academic acceleration in first grade using the Direct Instruction model]. (Report No. 2007-1). Cheney, WA: Eastern Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analysis of 85 [[single-subject design]] studies comparing direct instruction to other teaching strategies found the effects to be substantial for students with learning disabilities;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, H.L. &amp; Sachse-Lee, C. (2000). A Meta-Analysis of Single-Subject-Design Intervention Research for Students with LD. ''Journal of Learning Disabilities,'' Vol. 33, No. 2, 114-136 {{doi|10.1177/002221940003300201}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, when qualified by IQ and reading levels [[strategy instruction]] (SI) had better effects for the high IQ group. For the low-IQ discrepancy groups, higher effect sizes were yielded for a Combined DI and SI Model when compared to all competing models. With the exception of handwriting, DI's effects were all above .8 (i.e., reading and mathematics).{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

John Hattie's Visible Learning: A Synthesis of Over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement (2009) summarizes the results of four meta-analyses that examined Direct Instruction. These analyses incorporated 304 studies of over 42,000 students. Across all of these students, the average effect size was .59 and was significantly larger than those of any other curriculum Hattie studied.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}

Direct Instruction is recognized as one of two effective models of comprehensive school reform and, in many cases, can be integrated into a tiered model system{{Definition needed|date=May 2016}} to address students with developing problems.&lt;ref name=Stewart &gt;Stewart, R.M.,  Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp;  Benner, G.J. (2005). [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ846760.pdf Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior]. ''JEIBI''  2 (3), 115-123&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from [[Project Follow Through]], conducted in a variety of selected communities throughout the United States, suggested that Direct Instruction is the most effective model for teaching academic skills and for affective outcomes (e.g., [[self-esteem]]) of children. Recent large-scale studies (1997–2003), such as the Baltimore Curriculum Project, show that it is possible to help schools that are in the lowest twenty percent with respect to academic achievement steadily improve until they are performing well above average. In some cases, school achievement improved from the 16th percentile to above the 90th percentile.&lt;ref name=Rebar2007/&gt;

==Criticism==
One three-year study of methods of teaching reading showed that highly scripted, teacher-directed methods of teaching reading were not as effective as traditional methods that allowed a more flexible approach.&lt;ref name=Ryder2006&gt;Ryder RJ, Burton JL, Silberg A. 2006. Longitudinal study of direct instruction effects from first through third grade. Journal of Educational Research, 99, 3, 179-191&lt;/ref&gt; Urban teachers in particular expressed great concern over the DI's lack of sensitivity to issues of [[poverty]], [[culture]], and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]].&lt;ref name=Ryder2006/&gt;

The former president of the [[National Science Teachers Association]] (NSTA), Anne Tweed, questioned whether direct instruction was the most effective science teaching strategy. In the December 15, 2004 NSTA Reports she concluded that "direct instruction alone cannot replace the in-depth experience with science concepts that inquiry-based strategies provide."&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, a. (2004). [http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=50045 Direct Instruction: Is It the Most Effective Science Teaching Strategy?] ''NSTA Reports'', 15 December 2004. Retrieved 5 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics also see DI as a betrayal of the [[humanism|humanistic]], [[egalitarian]] foundations of public education, or as a "canned" or "teacher proof" curriculum deliverable via unskilled teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-distance.syr.edu/sdlhuman.html From behaviorism to humanism: Incorporating self-direction in learning concepts into the instructional design process.] In H. B. Long &amp; Associates, New ideas about self-directed learning. Norman, OK: Oklahoma Research Center for Continuing Professional and Higher Education, University of Oklahoma, 1994 (Roger Hiemstra &amp; Ralph Brockett)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, where DI has been used in schools among several remote Indigenous Australians communities in Queensland, DI has been criticised for its high cost in return for at best modest improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, as well as its US-centric theme which is alien to indigenous Australian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Misty Adoniou.

A further 135 students are enrolled at St Joseph’s College in [[Tabwiroa]] and 23 students at Steven Whitmee High School in [[Morikao]], making 370 secondary school students in total.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt; The two high schools at Morikao and Tabuiroa accommodate students from all over Kiribati who have passed the entrance examinations to get into the schools.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt;

St. Joseph's College was founded in 1939. Its alumni include both current President [[Anote Tong]], and previous incumbent [[Teburoro Tito]].

There are primary schools and secondary schools operated by the Christian denominations including the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (such as St. Joseph's College) and the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], (such as Moroni High School in [[South Tarawa]], of which [[Waitea Abiuta]] has been the headmaster).

Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend [[University of the South Pacific]], and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172788770.html Pacific Magazine: I-Kiribati Students Perform Well In Cuba], Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of the South Pacific has a campus in Kiribati for distant/flexible learning, but also to provide preparatory studies towards obtaining certificates, diplomas and degrees at other campus sites.

==Schools==
[[Kiribati Ministry of Education]] is the education ministry. Kiribati has 94 elementary schools, 24 junior high schools, and 16 senior high schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7403">'''"Effective Schools"''' is both an educational movement and body of research which examines school-based factors which positively influence learning outcomes in [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] schools.  Effective schools research has been widely adopted by school districts worldwide.

==History==
Early research into the essential qualities of successful schools emerged in North America as a response to the controversial 1966 [[James Samuel Coleman#Coleman Report|Coleman Report]], which concluded that family background and socio-economics were the major determinants of student achievement.  Research published by [[Christopher Jencks]] in 1972 contributed to Coleman's findings, suggesting that "school quality has little effect on achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Downer | first = Donovan F. | title = Review of Research on Effective Schools | publisher = McGill Journal of Education | date = Fall 1991 | url = http://mje.mcgill.ca/article/download/7995/5923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raptis"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Raptis | first1 = Helen | last2 = Fleming | first2 = Thomas | title = Reframing Education: How to Create Effective Schools | publisher = C.D. Howe Institute | date = Oct 2003 | url = http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/commentary_188.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coleman Report prompted U.S. policymakers to focus on "compensatory programs" which focused on changing the behavior of less advantaged students.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lezotte | first = Lawrence W. | title = Revolutionary and Evolutionary: The Effective Schools Movement | publisher = Effective School Products | year = 2001 | url = http://www.edutopia.org/pdfs/edutopia.org-closing-achievement-gap-lezotte-article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also stimulated vigorous reaction from educational researchers who believed, to the contrary, that schools ''could'' make a significant difference on student achievement.  Their research formed the foundation of the 'Effective Schools Movement', and enabled them to assert that "all children can learn and that the school controls the factors necessary to assure student mastery of the core curriculum."&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

Early effective schools researchers attempted to locate schools that were successful in educating students of all backgrounds, regardless of socio-economic status or family background.  Such schools were found in varying locations and communities, and researchers tried to isolate which philosophies, policies, and practices those schools had in common.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

[[Larry Lezotte]] and Wilbur B. Brookover conducted studies at eight Michigan elementary schools in the mid-1970s, identifying characteristics of schools that were improving or declining.  A notable finding was that "staff in the declining schools had low opinions of their students' abilities, while the staff in the improving schools had high opinions of student abilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Brookover | first1 = Wilbur B. | last2 = Lezotte | first2 = Lawrence W. | title = Changes in School Characteristics Coincident with Changes in Student Achievement | publisher = Michigan State University | year = 1977 | url = http://education.msu.edu/irt/PDFs/OccasionalPapers/op017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Weber, and later [[Ronald Edmonds]], conducted research in inner-city U.S. schools where students of low socio-economic background were able to equal or surpass the national average.  Edmonds' 1979 article "Effective Schools for the Urban Poor" is noted for drawing professional attention to the effective schools movement.  Edmonds outlined six characteristics essential to effective schools, including:
# Strong administrative leadership.
# High expectations.
# An orderly atmosphere.
# Basic skills acquisition as the school’s primary purpose.
# Capacity to divert school energy and resources from other activities to advance the school’s basic purpose.
# Frequent monitoring of pupil progress.

Educational researchers soon dropped "capacity to divert energy and resources" from the list, and Edmonds' “five-factor model” was widely proclaimed as a framework for reforming low-performing schools.&lt;ref name="Raptis"/&gt;

In 1979, ''Fifteen Thousand Hours'' documented effective schools research in high schools in the United Kingdom, and found that school characteristics could positively alter student achievement.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

Edmonds published "Programs of School Improvement: An Overview" in 1982, describing the "correlates of effective schools", a now widely used phrase commonly associated with the later work of Lezotte.  Edmonds' correlates described effective schools as the following:
# The leadership of the principal notable for substantial attention to the quality of instruction.
# A pervasive and broadly understood instructional focus.
# An orderly, safe climate conducive to teaching and learning.
# Teacher behaviors that convey the expectation that all students are expected to obtain at least minimum mastery.
# The use of measures of pupil achievement as the basis for program evaluation.&lt;ref name="Lezotte"/&gt;

In 1991, Lezotte published ''Correlates of Effective Schools: The First and Second Generation'', describing the "Seven Correlates of Effective Schools":
# Instructional leadership.
# Clear and focused mission.
# Safe and orderly environment.
# Climate of high expectations.
# Frequent monitoring of student progress.
# Positive home-school relations.
# Opportunity to learn and student time on task.

The correlates of effective schools have remained a cornerstone for many school districts.

==Current use==
The Council of Ontario Directors of Education describes Lezotte's seven correlates as "being necessary for ensuring high levels of student achievement", adding that educators should also consider the importance of home and an empathic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Effective Schools | publisher = Council of Ontario Directors of Education | date = June 30, 2011 | url = http://www.ontariodirectors.ca/CODE_Advisories/Downloads/CODE%20Advisory%20No%209%20WEB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] has broadened its description of effective schools to include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DCPS Effective Schools Framework | publisher = District of Columbia Public Schools | year = 2011 | url = http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/About+DCPS/Strategic+Documents/Effective+Schools+Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teaching and Learning.
# Leadership.
# Job-Embedded Professional Development.
# Resources.
# Safe and Effective Learning Environment.
# Family and Community Engagement.
# Data-Driven Decision Making.

==Implementation==
A key finding regarding the implementation of effective schools reforms is that the positive support the school principal is fundamental to success.  Also, teacher support for, belief in, and commitment to a particular reform tended to follow months or years of successful practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calman |first=Ruth C. |title=Exploring the Underlying Traits of High-Performing Schools |publisher=Education Quality and Accountability Office |date=Sep 2010 |url=http://www.eqao.com/Research/pdf/E/ExploringUnderlyingTraits_web.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704140010/http://www.eqao.com/Research/pdf/E/ExploringUnderlyingTraits_web.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Experiential learning''' is the process of [[learning]] through [[experience]], and is more specifically defined as "learning through reflection on doing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Improving Learning and Motivation|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1609604962|isbn=1609604962|last=Felicia|first=Patrick|year=2011|page=1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Hands-on learning''' is a form of experiential learning but does not necessarily involve students reflecting on their product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/blog/out-of-eden-experiential-learning-homa-tavangar ''The Out of Eden Walk: An Experiential Learning Journey from the Virtual to the Real,'' Edutopia, January 3, 2014].

M. (1999). Reasserting the Philosophy of Experiential Education as a Vehicle for Change in the 21st Century. ''The Journal of Physical Education'' 22(2), p. 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential learning is often used synonymously with the term "[[experiential education]]", but while experiential education is a broader [[philosophy]] of education, experiential learning considers the individual learning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Mary C.|last=Breunig|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHmJdHRbYQQC&amp;pg=PA122|page=122|chapter=Teaching Dewey's ''Experience and Education'' Experientially|title=Teaching Adventure Education Theory:  Best Practices|editor=Stremba, Bob |editor2=Bisson, Christian A.|year=2009|isbn=9780736071260|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, compared to experiential education, experiential learning is concerned with more concrete issues related to the learner and the learning context.

The general concept of learning through experience is ancient.  Around 350 BCE, [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''[[s:Nicomachean Ethics (Chase)/Book_Two|Nicomachean Ethics]]'' "for the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them".&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2, [[D. P. Chase|Chase]] translation (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; But as an articulated educational approach, experiential learning is of much more recent vintage.  Beginning in the 1970s, [[David A. Kolb]] helped to develop the modern theory of experiential learning, drawing heavily on the work of [[John Dewey]], [[Kurt Lewin]], and [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Learning Style|first1=Nancy M.|last1=Dixon|first2=Doris E.|last2=Adams|first3=Richard|last3=Cullins|title=Assessment, Development, and Measurement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8_yKiqe6JwC&amp;pg=PA41|page=41|year=1997|isbn=9781562860493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential learning has significant teaching advantages. [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'' (1990), states that teaching is of utmost importance to motivate people. Learning only has good effects when learners have the desire to absorb the knowledge. Therefore, experiential learning requires the showing of directions for learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawtrey|first1=Kim|title=Using Experiential Learning Techniques|url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2077/docview/235244213?OpenUrlRefId=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo&amp;accountid=2280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kolb experiential learning model==

Experiential learning focuses on the learning process for the individual. One example of experiential learning is going to the zoo and learning through observation and interaction with the zoo environment, as opposed to reading about animals from a book. Thus, one makes discoveries and experiments with knowledge firsthand, instead of hearing or reading about others' experiences. Likewise, in [[business school]], [[internship]], and [[Job shadow|job-shadowing]], opportunities in a student’s field of interest can provide valuable experiential learning which contributes significantly to the student’s overall understanding of the real-world environment.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, P. R., &amp; McCarthy, H. M. (2006). When Case Studies Are Not Enough: Integrating Experiential Learning Into Business Curricula. Journal of Education for Business, 81(4), 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third example of experiential learning involves learning how to ride a bike,&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, R. G. (1994).Bike riding and the art of learning.In L. B. Barnes, C. Roland Christensen, &amp; A. J. Hansen (Eds.), Teaching and the case method.Boston: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a process which can illustrate the four-step experiential learning model (ELM) as set forth by Kolb&lt;ref&gt;Loo, R. (2002). A Meta-Analytic Examination of Kolb's Learning Style Preferences Among Business Majors. Journal of Education for Business, 77:5, 252-256&lt;/ref&gt; and outlined in Figure 1 below. Following this example, in the "concrete experience" stage, the learner physically experiences the bike in the "here-and-now".&lt;ref name=kolb&gt;Kolb, D. (1984). Experiential Learning: experience as the source of learning and development. Englewood  Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  This experience forms "the basis for observation and reflection" and the learner has the opportunity to consider what is working or failing (reflective observation), and to think about ways to improve on the next attempt made at riding (abstract conceptualization). Every new attempt to ride is informed by a cyclical pattern of previous experience, thought and reflection (active experimentation).&lt;ref name=kolb /&gt;

===Elements===

Experiential learning can exist without a teacher and relates solely to the [[meaning-making]] process of the individual's direct experience.  However, though the gaining of knowledge is an inherent process that occurs naturally, a genuine learning experience requires certain elements.&lt;ref name=itin /&gt; According to Kolb, knowledge is continuously gained through both personal and environmental experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sharan Merriam|Merriam, S. B.]], Caffarella, R. S., &amp; Baumgartner, L. M. (2007). ''Learning in adulthood: a comprehensive guide''. San Francisco: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Kolb states that in order to gain genuine knowledge from an experience, the learner must have four abilities:

*The learner must be willing to be actively involved in the experience;
*The learner must be able to reflect on the experience;
*The learner must possess and use analytical skills to conceptualize the experience; and
*The learner must possess decision making and problem solving skills in order to use the new ideas gained from the experience.

==Implementation==
Experiential learning requires self-initiative, an "intention to learn" and an "active phase of learning".&lt;ref name=moon /&gt; Kolb's cycle of experiential [[learning]] can be used as a framework for considering the different stages involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolb|first=D|title=Experiential Learning as the Science of Learning and Development|year=1984|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer A. Moon has elaborated on this cycle to argue that experiential learning is most effective when it involves: 1) a "reflective learning phase" 2) a phase of learning resulting from the actions inherent to experiential learning, and 3) "a further phase of learning from feedback".&lt;ref name=moon /&gt; This process of learning can result in "changes in judgment, feeling or skills" for the individual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chickering|first=A|title=Experience and Learning|year=1977|publisher=Change Magazine Press|location=New York|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and can provide direction for the "making of judgments as a guide to choice and action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=M.|title=Learning from action: a conceptual framework, in S. Warner Weil and M. McGill (eds) Making Sense of Experiential Learning.|year=1980|publisher=SRHE/Open University Press|location=Milton Keynes|pages=50–9, p. 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[educator]]s understand the important role [[experience]] plays in the learning process. The role of [[emotion]] and feelings in learning from experience has been recognised as an important part of experiential learning.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;{{cite book|last=Moon|first=J.|title=A Handbook of Reflective and Experiential Learning:Theory and Practice|year=2004|publisher=Routledge Falmer|location=London|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; While those factors may improve the likelihood of experiential learning occurring, it can occur without them. Rather, what is vital in experiential learning is that the individual is encouraged to directly involve themselves in the experience, and then to reflect on their experiences using analytic skills, in order that they gain a better understanding of the new knowledge and retain the information for a longer time.

Reflection is a crucial part of the experiential learning process, and like experiential learning itself, it can be facilitated or independent. Dewey wrote that "successive portions of reflective thought grow out of one another and support one another", creating a scaffold for further learning, and allowing for further experiences and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Kompf, M., &amp; Bond, R. (2001). Critical reflection in adult education. In T. Barer-Stein &amp; M. Kompf (Eds.), The craft of teaching adults (p. 55). Toronto, ON: Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the fact that experiential learning and reflective learning are iterative processes, and the learning builds and develops with further reflection and experience. Facilitation of experiential learning and reflection is challenging, but "a skilled facilitator, asking the right questions and guiding reflective conversation before, during, and after an experience, can help open a gateway to powerful new thinking and learning".&lt;ref name=ruddy&gt;Jacobson, M. &amp; Ruddy, M. (2004) Open to outcome (p. 2). Oklahoma City, OK: Wood 'N' Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson and Ruddy, building on Kolb's four-stage Experiential Learning Model&lt;ref name=kolb /&gt; and Pfeiffer and Jones's five stage Experiential Learning Cycle,&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, W. &amp; Jones, J. E. (1975). ''A Handbook of Structured Experiences for Human Relations Training''. La Jolla, California: University Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; took these theoretical frameworks and created a simple, practical questioning model for [[facilitator]]s to use in promoting critical reflection in experiential learning. Their "5 Questions" model is as follows:&lt;ref name=ruddy /&gt;
* Did you notice?
* Why did that happen?
* Does that happen in life?
* Why does that happen?
* How can you use that?

These questions are posed by the facilitator after an experience, and gradually lead the group towards a critical reflection on their experience, and an understanding of how they can apply the learning to their own life.&lt;ref name=ruddy /&gt; Although the questions are simple, they allow a relatively inexperienced facilitator to apply the theories of Kolb, Pfeiffer, and Jones, and deepen the learning of the group.

While it is the learner's experience that is most important to the learning process, it is also important not to forget the wealth of experience a good facilitator also brings to the situation. However, while a facilitator, or "teacher", may improve the likelihood of experiential learning occurring, a facilitator is not essential to experiential learning. Rather, the mechanism of experiential learning is the learner's reflection on experiences using analytic skills. This can occur without the presence of a facilitator, meaning that experiential learning is not defined by the presence of a facilitator. Yet, by considering experiential learning in developing course or program content, it provides an opportunity to develop a framework for adapting varying [[teaching]]/learning techniques into the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, C. A. (2004). The importance level of ten teaching/learning techniques as rated by university business students and instructors. Journal of Management Development, 23(2), 169-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiential learning is supported in different [[school organizational models]] and [[learning environment]]s.
* [[Think Global School]] is a four-year traveling high school that holds classes in a new country each term. Students engage in experiential learning through activities such as workshops, cultural exchanges, museum tours, and nature expeditions.
*The Dawson School in [[Boulder, Colorado]], devotes two weeks of each school year to experiential learning, with students visiting surrounding states to engage in community service, visit museums and scientific institutions, and engage in activities such as [[mountain biking]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and [[canoe]]ing.
*In the ELENA-Project, the follow-up project of "animals live", experiential learning with living animals will be developed. Together with project partners from Romania, Hungary and Georgia, the Bavarian Academy of Nature Conservation and Landscape Management in Germany brings living animals in the lessons of European schools. The aim is to brief children for the context of the biological diversity and to support them to develop ecologically oriented values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anl.bayern.de/english/research/elena/index.htm ELENA project leader]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loving High School in [[Loving, New Mexico]], publishes career and technical education opportunities for students. These include internship for students who are interested in science, STEM majors, or architecture. The school is making good connections with local businesses, which helps students get used to working in such environments.
*Lake View High School in [[Chicago, Illinois]] is the institution which offers early college credits for students. It trains students with majors such as STEM, humanities, music/ art, and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Noodle|title=41 Most Innovative K–12 Schools in America|url=https://www.noodle.com/articles/innovative-schools-2015#lake|accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]] offers select [[undergraduate students]] a year-round advanced course whereby students conduct financial analyses and security trades on [[Bloomberg Terminal]]s to manage real investment dollars in the [[Lemma Senbet Fund]].

==In business education==
As higher education continues to adapt to new expectations from students, experiential learning in business and accounting programs has become more important. For example, Clark &amp; White (2010) point out that "a quality university business education program must include an experiential learning component".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J., &amp; White, G. (2010). "Experiential Learning: A Definitive Edge In The Job Market". ''American Journal of Business Education'', 3(2), pp. 115-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  With reference to this study, employers note that graduating students need to build skills in "professionalism" – which can be taught via experiential learning. Students also value this learning as much as industry.

Learning styles also impact business education in the classroom. Kolb transposes four learning styles, ''Diverger, Assimilator, Accommodator '' and ''Converger'', atop the Experiential Learning Model, using the four experiential learning stages to carve out "four quadrants", one for each learning style. An individual’s dominant learning style can be identified by taking Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory (LSI). Robert Loo (2002) undertook a meta-analysis of 8 studies which revealed that Kolb’s learning styles were not equally distributed among business majors in the sample.&lt;ref name=loo&gt;Loo, R. (2002). "A Meta-Analytic Examination of Kolb's Learning Style Preferences Among Business Majors". ''Journal of Education for Business'', 77:5, 252-256&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, results indicated that there appears to be a high proportion of assimilators and a lower proportion of accommodators than expected for business majors. Not surprisingly, within the accounting sub-sample there was a higher proportion of convergers and a lower proportion of accommodates. Similarly, in the finance sub-sample, a higher proportion of assimilators and lower proportion of divergers was apparent. Within the marketing sub-sample there was an equal distribution of styles. This would provide some evidence to suggest that while it is useful for educators to be aware of common learning styles within business and accounting programs, they should be encouraging students to use all four learning styles appropriately and students should use a wide range of learning methods.&lt;ref name=loo /&gt;

Professional education applications, also known as management training or [[organizational development]], apply experiential learning techniques in training employees at all levels within the business and professional environment. Interactive, role-play based customer service training is often used in large retail chains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multimediaplus.com/2014/07/08/experiential-learning/&lt;/ref&gt; Training board games simulating business and professional situations such as the [[Beer Distribution Game]] used to teach supply chain management, and the [[Friday Night at the ER]] game used to teach [[systems thinking]], are used in business training efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Experiential business learning''' is the process of learning and developing business skills through the medium of shared experience.  The main point of difference between this and academic learning is more “real-life” experience for the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://infed.org/mobi/david-a-kolb-on-experiential-learning/|title=David A. Kolb on experiential learning.|date=2013-04-26|work=infed.org|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewing.co.uk/research/experiential.learning.htm|title=Experiential learning articles + critiques of David Kolb's theory|last=Greenaway|first=Tim Pickles and Roger|website=www.reviewing.co.uk|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/05/08/seven-mentorship-methods-and-opportunities-entrepreneurs-should-remember/#7663ca7f63b4|title=Seven Mentorship Methods And Opportunities Entrepreneurs Should Remember|last=Council|first=Young Entrepreneur|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may include for example, learning gained from a [[expert network|network]] of business leaders sharing best practice, or individuals being [[Mentoring|mentored]] or coached by a person who has faced similar challenges and issues, or simply listening to an [[expert]] or [[thought leader]] in current business thinking.

Providers of this type of experiential business learning often include membership organisations who offer product offerings such as peer group learning, professional business networking, expert/speaker sessions, mentoring and/or coaching.

==Comparisons==
[[File:Learning_Retention_Pyramid.JPG|thumb|Experiential Learning is more efficient than passive learning such as reading or listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015 Skill Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Experiential learning is most easily compared with [[academic|academic learning]], the process of acquiring information through the study of a subject without the necessity for direct experience. While the dimensions of experiential learning are [[analysis]], [[initiative]], and immersion, the dimensions of academic learning are [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructive learning]] and reproductive learning.&lt;ref&gt;Stavenga de Jong, J. A., Wierstra, R. F. A. and Hermanussen, J. (2006) "An exploration of the relationship between academic and experiential learning approaches in vocational education", ''British Journal of Educational Psychology''. 76;1. pp. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Though both methods aim at instilling new knowledge in the learner, academic learning does so through more abstract, classroom-based techniques, whereas experiential learning actively involves the learner in a concrete experience.

==Benefits==
* Experience real world: For example, students who major in Chemistry may have chances to interact with the chemical environment. Learners who have a desire to become businesspeople will have the opportunity to experience the manager position
* Opportunities for creativity: There is always more than one solution for a problem in the real world. Students will have a better chance to learn that lesson when they get to interact with real life experiences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Experiential Learning|url=https://www.envisionexperience.com/blog/the-benefits-of-experiential-learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flashnotes''' is an online marketplace that allows college students to buy and sell course specific notes, study guides, flashcards and other items to help students study and/or earn money throughout their college years.

== History ==
In December 2009, Flashnotes was founded by [[Kent State University]] student Michael Matousek.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/news_article.aspx?storyid=155466&amp;catid=45&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing other students struggle in several classes, and hearing them constantly ask to borrow other students' notes, Matousek created a solution that would help classmates by providing additional, student-created study resources. The result was Flashnotes. In 2012, Flashnotes moved to Boston.  Flashnotes has partnered with other education companies including Cengage and Barnes and Nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnes &amp; Noble Education invests in online college study guide marketplace Flashnotes|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/09/barnes-noble-education-invests-in-online-college-study-guide-marketplace/|website=Fox News|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, this organization raised $3.6M in the funding round that included Stage 1 Ventures, Runa Capital and Atlas Ventures as the main investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/03/flashnotes-a-peer-to-peer-marketplace-for-college-study-materials-picks-up-another-3-6m/|title=Flashnotes, A Peer-To-Peer Marketplace For College Study Materials, Picks Up Another $3.6M|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Flashnotes purchased Moolaguides, a Florida-based ed-tech start-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/04/flashnotes-buys-moolaguides-consolidating-the-market-for-crowdsource-online-study-materials/|title=Flashnotes Buys Moolaguides, Consolidating The Market For Crowdsourced, Online Study Materials|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015, the platform was called Luvo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/note-sharing-marketplace-flashnotes-wound-down-330662|title=Note-sharing marketplace Flashnotes wound down {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/03/flashnotes-a-peer-to-peer-marketplace-for-college-study-materials-picks-up-another-3-6m/|title=Flashnotes, A Peer-To-Peer Marketplace For College Study Materials, Picks Up Another $3.6M|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, Flashnotes raised up to $14 million from different funding rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-05-24-gone-in-a-flash-student-notes-marketplace-luvo-formerly-flashnotes-shuts-down|title=Gone in a Flash: Student Notes Marketplace, Luvo (Formerly Flashnotes) Shuts Down - EdSurge News|date=2016-05-24|work=EdSurge|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Flashnotes works a reference tool for college students that are looking for additional help while studying for a variety of college courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wkbn.com/content/news/local/story/Students-Selling-Notes-Through-Youngstown-Based/-Bz_3LCVPk6xNcaPii9E8w.cspx |title=Students selling notes zhrough Youngstown-based website |newspaper=[[WKBN-TV]] |date=December 8, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720081947/http://www.wkbn.com/content/news/local/story/Students-Selling-Notes-Through-Youngstown-Based/-Bz_3LCVPk6xNcaPii9E8w.cspx |archivedate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashnotes can also be a way for students to make extra money during their college years. Students interested in sharing their notes must create an account with the site. Then, they can upload as many notes as they want, and set their own price for each set of notes. If the notes are sold, the student keeps 70% of the price of the notes, while Flashnotes keeps the other 30%. Once the notes have been uploaded to the site, other students with an account can browse through all of the notes available at their school, narrow the search by course number or subject, or even search through all of the notes available from students at other colleges and universities throughout the country.

== Schools ==
Flashnotes is currently being used to buy and sell notes at 367 colleges and universities throughout the [[United States]] and Bishop's University in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]]. If a user is the first person to upload notes from their school, that college or university will be added to the list of schools as soon as the notes have been uploaded.

'''Humanistic education''' (also called '''person-centered education''') is an approach to education based on the work of [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic psychologists]], most notably [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]].&lt;ref name="Clark 218"&gt;{{cite book|last=Power|first=F. Clark|title=Moral Education|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313336474|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Eric|title=Human relations in education|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=041502532X|pages=14|author2=Carol Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Rogers has been called{{by whom|date=February 2014}} the "Father of Humanistic Psychology" and devoted much of his efforts toward applying the results of his psychological research to person-centered teaching where empathy, caring about students, and genuineness on the part of the learning facilitator were found to be the key traits of the most effective teachers{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. He edited a series of books dealing with humanistic education in his "Studies of the Person Series," which included his book, ''Freedom to Learn''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R. ''Freedom to Learn''. Columbus, Ohio: Charles E. Merrill, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Learning to Feel - Feeling to Learn - Humanistic Education for the Whole Man,'' by Harold C. Lyon, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Harold C. Jr. ''Learning to Feel - Feeling to Learn''. Columbus, OH: Charles E. Merrill. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the term "humanistic education" became less popular after conservative groups equated it with "Secular Humanism" and attacked the writings of Harold Lyon as being anti-Christian. That began a successful effort by Aspy, Lyon, Rogers, and others to re-label it "person-centered teaching", replacing the term "humanistic education."  In a more general sense the term includes the work of other humanistic pedagogues, such as [[Rudolf Steiner]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Waldorf Schools offer an approach to humanistic education which has stood the test of time." Sarah W. Foster, "An Introduction to Waldorf Education", ''The Clearing House'', Vol. 57, No. 5 (Jan., 1984), pp. 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Leonard, ''Pedagogies of the Imagination: Mythopoetic Curriculum in Educational Practice'', Springer 2008, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. C. S. Trahair, ''Utopias and Utopians: an historical dictionary'', Greenwood Press, 1999, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria Montessori]]. All of these approaches seek to engage the "whole person"{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}: the intellect, feeling life{{clarify|date=February 2014}}, social capacities, and artistic and practical skills are all important focuses for growth and development. Important objectives include developing children's self-esteem, their ability to set and achieve appropriate goals, and their development toward full [[autonomy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==History==
Humanistic education has its roots in [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance philosophers]] who emphasised the study of [[the humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy; these in turn built upon Classical models of education.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Oskar Kristeller, Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing Humanist-inspired emphasis on [[education in Scotland]] cumulated with the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]].

== Principles ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2012}}

=== Choice and control ===
The [[humanistic]] approach places a great deal of emphasis on students' choice and control over the course of their [[education]]. Students are encouraged to make choices that range from day-to-day activities to periodically setting future life goals. This allows for students to focus on a specific subject of interest for any amount of time they choose, within reason. Humanistic teachers believe it is important for students to be motivated and engaged in the material they are [[learning]], and this happens when the topic is something the students need and want to know.

=== Felt concerns ===
Humanistic [[education]] tends to focus on the felt concerns and interests of the students intertwining with the [[intellect]]. It is believed that the overall mood and feeling of the students can either hinder or foster the process of [[learning]].

=== The whole person ===
Humanistic [[educator]]s believe that both feelings and [[knowledge]] are important to the [[learning]] process. Unlike traditional educators, humanistic teachers do not separate the [[cognitive]] and affective domains. This aspect also relates to the curriculum in the sense that lessons and activities provide focus on various aspects of the student and not just rote memorization through note taking and lecturing.

=== Self evaluation ===
Humanistic [[educator]]s believe that grades are irrelevant and that only self-evaluation is meaningful. Grading encourages students to work for a grade and not for intrinsic satisfaction. Humanistic educators disagree with routine testing because they teach students rote memorization as opposed to meaningful [[learning]]. They also believe testing doesn't provide sufficient [[educational]] feedback to the teacher.

=== Teacher as a facilitator ===
"The tutor or lecturer tends to be more supportive than critical, more understanding than judgmental, more genuine than playing a role." &lt;ref&gt;Rowan, J. (n.d.). Humanistic education. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.ahpweb.org/rowan_bibliography/chapter17.html |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028171856/http://www.ahpweb.org/rowan_bibliography/chapter17.html |archivedate=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their job is to foster an engaging environment for the students and ask inquiry-based questions that promote meaningful learning.

===Field studies on humanistic education===
David Aspy and Flora Roebuck performed the largest field study ever done{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, in 42 states and 7 countries, in the 1970s and 80s, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health over a 12-year period, focusing on what led to achievement, [[creativity]], more student thinking and interactivity, less violence, and both teacher and student satisfaction. Their conclusions corroborated the earlier findings of Carl Rogers's that the more effective teachers were empathic, caring for or prizing their students, and were authentic or genuine in their classroom presence.&lt;ref&gt;Aspy, David, and Roebuck, Flora:  (1977) ''Kids Don't Learn from People They Don't Like'' Amherst, MA: Human Resources Development Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Jeffrey Cornelius-White and Adam Harbaugh published a large meta-analysis on Learner Centered Instruction including in their analysis all the higher quality studies on person-centered or humanistic education ever done since 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. and Harbaugh, A: (2010) ''Learner Centered Instruction ''Los Angeles: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Rogers, Lyon, and Tausch published ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher -- Person-centered Teaching, [[Psychology]], [[Philosophy]], and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon'',&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, CR, Lyon, Harold C. Jr, and Tausch: (2013) ''On Becoming an Effective Teacher- On–Person-centered Teaching, [[Psychology]], [[Philosophy]], and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and HaroldLyon''.&amp;nbsp;London Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; which contained Rogers' last unpublished work on teaching and documented the research results of four highly related, independent studies which comprise the largest collection of data ever accumulated{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} to test a person-centered theory in the field of [[education]].

{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}

=== In environment ===
The [[Built environment|environment]] in a school which focuses their practice on humanistic [[education]] tends to have a very different setting than a traditional school. It consist of both indoor and outdoor environments with a majority of time being spent outdoors. The indoor setting may contain a few tables and chairs, bean bags for quiet reading and relaxation, book shelves, hide-aways, kitchens, lots of color and art posted on the walls. The outdoor environment is very engaging for students. You might find tree houses, outdoor kitchens, sand boxes, play sets, natural materials, sporting activities etc. The wide range of activities are offered for students allowing for free choices of interest.

==Related movements==
A number of contemporary school movements incorporate humanistic perspectives within a larger, holistic context: these include the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]], [[Montessori education|Montessori]], [[Reggio Emilia]], and [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] schools. These originated independently of the humanistic psychology movement and at least some of them incorporate spiritual perspectives absent from the traditional humanistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Lucila Telles Rudge, [http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi/Rudge%20Lucila%20T.pdf?osu1213289333 "Holistic Education: An Analysis of its Pedagogical Application"], dissertation, Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt;

'''iSpring Suite''' is a [[rapid learning]] [[Authoring system|authoring toolkit]] produced by iSpring for developing training  courses in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] with embedded (or standalone) quizzes, surveys, and interactions. Its output is compatible with mainstream [[Learning management system|LMS]] standards ([[SCORM]]/[[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Creating_SCORM_Content|title=Creating SCORM Content|work=docs.moodle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispringsolutions.com/articles/lms_support.html|title=LMS support|work=ispringsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and there is also an option to publish courses specially for [[Blackboard Learning System|BlackBoard LMS]]. The new [[Tin Can API|xAPI (Tin Can)]] format for [[Learning Record Store|LRSes]] is supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tincanapi.com/adopters|title=Adopters|work=tincanapi.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Output can be a solid [[SWF| SWF file(s)]], [[EXE| EXE file]], [[HTML]] page or [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]] archive. Additionally, the cross-platform output format ([[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]]) allows published content to be viewed on any type of modern device.

==History==
In 2005, Flashspring Pro, the prototype of all iSpring products, was released. It was a simple PowerPoint-to-Flash converter with free and commercial versions. Later, iSpring released Flashspring Ultra and [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model|SCORM]] compatibility became available. The companion products FlashSpring Lite and FlashSpring Server were released in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the name was changed to iSpring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/745/making-sense-of-powerpoint-pandemonium|title=Making Sense of PowerPoint Pandemonium|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current version of iSpring Suite, iSpring Suite 9.0, came out in April 24th, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/press-releases/ispring-suite-9-fast-toolkit-creating-elearning-slides-quizzes-videos|title=iSpring Suite 9: Fast Toolkit For Creating eLearning Slides, Quizzes, And Videos|work=elearningindustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Instructional Materials''' are any collection of materials including [[animate]] and inanimate objects and human and non-human resources that a teacher may use in teaching and learning situations to help achieve desired learning objectives.  Instructional materials may aid a student in concretizing a learning experience so as to make learning more exciting, interesting and interactive.
They are tools used in instructional activities, which include active learning and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/relevance-of-the-use-of-instructional-materials-in-teaching-and-pedagogical-delivery/48956|work=global dictionary|accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term encompasses all the materials and physical means an instructor might use to implement instruction and facilitate students achievement of instructional objectives.

The value of instructional materials as a pedagogical aid can be seen in [[Vachel Lindsay]]'s poem "Euclid":
{{Quote
|text=&lt;poem&gt;Old [[Euclid]] drew a circle
On a sand-beach, long ago.
He bounded and enclosed it
With angles thus and so.

His set of solemn greybeards
Nodded and argued much
Of [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] and of circumference
Diameter and such.

A silent child stood by them
From morning until noon,
Because they drew such charming
Round pictures of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Poetry: A Magazine of Verse |volume=II |date=April–September 1913 |editor1-last=Monroe |editor1-first=Harriet |last=Lindsay |first=Vachel |chapter=Euclid |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IcVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Evaluation of Instructional Materials==
===Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online (PRIMO) Committee===
The Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online (PRIMO) Committee "'promotes and shares peer-reviewed instructional materials created by librarians to teach people about discovering, accessing and evaluating information in networked environments.' In doing so, it reviews librarian-created online tutorials dealing with information literacy and critical thinking skills, and highlights the highest-caliber projects through its “Site of the Month” posts on the ACRL Instruction Section blog (http://acrl.ala.org/IS/category/committees/primo)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaspar |first1=Wendy |last2=Borgerding |first2=Jodie |date=2017 |title=PRIMO: Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online |url=https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16563/18009 |journal=College and Research Libraries (Online) |volume=78 |pages=2–7 |doi=10.5860/crl.78.1.2 |access-date=July 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PRIMO's goal is to provide librarians quality tutorials for instructional use on a variety of topics in order to save time, effort and cost.  PRIMO accepts non-promotional online instructional material intended for undergraduate or graduate-level audiences emphasizing quality over comprehensiveness.

===Instructional Materials Evaluation Tool===
"Student Achievement Partners is a nonprofit organization that assembles educators and researchers to design actions based on evidence that will substantially improve student achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Kindergarten''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|n|d|ər|ˌ|g|ɑːr|t|ən}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=GT Kindergarten AE.ogg|US|-|d|ən}}; from [[German language|German]] {{IPA-de|ˈkɪndɐˌɡaːɐ̯tn̩||GT Kindergarten deutsch.ogg}}, literally meaning 'garden for the children')&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined in the metaphorical sense of "place where children can grow in a natural way", not in the literal sense of having a "garden".&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[preschool]] educational approach based on playing, singing, practical activities such as drawing, and social interaction as part of the transition from home to school. Such institutions were originally created in the late 18th century in [[Bavaria]] and [[Strasbourg]] to serve children whose parents both worked outside home. The term was coined by the German [[Friedrich Fröbel]], whose approach globally influenced early-years education. Today, the term is used in many countries to describe a variety of [[educational institution]]s and [[learning space]]s for children ranging from two to seven years of age, based on a variety of teaching methods.
==History==
[[File:Max_Liebermann_Kleinkinderschule_in_Amsterdam_1880.jpg|thumb|Kindergarten in Amsterdam 1880, by [[Max Liebermann]]]]In 1779, [[Johann Friedrich Oberlin]] and Louise Scheppler founded in [[Strasbourg]] an early establishment for caring for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lorenzo Knapp (1843), ''Female biography; containing notices of distinguished women, in different nations and ages''. Philadelphia: Thomas Wardle. p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, in 1780, similar infant establishments were established in [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Berger, [http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/414.html "Kurze Chronik der ehemaligen und gegenwärtigen Ausbildungsstätten für Kleinkindlehrerinnen, Kindergärtnerinnen, Hortnerinnen ... und ErzieherInnen in Bayern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904234012/http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/414.html |date=September 4, 2013 }} in "Das Kita-Handbuch", ed. Martin R. Textor&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, Princess [[Pauline zur Lippe]] established a preschool center in [[Detmold]], the capital of the then principality of Lippe, Germany (now in the State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://raratheme.com/preview/preschool-and-kindergarten/2017/02/07/learning-is-fun-at-kinder-school/|title=Learning is fun at Kinder School|date=February 7, 2017|work=Preschool and Kindergarten|access-date=April 18, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816, [[Robert Owen]], a philosopher and [[pedagogue]], opened the first British and probably globally the first infants school in [[New Lanark]], Scotland.&lt;ref name="vag75"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/9248527032015273/ |title=The Influence of the English Infant School in Hungary |first=Otto |last=Vag |journal=International Journal of Early Childhood |publisher=Springer |volume=7|issue=1 |date=March 1975|pages=132–136 |doi=10.1007/bf03175934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlanark.org/kids/index2.html|title=New Lanark Kids|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-owen.htm|title=infed.org - Education in Robert Owen’s new society: the New Lanark institute and schools|work=infed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with his venture for [[cooperative]] mills Owen wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work.

[[Samuel Wilderspin]] opened his first infant school in London in 1819,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGYWAAAAIAAJ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Importance of Educating the Infant Poor|year=1823|first=Samuel|last=Wilderspin|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to establish hundreds more. He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing the [[playground]]. In 1823, Wilderspin published ''On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor'', based on the school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also wrote ''The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers of all children from 1 to seven years of age''.

[[File:Frederick-Froebel-Bardeen.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Friedrich Fröbel]] was one of the most influential founders of kindergartens, and he coined the name in 1840.]]
Countess [[Theresa Brunszvik]] (1775–1861), who had known and been influenced by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], was influenced by this example to open an ''Angyalkert'' ("angel garden" in Hungarian) on May 27, 1828, in her residence in [[Budapest|Buda]], the first of eleven care centers that she founded for young children.&lt;ref&gt;Budapest Lexikon, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Preschool Education In Hungary: A Historical Survey, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 she established an institute for the foundation of preschool centers. The idea became popular among the nobility and the middle class and was copied throughout the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

[[Friedrich Fröbel]] (1782–1852) opened a "play and activity" institute in 1837 in the village of [[Bad Blankenburg]] in the [[principality]] of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]], Thuringia, as an experimental social experience for children entering school. He renamed his institute ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' on June 28, 1840, reflecting his belief that children should be nurtured and nourished "like plants in a garden".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fi/books?id=QfBV-nd1bqAC&amp;q=p%C3%A4dagogischen+n%C3%A4hrbodens#v=snippet&amp;q=p%C3%A4dagogischen%20n%C3%A4hrbodens&amp;f=false Kinder bilden Sprache - Sprache bildet Kinder], p. 24 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Women trained by Fröbel opened kindergartens throughout Europe and around the world. The [[First Kindergarten|first kindergarten]] in the US was founded in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856 and was conducted in German by Margaretha Meyer-Schurz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watertownhistory.org Watertown Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Peabody]] founded the first English-language kindergarten in the US in 1860. The first free kindergarten in the US was founded in 1870 by [[Conrad Poppenhusen]], a German industrialist and philanthropist, who also established the [[Poppenhusen Institute]]. The first publicly financed kindergarten in the US was established in [[St. Louis]] in 1873 by [[Susan Blow]].

Canada's first private kindergarten was opened by the [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan Methodist Church]] in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], in 1870. By the end of the decade, they were common in large Canadian towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, M.I. 1955.

[[File:AF-kindergarten.jpg|frame|A kindergarten classroom in Afghanistan]]

In [[Afghanistan]], children between the ages of 3 and 6 attend kindergartens ({{lang-prs|کودکستان}}; {{lang-ps|وړکتون}}). Although kindergartens in Afghanistan are not part of the school system, they are often run by the government.

Early Childhood Development programs were first introduced during the Soviet occupation with the establishment in 1980 of 27 urban preschools, or kodakistan. The number of preschools grew steadily during the 1980s, peaking in 1990 with more than 270 in Afghanistan. At this peak, there were 2,300 teachers caring for more than 21,000 children in the country. These facilities were an urban phenomenon, mostly in Kabul, and were attached to schools, government offices, or factories. Based on the Soviet model, these Early Childhood Development programs provided nursery care, preschool, and kindergarten for children from 3 months to 6 years of age under the direction of the Department of Labor and Social Welfare.

The vast majority of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many of these families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/pre-school centers serving over 25,000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia}}
In each state of Australia, ''kindergarten'' (frequently referred to as "kinder" or "kindy") means something slightly different. In [[Tasmania]], New South Wales and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], it is the first year of primary school. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], kindergarten is a form of [[preschool]] and may be referred to interchangeably as preschool or kindergarten. In Victoria and Tasmania, the phrase for the first year of primary school is called ''Prep'' (short for "preparatory"), which is followed by grade 1. 

In Queensland, kindergarten is usually an institution for children around the age of 4 and thus it is the precursor to preschool and primary education. In recent years though, Kindergartens have been taking children as young as 6 months old. 

The year preceding the first year of primary school education in Western Australia, South Australia or the [[Northern Territory]] is referred to respectively as ''pre-primary'', ''reception'' or ''transition''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.det.wa.edu.au/education/ece/enrolments.html#compare&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|Education in Bangladesh}}
In [[Bangladesh]], the term "kindergarten", or "KG School" (Kindergarten School), is used to refer to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. The names of the levels are nursery, ''shishu'' (children), etc. But the view of kindergarten education has changed much from previous years. Almost every rural area now has at least one Kindergarten School, with most being run in the [[Bengali language]]. They also follow the textbooks published by the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with a light modification, adding some extra books in syllabus. The grades generally start from Nursery (sometimes "Play"), "KG" afterwards, and ends with the 5th grade. Separate from the National Education System, kindergarten is contributing greatly toward achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] of universal primary education in Bangladesh.

===Bulgaria===
{{see also|Education in Bulgaria}}
In [[Bulgaria]], the term ''detska gradina'' (деτска градина) refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 7 (in some cases 6) years of age. Since 2012, two years of pre-school education are compulsory. These two years of mandatory pre-school education may be attended either at kindergarten or in preparatory groups at primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eli-net.eu/fileadmin/ELINET/Redaktion/user_upload/Bulgarian_Short_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

[[File:Student teachers Kindergarten 1898.jpg|thumb|Student teachers training in a kindergarten class in 1898 in Toronto, Canada]]

Schools outside of Ontario and the Northwest Territories generally provide one year of kindergarten, except some private schools offer junior kindergarten for 4-year-olds (school before kindergarten is most commonly referred to as pre-school). After kindergarten, the child begins grade one. The province of [[Nova Scotia]] refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.

The province of Ontario and the Northwest Territories provide two years of kindergarten. Within the province of [[Quebec]], junior kindergarten is called ''prématernelle'' (which is not mandatory), is attended by 4-year-olds, and senior kindergarten is called ''maternelle'', which is also not mandatory by the age of 5, this class is integrated into primary schools. Within the French school system in the province of [[Ontario]], junior kindergarten is called ''maternelle'' and senior kindergarten is called ''jardin d'enfants'', which is a [[calque]] of the German word ''Kindergarten''.

===Chile===
{{see also|Education in Chile}}
In Chile, the term equivalent to Kindergarten is "''Educación parvularia''", sometimes also called "''Educación Preescolar''". It is the first level of the [[Education in Chile|Chilean educational system]]. It meets the needs of boys and girls integrally from their birth until their entry to the ''Educación Básica'' (Primary education), without being considered as compulsory. Generally, schools imparting this level, the JUNJI (National Council of Kindergarten Schools) and other private institutions have the following organization of groups or subcategories of levels:
*'''Low nursery:''' It addresses babies from 85 days to 1 year old.
*'''High nursery:''' It addresses children from 1 to 2 years old.
*'''Low Middle Level:''' It addresses children from 2 to 3 years old.
*'''High Middle Level:''' It addresses children from 3 to 4 years old.
*'''First level of transition:''' Often called "''Pre-kinder''", it addresses children from 4 to 5 years old.
*'''Second level of transition''': Usually called "''Kinder''", it addresses children from 5 to 6 years old. It is the last phase of this type of education, by finishing it, children go to "''Primero Básico''" ([[First grade]] of primary education).&lt;ref&gt;[http://600.mineduc.cl/docs/informacion/info_guia/guia_parv.pdf Chilean Ministry of Education – Help Guide, Educación Parvularia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707011709/http://600.mineduc.cl/docs/informacion/info_guia/guia_parv.pdf |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

[[File:北京师范大学实验幼儿园 - Experimental Kindergarten of Beijing Normal University - 2010.11 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Chinese kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools are sometimes affiliated with tertiary institutions, e.g. Experimental Kindergarten of [[Beijing Normal University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
In China, pre-school education, before the child enters formal schooling at 6 years of age, is generally divided into a "nursery" or "preschool" stage and a "kindergarten" (幼儿园 (yòu'éryuán) stage. These can be two separate institutions, or a single combined one in different areas. Where there are two separate institutions, it is common for the kindergarten to consist of the two upper years, and the preschool to consist of one lower year. Common names for these three years are:
# Nursery (or "preschool" or "playgroup")  (小班/xiăo bān): 3- to 4-year-old children
# Lower Kindergarten (中班/zhōng bān): 4- to 5-year-old children
# Upper Kindergarten (大班/dà bān): 5- to 6-year-old children.

In some places, children at 5-6 years may in addition or instead attend "reception" or "preparatory" classes (学前班/xué qián bān) focusing on preparing children for formal schooling.

State (public) kindergartens only accept children older than 3 years, while private ones do not have such limitations.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Danish pre-school education}}

Kindergarten is a day-care service offered to children from age three until the child starts attending school. Kindergarten classes (grade 0) are voluntary and are offered by primary schools before a child enters 1st grade.

Two-thirds of established day-care institutions in [[Denmark]] are municipal day-care centres while the other third are privately owned and are run by associations of parents or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject-matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles.

Denmark is credited with pioneering (although not inventing) [[forest kindergarten]]s, in which children spend most of every day outside in a natural environment.

===Egypt===

In Egypt, children may go to kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===France===

{{see also|Education in France}}
In France, pre-school is known as ''{{lang|fr|école maternelle}}'' (French for "nursery school", literally "maternal school"). Free ''{{lang|fr|maternelle}}'' schools are available throughout the country, welcoming children aged from 3 to 6 (although in many places, children under three may not be granted a place). The ages are divided into ''{{lang|fr|grande section}}'' (GS: 5-year-olds), ''{{lang|fr|moyenne section}}'' (MS: 4-year-olds), ''{{lang|fr|petite section}}'' (PS: 3-year-olds) and ''{{lang|fr|toute petite section}}'' (TPS: 2-year-olds). It is not compulsory, yet almost all children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-37156-0001, Beentz, Erntekindergartengruppe.jpg|thumb|(East) German Kindergarten, 1956]]

In Germany, a ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' (masculine: ''der'' Kindergarten, plural ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'') is a facility for the care of pre-school children who are typically at least three years old. By contrast, ''{{lang|de|Kinderkrippe}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Krippe}}'' refers to a crèche for the care of children before they enter ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' (9 weeks to about three years), ''{{lang|de|Kindertagesstätte}}''—literally "children's day site", usually shortened to ''{{lang|de|Kita}}''—is an [[umbrella term]] for any day care facility for pre-schoolers.

Attendance is voluntary, and usually not free of charge. Pre-school children over the age of one are entitled to receive local and affordable daycare.&lt;ref name="SGBVIII24"&gt;Achtes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch, §24;  children under the age of one are entitled to daycare if the caretaker is working, seeking work or attending school (section one); children from one to three years (section two) and from over three until they enter school (section three) are unconditionally entitled to receive day care.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the federal system, {{lang|de|Kindergärten}} fall under the responsibility of the [[States of Germany|states]],&lt;ref name="GG30"&gt;Grundgesetz Artikel 30, "Kulturhoheit der Länder"&lt;/ref&gt; which usually delegate a large share of the responsibility to the municipalities. Due to the [[subsidiarity principle]] stipulated by §4 [[:de:Achtes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch|SGB VIII]], there are a multitude of operators, from municipalities, churches and welfare societies to parents' initiatives and profit-based corporations. Many {{lang|de|Kindergärten}} follow a certain educational approach, such as [[Montessori]], [[Reggio Emilia approach|Reggio Emilia]], "{{lang|de|Berliner Bildungsprogramm}}" or [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]]; [[forest kindergarten]]s are well established. Most ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.

Even in smaller townships, there are often both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] kindergartens available. Places in crèches and kindergarten are often difficult to secure and must be 'reserved' in advance, although the situation has improved with a new law in effect August 2013. The availability of childcare, however, varies greatly by region. It is usually better in eastern regions, and in big cities in the north, such as Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/welcome-to-berlin/family-friendly-city/daycare|title=Child care in Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hamburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/news/germanys-child-care-law-aims-get-more-moms-back-work-111198|title=Germany’s child care law aims to get more moms back to work  - WBEZ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poorest in parts of [[Southern Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/law-goes-into-effect-requiring-child-care-for-most-german-children-a-914320.html|title=Law Goes into Effect Requiring Child Care for Most German Children|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=August 1, 2013|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All caretakers in ''{{lang|de|Kita}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Kindergarten}}'' must have a three-year qualified education, or are under special supervision during training.

''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' can be open from 7am to 5pm or longer and may also house a crèche (''{{lang|de|Kinderkrippe}}'') for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon ''{{lang|de|Hort}}'' (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged 6 to 10 who spend the time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day-care nurses (''{{lang|de|Tagesmütter}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Tagespflegepersonen}}'') working independently of any pre-school institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children, typically up to the age of three. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.

The term ''{{lang|de|Vorschule}}'' ("pre-school") is used both for educational efforts in ''{{lang|de|Kindergärten}}'' and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each [[States of Germany|German state]]. The ''{{lang|de|Schulkindergarten}}'' is a type of ''{{lang|de|Vorschule}}''.

===Hong Kong===
{{see also|Education in Hong Kong}}
Pre-primary Services in [[Hong Kong]] refers to provision of education and care to young children by kindergartens and child care centres. Kindergartens, registered with the Education Bureau, provide services for children from three to six years old. Child care centres, on the other hand, are registered with the Social Welfare Department and include nurseries, catering for children aged two to three, and creches, looking after infants from birth to two.

At present, most of the kindergartens operate on half-day basis offering upper, lower kindergarten classes and nursery classes. Some kindergartens operate full-day kindergarten classes too. Child care centres also provide full-day and half-day services with most centres providing full-day services.

The aim of pre-primary education in Hong Kong is to provide children with a relaxing and pleasurable learning environment to promote a balanced development of different aspects necessary to a child's development such as the physical, intellectual, language, social, emotional and aesthetic aspects.

To help establish the culture of self-evaluation in kindergartens and to provide reference for the public in assessing the quality and standard of pre-primary education, the Education Bureau has developed Performance Indicators for pre-primary institutions in Hong Kong. Commencing in the 2000/01 school year, Quality Assurance Inspection was launched to further promote the development of quality Early Childhood Education.

===Hungary===
{{see also|Education in Hungary}}
[[File:OVODA.jpg|thumb|A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pre-school class having outdoor activities, March 2007]]
In [[Hungary]] a kindergarten is called an ''{{lang|hu|óvoda}}'' ("place for caring"). Children attend kindergarten between ages 3–6/7 (they go to school in the year in which they have their 7th birthday). Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from the age of 3 years, though exceptions are made for developmental reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp;#91;tt_news&amp;#93;=9571 Hungary lowers mandatory school age to three] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222936/http://www.caboodle.hu/nc/news/news_archive/single_page/?tx_ttnews&amp; |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though kindergartens may include programs in subjects such as foreign languages and music, children spend most of their time playing. In their last year, children begin to be prepared to attend elementary school.

Most kindergartens are state-funded. Kindergarten teachers are required to have a diploma.

===India===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Baroda High School, Alkapuri]] --&gt;
{{see also|Education in India}}
In [[India]], there are only informal directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation. Directives state that children who are three years old on 30 May in the given academic year are eligible to attend Nursery and Kindergarten classes. Typically, children spend 3 to 4 years of their time in pre-primary school after which they are eligible to attend 1st Standard in Primary School which falls under HRD ministry norms. Primary education is now compulsory in India, and accompanied with mid-day meals, in most parts of the country run by the government. Pre-primary is not mandatory, however preferred. All government schools and affiliated private schools allow children who are 5 years of age as of 30 May to enroll to standard 1 of a primary school.

===Italy===
{{see also|Education in Italy}}
[[File:Nursery school classroom.jpg|thumb|Typical classroom layout in an [[:it:Asilo nido|Italian nursery school]]. From left to right: restroom, bathroom, playroom, and outdoor playground.]]

In [[Italy]], pre-school education refers to two different grades:
* Nursery schools, called ''{{lang|it|[[:it:Asilo nido|asili-nido]]}}'' for children between 3 and 36 months;
* [[:it:Scuola dell'infanzia|Maternal schools]] formerly ''{{lang|it|scuola materna}}'' and now ''{{lang|it|scuola dell'infanzia}}'', for children 3 to 5 years old.

Italian ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' were officially instituted in a 1971 State Law (L. 1044/1971), and may be ruled by either private or public institutions. They were originally established to allow mothers a chance to work out of their homes, and were therefore seen as a social service. Today, they mostly serve the purpose of general education and social interaction. In Italy, much effort has been spent on developing a pedagogical approach to children's care: well known is the so-called [[Reggio Emilia approach]], named after the city of Reggio Emilia, in [[Emilia-Romagna]].

''{{lang|it|Asili-nido}}'' normally occupy small one-story buildings, surrounded by gardens; usually suitable for no more than 60 or 70 children. The heart of the ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' are the classrooms, split into playroom and restroom; the playroom always has windows and doors leading to the outside playground and garden.

Maternal schools (''{{lang|it|scuola materna}}'') were established in 1968 after State Law n. 444 and are a full part of the official Italian education system, though attendance is not compulsory. Like ''{{lang|it|asili-nido}}'' (nursery schools), maternal schools may be held either by public or private institutions.

Early childhood education begins at home, and there are numerous books and television shows aimed at helping mothers &amp; fathers of preschool children to educate their children and to parent more effectively. Much of the home training is devoted to teaching manners, proper social behavior, and structured play, although verbal and number skills are also popular themes. Parents are strongly committed to early education and frequently enroll their children in preschools.
Kindergartens (幼稚園 yōchien), predominantly staffed by young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education but are not part of the official education system. The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at [[first grade]]. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.

===South Korea===
{{see also|Education in South Korea}}
In [[South Korea]], children normally attend kindergarten ({{lang-ko|유치원}} ''yuchi won'') between the ages of three or four and six or seven in the Western age system. (Korean ages are calculated differently from Western ages: when they are born they are considered one-year-olds, rather than one day old. Additionally, every January 1, everyone's age increases by one year regardless of when their birthday is. Hence in Korea, kindergarten children are called five-, six- and seven-year-olds.) The school year begins in March. It is followed by primary school. Normally the kindergartens are graded on a three-tier basis.

Korean kindergartens are private schools, and monthly costs vary. Korean parents often send their children to English kindergartens to give them a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in English. Such specialized kindergartens can be mostly taught in Korean with some English lessons, mostly taught in English with some Korean lessons, or completely taught in English. Almost all middle-class parents send their children to kindergarten.

Kindergarten programs in South Korea attempt to incorporate much academic instruction alongside more playful activities. Korean kindergartners learn to read, write (often in English as well as Korean) and do simple arithmetic. Classes are conducted in a traditional classroom setting, with the children focused on the teacher and one lesson or activity at a time. The goal of the teacher is to overcome weak points in each child's knowledge or skills.

Because the education system in Korea is very competitive, kindergartens are becoming more intensely academic. Children are pushed to read and write at a very young age. They also become accustomed to regular and considerable amounts of [[homework]]. These very young children may also attend other specialized afternoon schools, taking lessons in art, piano or violin, [[taekwondo]], ballet, soccer or mathematics.

===Kosovo===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
In [[Kosovo]], kindergarten is known as ''Çerdhe'' or ''Kopshti i fëmijëve'', and they serve as Day Care Centers. There are public and private kindergartens, and they are for children under the age of 3. Children between 3–6 years old go to ''Institucione parashkollore'', which are different from the Day Care Centers, because here children start the basic learning process, and they serve as preparatory institutions for the Primary School. After the age of 6, children continue in Primary School. However, neither the Day Care Centers nor the Preparatory Institutions are mandatory.

===Kuwait===
{{see also|Education in Kuwait}}
In [[Kuwait]], Kuwaiti children may go to free government kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) between the ages of four and six.

===Luxembourg===

In Luxembourg, a Kindergarten is called ''Spillschoul'' (literally "Playschool", plural ''Spillschoulen''). It is a public education facility which is attended by children between the age of 4 (or 5) and 6 when they advance to the ''Grondschoul'' (elementary school).

===Macedonia===
{{see also|Education in Macedonia}}
The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] equivalent of kindergarten is ''detska gradinka'' ({{lang|mk|детска градинка}}), sometimes called ''zabavishte'' ({{lang|mk|забавиште}}) when the kids are younger than 4 years. ''Detska gradinka'' is not part of the state's mandatory education, because the educational process in the country begins at the age of 5 or 6, i.e. first grade.

===Malaysia===
{{see also|Education in Malaysia}}
In [[Malaysia]], kindergarten is known as ''{{lang|zsm|tadika}}''. Most kindergartens are available to children of ages five and six (and some are available to children as young as four). For children up to the age of three (or four), there are [[pre-school playgroup]]s. There are no fixed rules for when a child needs to go to a kindergarten, but the majority will when the child turns 5 years old. The child will usually attend kindergarten for two years, before proceeding to [[primary school]] at age 7.&lt;ref name="Malaysia"&gt;[[Education in Malaysia#School grades|Education in Malaysia - School grades]], view Malaysian school grades here.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
{{see also|Education in Mexico}}
In [[Mexico]], kindergarten is called ''kínder'', with the last year sometimes referred to as ''preprimaria'' (''primaria'' is the name given to grades 1 through 6, so the name literally means "prior to elementary school"). The kindergarten system in Mexico was developed by professor [[Rosaura Zapata]], who received the country's highest honor for her contribution. It consists of three years of pre-school education, which are mandatory before elementary school. Previous nursery is optional and may be offered in either private schools or [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]].

At private schools, kinders usually consist of three grades, and a fourth one may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal. It goes before the other three years and is not obligatory. While the [[first grade]] is a [[pre-school playgroup|playgroup]], the other two are of classroom education.

In 2002, the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]] approved the ''Law of Obligatory Pre-schooling'', which made pre-school education for three to six-year-olds obligatory, and placed it under the auspices of the federal and state ministries of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.gob.mx/internacionales/assets/docs/relaciones_parlamentarias/america/foros/parla_latino/salud5.pdf Senado.gob.mx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012114537/http://www.senado.gob.mx/internacionales/assets/docs/relaciones_parlamentarias/america/foros/parla_latino/salud5.pdf |date=October 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/20/37423645.pdf OECD.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mongolia]], kindergarten is known as "цэцэрлэг" or ''tsetserleg''. As of September 2013, there are approximately 152 kindergartens registered in the country. From those 152 kindergartens, 142 are state owned. Children begin kindergarten at the age of 2 and finish it by 5. The education system before kindergarten in Mongolia is called "ясль", which accepts children between 0 and 2 years of age.

In [[Morocco]], pre-school is known as ''école maternelle'', ''kuttab'', or ''ar-rawd''. State-run, free ''maternelle'' schools are available throughout the kingdom, welcoming children aged from 2 to 5 (although in many places, children under 3 may not be granted a place). It is not compulsory, yet almost 80% of children aged 3 to 5 attend. It is regulated by the Moroccan department of education.

===Nepal===
{{see also|Education in Nepal}}
In [[Nepal]], kindergartens are run as private institutions, with their lessons conducted in English. The kindergarten education in Nepal is most similar to that of Hong Kong and India. Children start attending kindergarten from the age of 2 until they are at least 5 years old.

The kindergartens in Nepal have the following grades:
#Nursery/playgroup: 2- to 3-year-olds
#Lower Kindergarten: 3- to 4-year-olds
#Upper Kindergarten: 4- to 5-year-olds

===Netherlands===
{{see also|Education in Netherlands}}
In the [[Netherlands]], the equivalent term to kindergarten was ''{{lang|nl|kleuterschool}}''. From the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century the term ''{{lang|nl|Fröbelschool}}'' was also common, after [[Friedrich Fröbel]]. However, this term gradually faded in use as the verb ''{{lang|nl|Fröbelen}}'' gained a slightly derogatory meaning in everyday language. Until 1985, it used to be a separate non-compulsory form of education (for children aged 4–6 years), after which children (aged 6–12 years) attended the primary school (''lagere school''). After 1985, both forms were integrated into one, called ''{{lang|nl|basisonderwijs}}'' (Dutch for primary education). For children under 4, the country offers private, subsidized daycares (''{{lang|nl|kinderdagverblijf}}''), which are noncompulsory but nevertheless very popular.

=== New Zealand ===
{{See also|Education in New Zealand}}
In New Zealand, kindergarten can refer to education in the 2 years preceding primary school, from age 3 to 4. Primary Education starts at age 5. 

===Norway===
{{see also|Education in Norway}}
In [[Norway]], ''barnehage'' (children garden) is the term equivalent to kindergarten, used for children in the ages between 10 months and 6 years. The first ''barnehager'' were founded in Norway in the late 19th century. Although they have existed for 120 years, they are not considered part of the education system. They are both publicly and privately owned and operated. The staff, at minimum the manager, should be educated as ''barnehagelærer'' (kindergarten teacher), previously known as ''førskolelærer'' (pre-school teachers). The children spend most of the time outdoors. There is also an institution called ''barnepark'' (children's park), which does not need to have certified staff.

===Peru===
{{see also|Education in Peru}}
In [[Peru]], the term ''nido'' refers to the schooling children attend from 3 to 6 years of age. It is followed by primary school classes, which last for six years. Some families choose to send their children to primary school at the age of 6. In 1902 the teacher Elvira Garcia and Garcia co-founder of the Society cited above, organized the first kindergarten for children 2 to 8 years old, Fanning annex to the Lyceum for ladies. Her studies and concern for children led her to spread through conferences and numerous documents, the importance of protecting children early and to respond to the formation of a personality based on justice and understanding, as well as the use of methods Fröbel and from Montessori and participation of parents in this educational task.

===Philippines===
{{see also|Education in the Philippines}}
In the [[Philippines]], education officially starts at the Elementary level and placing children into early childhood education through kindergarten is optional to parents. Early childhood education in the Philippines is classified into:
* '''Center-based programs''', such as the [[Barangay]] daycare service, public and private pre-schools, kindergarten or school-based programs, community or church-based early childhood education programs initiated by nongovernment organizations or people's organizations, workplace-related child care and education programs, child-minding centers, health centers and stations; and
* '''Home-based programs''', such as the neighborhood-based playgroups, family day care programs, parent education and home visiting programs.

Early childhood education was strengthened through the creation of the Early Childhood Care and Development Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2000/ra_8980_2000.html|title=R.A. 8980|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Department of Education disseminated copies of the Kindergarten Education Act through Republic Act No. 10157 making it compulsory and mandatory in the entire nation. As a provision in this law, children under five years old are required to enroll in a kindergarten in any public elementary school in the country. This goes with the implementation of the K-12 system in the Basic Education Curriculum.

===Romania===

{{see also|Education in Romania}}
In [[Romania]], ''{{lang|ro|grădiniţă}}'', which means "little garden", is the favored form of education for preschool children usually aged 3–6. The children are divided in three groups: "little group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mică}}'', age 3–4), "medium group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mijlocie}}'', age 4-5) and "big group" (''{{lang|ro|grupa mare}}'', age 5-6). In the last few years, private kindergartens have become popular, supplementing the state preschool education system. Kindergarten is optional. The "preparatory school year" (''clasa pregătitoare'') is for children aged 6–7, and since it became compulsory in 2012,&lt;ref name="Mediafax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/social/clasa-pregatitoare-obligatorie-din-septembrie-ce-vor-invata-copiii-si-cum-vor-fi-evaluati-9167096 |title=Clasa pregătitoare, obligatorie din septembrie.

[[File:Detsad Leningrad 1930s.jpg|thumb|Detsad 1920s|Children of a kindergarten on a walk, Leningrad, Russia, 1930s]]
In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], {{lang|ru|Детский сад}} (''dyetskiy sad'', literal translation of "children's garden") is a preschool educational institution for children, usually 3 to 6 years of age.

===South Africa===
{{see also|Education in South Africa}}
Kindergartens (commonly known as creche) in [[South Africa]] provide from 0-6 years of age spent of preschool programs for children of all ages up to six. The one to three-year program, known as ''nursery'', ''kindergarten 1'' (K1), and ''kindergarten 2'' (K2), prepares children for their first year in primary school education. Some kindergartens further divide nursery into N1 and N2.

===Spain===
In Spain, kindergarten is called ''{{lang|es|infantil}}'', ''{{lang|es|ciclo infantil}}'' or ''{{lang|es|guardería}}'', and serves children from 3 to 6 years of age. It's commonly known by some people as ''{{lang|es|parvulitos}}''.

1º ciclo de Educación Infantil (from 0 to 3 years of age)
2º ciclo de Educación Infantil (from 3 to 6 years of age).

===Sudan===

Kindergarten in Sudan is divided into private and public kindergarten. Preschool is compulsory in Sudan. The proper kindergarten age spans from 3–6 years. The curriculum covers Arabic, English, religion, mathematics and more.

===Sweden===
{{see also|Education in Sweden}}
In [[Sweden]], kindergarten activities were established in the 19th century, and have been widely expanded since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="LeesLees2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Lees|author2=Lynn Hollen Lees|title=Cities and the Making of Modern Europe, 1750-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1V8-EdwtO8C&amp;pg=PA177|date=December 13, 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83936-5|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="froebelweb.org"/&gt; The first Swedish kindergarten teachers were trained by [[Henriette Schrader-Breymann]] at the [[Pestalozzi-Fröbel Haus]], which she founded in 1882.&lt;ref name="LeesLees2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="froebelweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froebelweb.org/images/niece.html|title=Henriette Schrader-Breymann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
{{see also|Education in Taiwan}}
While many public kindergartens and preschools exist in [[Taiwan]], private kindergartens and preschools are also quite popular. Many private preschools offer accelerated courses in various subjects to compete with public preschools and capitalize on public demand for academic achievement. Curriculum at such preschools often encompasses subject material such as science, art, physical education and even mathematics classes. The majority of these schools are part of large school chains, which operate under franchise arrangements. In return for annual fees, the chain enterprises may supply advertising, curriculum, books, materials, training, and even staff for each individual school.

There has been a huge growth in the number of privately owned and operated English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an "English only" environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local children should be placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English Immersion Preschools continues to grow.

===Ukraine===

In 2010, a total of 56% of children aged one to six years old had the opportunity to attend [[preschool education]], the Education and Science Ministry of Ukraine reported in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/78029/ Education Ministry: Some 44 percent of children unable to attend kindergarten], [[Kyiv Post]] (August 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Many preschools and kindergartens were closed previously in light of [[Economy of Ukraine|economic]] and [[Demographics of Ukraine|demographic]] considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Avq58dqJwMkC&amp;pg=PA1226&amp;dq=kindergarten+Ukraine&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=7PFuTOHXFYGRjAem-pD8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGYQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=kindergarten%20Ukraine&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Motherhood] by [[Andrea O'Reilly]], [[Sage Publications, Inc]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6846-1}} (page 1226)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|Education in the United Kingdom}}
&lt;!-- The opening paragraph covers both nursery and reception/first year(s) of primary education, because "kindergarten" is used in either sense in other English-speaking countries. --&gt;
The term kindergarten is rarely used in the UK to describe modern pre-school education or the first year(s) of compulsory primary school education. Pre-schools are usually known as creche, nursery schools or [[pre-school playgroup|playgroups]], while the first year of compulsory schooling is known as [[Reception (school)|Reception]] in England, ''Dosbarth Derbyn'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ("reception class") and Primary One in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Nursery forms part of the [[Foundation Stage]] of education. In the 1980s, England and [[Wales]] officially adopted the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] system whereby children start school either in the term or year in which they will become five depending on the policy of the [[local education authority]]. In Scotland, schooling becomes compulsory between the ages of 4½ and 5½ years, depending on their birthday (school starts in August for children who were 4 by the end of the preceding February).

However, the word "kindergarten" is used for more specialist organisations such as [[forest kindergarten]]s and is sometimes used in the naming of private nurseries that provide full-day child care for working parents. Historically the word was used during the nineteenth century when activists like [[Adelaide Manning]] were introducing educators to the work of [[Friedrich Fröbel]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Sutherland, ‘Manning, (Elizabeth) Adelaide (1828–1905)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48424, accessed 26 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, parents have the option of nursery for their children at the ages of three or four years, before compulsory education begins. Before that, less structured childcare is available privately. The details vary between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Some nurseries are attached to state [[infant school|infant]] or primary schools, but many are provided by the private sector. The Scottish government provides funding&lt;ref name="scottish-state-funding"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt; so that all children from the age of three until they start compulsory school can attend five sessions per week of two and a half hours each, either in state-run or private nurseries. Working parents can also receive from their employers childcare worth £55 per week free of income tax,&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt; which is typically enough to pay for one or two days per week.

The Scottish Government defines its requirements for nursery schools in the Early Years Framework&lt;ref name="earlyyears"&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf Early Years Framework], Scottish Government, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the Curriculum for Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/curriculumforexcellence/index.asp Ltscotland.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801110701/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/curriculumforexcellence/index.asp |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each school interprets these with more or less independence (depending on their [[Educational management|management]] structure) but must satisfy the Care Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carecommission.com|title=Care Commission|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322080915/http://www.carecommission.com/|archivedate=March 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to retain their licence to operate.

* confident individuals

===United States===
{{see also|Education in the United States}}
[[File:1921 Locust yearbook p. 100 (Kindergarten).jpg|thumb|1921 kindergarten class at the [[East Texas State Normal College]] Training School]]
In the US, kindergarten is usually part of the [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] educational system. In most state and private schools, children begin kindergarten at age 5 and attend for one year. They do activities such as [[addition]] (+), [[subtraction]] (-), and playing outside on the [[playground]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecs.org/clearinghouse/86/62/8662.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-three states require their school districts to offer a kindergarten year.&lt;ref name="nces53"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kindergarten requirements, by state: 2010 |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/statereform/tab5_3.asp|work=Table 5.3|publisher=[[National Center for Education Statistics]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical US kindergarten [[classroom]], resources like [[toy]]s, [[picture book]]s, and [[crayon]]s are available for children's use. The daily schedule varies from town to town, but there are some similarities.  In the [[morning]], the children usually do [[circle time]]. This includes saying the [[pledge of allegiance]], looking at the [[calendar]], and discussing the [[weather]] and [[season]] that day. Next, the children work on different subjects:

In [[math]], kindergartners usually do single digit [[addition]] and [[subtraction]], learn to count with "more or less" games, become acquainted with a [[clock]], and learn [[skip counting]] to prepare them for one digit [[multiplication]]. 

In [[language arts]] (English), children learn [[sight word]]s, (cat, fun), [[rhyming]], blends, and silent e. They then learn how to write, form sentences, and are required to write three complete sentences by the end of the year.

In [[social studies]], kindergartners learn about the [[month]]s, [[U.S. state]]s, the [[continent]]s, and sometimes about people performing community functions (e.g. [[Physician|doctor]], [[barber]], [[teacher]]) and places (e.g."You go to a [[hospital]] when you're sick or to have [[surgery]]." "You go to a [[park]] to [[play (activity)|play]].")

After a few lessons, there is a break for [[lunch]]. Children either fetch their own [[Lunch box|lunchboxes]] brought from home or get a lunch from the [[cafeteria]] and eat it (or take) there or in the classroom. Sometimes after lunch the children have [[recess (break)|recess]], some students' favorite part of the day, when they can go outside to [[Play (activity)|play]] on [[swing (seat)|swings]], [[playground slide|slides]],  play [[ basketball]], or socialize. After recess kindergartners go back inside to do more learning. Some schools let children take a nap or do free choice (blocks, [[tic tac toe]], [[play doh]], etc.)
When kindergarten is over for the day, parents or guardians come to pick up their child or the children ride a bus home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12332">'''''Last in First Out''''' (LIFO) (or otherwise known as "Last One Hired is the First One Fired" is a policy often used by school districts and other employers to prioritize [[layoff]]s by [[seniority]].  Under LIFO layoff rules, junior teachers and other employees lose their jobs before senior ones.  Laying off junior employees first is not exclusive to the education sector or to the United States, but is perhaps most controversial there.  LIFO's proponents claim that it protects teachers with [[tenure]] and gives them job stability, and that it is an easily administered way of accomplishing layoffs following a budget cut.  LIFO's critics respond that it is bad for students. They prefer that the best teachers remain regardless of how long they have been teaching.

LIFO and tenure were originally intended to provide college [[professor|professors]] with [[academic freedom]] and ensure that they could research topics of their own choosing. In the K-12 sector, tenure was introduced to lower high teacher turnover rates. In 1932, over 20% of teachers were dismissed due to personal disagreements and difference of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Butsch, R. (1937). Tenure of teachers. Teacher Personnel, 7(3), 292-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, LIFO was criticized on grounds that "seniority based layoffs result in promising, inexperienced teachers losing their positions, while their less effective, but more senior, peers continue to teach."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. J., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., &amp; Wyckoff, J. H. (2010). Teacher layoffs: An empirical illustration of seniority vs. measures of effectiveness. brief 12.National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/864940729&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2014, 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered when deciding which teachers to layoff, 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion, 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors, and 10 states provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v.

== Effects of seniority-prioritized layoffs ==

LIFO has a more severe impact in poor or high minority schools, since those schools tend to have newer and less experienced teachers. In schools where 34% or less of the students receive [[Reduced price meal|Free and Reduced meals]], more than 82% of teachers have 4 or more years of experience. However, in schools where more than 75% of the student body receives Free and Reduced meals,  only 77% of the teachers have more than 4 years of experience.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, "Public School Teacher, BIE School Teacher, and Private School Teacher Data Files," 2007-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in California, it was seen that in schools in the lowest quartile of minority students, only 8 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching whereas in schools with the highest [[quartile]] of minority students, 13 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching, meaning that under LIFO-based layoffs, schools with larger minority populations would lose 60% more teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Sepe, Cristina, and Marguerite Roza. The Disproportionate Impact of Seniority Based Layoffs on Poor, Minority Students. Rep. Seattle: Center on Reinventing Public Education, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, teachers in high need areas, such as secondary math and special education, are often less experienced due to the difficulty of recruiting these positions, and districts who adhere strictly to seniority based systems for layoffs face the added burden of recruiting teachers in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell.&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, it was noted that of the hundreds of promising new teachers cut in from the district in 2010 due to LIFO, 190 were in the top fifth overall of teachers in raising math and reading scores.&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason; Song, Jason; and Smith, Doug (2010). "When layoffs come to L.A. schools, performance doesn't count." Los Angeles Times, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the effectiveness of teachers does not change after the first few years in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]] and Steven G. Rivkin, "The Distribution of Teacher Quality and Implications for Policy." Annual Review of Economics 4 (2012): 7.1-7.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the implications of using LIFO rules for layoffs instead of basing layoffs on classroom effectiveness appear huge.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). "Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs." Center for Education Data &amp; Research, University of Washington-Bothell; Steven Glazerman, Susanna Loeb, Dan Goldhaber, Douglas Staiger, Stephen Raudenbush, and Grover Whitehurst, ''Evaluating Teachers: The Important Role of Value-Added'' (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2010); Donald Boyd, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and James Wyckoff, "Teacher Layoffs: An Empirical Illustration of Seniority versus Measures of Effectiveness." ''Education Finance and Policy'' 6, no. 3 (Summer 2011): 439-454.&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=November 2015}}  With LIFO, more teachers must be dismissed to meet budgetary targets than with effectiveness-based layoffs because the youngest teachers are the least paid, but the teachers dismissed under the LIFO policy are only slightly below average in effectiveness.  An effectiveness-based policy on the other hand leads to dramatic improvements in average teacher quality, and these improvements have lasting effects on students throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]], "Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?"

==LIFO and value-added economic modeling==
{{POV-section|date=July 2017}}
In many states, tenure is given to teachers after 3 years, without much indication of job performance. A [[Value-added modeling|value added model]] (VAM) could be used in tenure decisions for teachers in order to estimate teacher quality. A VAM would predict how well a teacher would do based on his or her previous experience teaching. Data shows that the VAM based on standardized test scores, is a better indicator of teacher performance than any observable attributes. 
&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, Dan, &amp; Hansen, M. (2010). Using performance on the job to inform teacher tenure decisions. The American Economic Review, 100(2), 250-250-255. {{doi|10.1257/aer.100.2.250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In using a VAM to evaluate teachers for a tenure decision, school districts can ensure that the teachers they retain (and the teachers who in turn become the most senior) are effective educators, thereby eliminating some of the discrepancy between LIFO and performance-based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, D. (2003). Evaluating value-added models for teacher accountability. Santa Monica: Rand Publishing.Retrieved from https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG158.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and the overhaul of LIFO ==

Since less experienced teachers typically have lower salaries, it is estimated that if districts in the [[United States]] cut 5% of their budget through seniority based layoffs, approximately 79,000 more teachers would lose their jobs versus seniority neutral layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs. Publication. The New Teacher Project, Feb. 2011. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://tntp.org/files/TNTP_Case_Against_Quality_Blind_Layoffs_Feb2011.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of New York State parents regarding teacher quality versus seniority,  voters said they did not care how long a teacher had taught so long as the teacher was effective and produced good results.&lt;ref&gt;New York voters oppose "last-in, first-out" for teacher layoffs - NYPOST.com. (n.d.). . Retrieved April 24, 2011, from http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/voters_ax_the_worst_X4kKxTM7P75e9enFpDuTkI&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with Arizona in 2009, certain states and districts have been passing laws which prohibit seniority from being the deciding factor in layoff decisions. Maine, Louisiana, and District of Columbia use multiple criteria in determining layoffs, and numerous other states are trending towards performance based over seniority based layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Teacher Layoffs: Rethinking "Last-Hired, First Fired" Policies.

[[Michelle Rhee]], the former Chancellor of Washington, D.C. public schools, opposes the Last in First Out policy, instead suggesting performance based evaluation to determine layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;End "last in, first out" teacher layoffs - CNN.com. (n.d.). . Retrieved May 2, 2011, from http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/23/rhee.layoff.policy/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  As Chancellor, she introduced the [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/impact IMPACT] evaluation for teachers, which measured teacher performance and was the primary factor for layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs.

Victories from this campaign have been seen in Florida, Utah, Michigan, Nevada and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;"Save Great Teachers." Save Great Teachers- Studentsfirst.org. Web. 10 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://www.studentsfirst.org/lifo&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 court case of ''[[Vergara v. California]]'' struck down California's LIFO layoff rules as having a disproportionately negative impact on poor and minority public school students, thus violating the California Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Judgment | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = August 27, 2014 |pinpoint = page 3, lines 19-27 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Vergara'' trial judge noted that teacher layoffs prioritized solely by seniority prevented senior and ineffective teachers from being laid off before junior but effective teachers.  In this situation, "[n]o matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one . . . is separated from [the students] and a senior grossly ineffective one . . . is left in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 19-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge concluded that "[t]he logic of [this scheme] is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 4-5 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ACPP road.jpg|thumb|The learning alliance Academic Cooperation Palestine Project (ACPP) hosts research partnerships around sensitive issues related to the Israeli Separation Wall.]]

A '''learning alliance''' is a diverse network of individuals committed to improving knowledge on a specific research topic.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, M. 2004. Learning alliances with development partners: a framework for out scaling research results. In: Pachico, D. (ed.) Scaling Up and Out: Achieving Widespread Impact Through Agricultural Research. Cali, Colombia: International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)&lt;/ref&gt; Learning alliances are often made up of small networks of public, private and/or civil society actors seeking to further social or political change.

==Learning alliance structure==

Learning alliances consist of a series of facilitated meetings or informal exchanges between [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] with a common advocacy interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningalliance.ch/LearningAllianceWallMonitoring.html|title=Learning Alliance Wall Monitoring|work=learningalliance.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual actors or groups share knowledge on a topic in order to improve the validity, accuracy and dissemination of their analysis.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lundy, Mark; Gottret, Maria Veronica (2006). Learning Alliances: An approach for Building Multi-stakeholder Innovation Systems in Smits, S.J., P.B. Moriarty and Sijbesma, C. (eds.) (2007) Learning Alliances: Scaling up innovations in water, sanitation and hygiene sector. Delft, the Netherlands, IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre (Technical Paper Series No 47). p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the humanitarian sector==

Learning Alliances in the humanitarian sector often place importance on improving the capacity of disadvantaged social groups to solve problems on their own behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, Mark, Maria Verónica Gottret, and Jacqueline Ashby. 2005. "Learning Alliances: An Approach for Building Multi-Stakeholder Innovation Systems," ILAC Brief, no. 8 (2005). P.2&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lundy, M. 2004. Learning alliances with development partners: a framework for out scaling research results. In: Pachico, D. (ed.) Scaling Up and Out: Achieving Widespread Impact Through Agricultural Research. Cali, Colombia: International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).&lt;/ref&gt; The learning alliance concept has ties to the field of [[Participatory Action Research]], or PAR, an approach to social research that emphasizes participation and action by community members.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, R. L. (2007). The Relationship of "Systems Thinking" to Action Research. In P. R. al., Handbook of Action Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[humanitarian]], [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[social research]] fields, the term Learning Alliance has been used by international aid groups to describe cross-boundary [[stakeholder networks]] focused on improving local civil society capacity.&lt;ref&gt;LearningAlliance.ch. 2014. Web resource.  http://learningalliance.ch/LearningAllianceWallMonitoring.html. Accessed April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic literature==
The Learning Alliance approach was first discussed in literature in 1994 investigating what [[Michael Gibbons (sociologist)|Michael Gibbons]] called [[mode two]] knowledge production.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges; Helga Nowotny; Simon Schwartzman; Peter Scott; Martin Trow (1994). The new production of knowledge: the dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies. London: Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Mode two knowledge production involves multidisciplinary teams that work together on specific problems in the real world, in contrast to mode one knowledge production, “which is motivated by scientific knowledge alone... and which is not bothered by the applicability of its findings”.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Gibbons]] noted that this type of research “promotes the interaction of multiple actors with multi-layered sources of knowledge to cope with the complexity of fostering continuous technological, social and institutional innovations to respond to rapidly changing contexts and demands”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Examples of learning alliances ==
In 2012 the United Nations Barrier Monitoring Unit (BMU) launched a formal Learning Alliance called the Academic Cooperation Palestine Project (ACPP) to enhance the educational and technical capacity of Palestinian researchers.  &lt;ref&gt;Golay, Francois et al. ‘Academic Cooperation to Foster Research and Advocacy Competences in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (West Bank). In Bolay Jean-Claude (eds.) Technologies for Sustainable Development. Springer: Cham, Switzerland, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ACPP hosted local and international research partnerships around sensitive issues related to the Israeli Separation Wall, including land degradation, water rights and land title controls.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Relief and Works Agency. 2012. Barrier Monitoring Unit. Online Resource. http://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/2012061311624.pdf . Accessed April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ACPP is now called the WALL Learning Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Monitoring. The WALL Learning Alliance. Online Resource. http://learningalliance.ch/LearningAllianceWallMonitoring.html Accessed April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Digital Learning Alliance group formed to “improve economic growth in underserved areas of the U.S. by advocating for personalized education through the use of digital learning technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitallearningalliance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Learning Alliance, started in 2009 in the United States, was organized to further literacy among school children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelearningalliance.org/get-to-know-tla/history|title=Our History - The Learning Alliance|website=www.thelearningalliance.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In Indian River County, Florida, the Alliance worked with parents, community leaders, educators, and concerned citizens to achieve 90 percent literacy by third grade by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/story/specialty-publications/vero-beach/2017/11/22/literacy-project-gaining-national-attention-its-success-county-school-children/870331001/|title=Literacy project gaining national attention for its success with county school children|work=TCPalm|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, through professional development opportunities, book drives, and after school and summer programs, literacy had increased to 56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/story/specialty-publications/vero-beach/2017/11/22/literacy-project-gaining-national-attention-its-success-county-school-children/870331001/|title=Literacy project gaining national attention for its success with county school children|work=TCPalm|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a learning alliance structure, the group meets monthly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28070">'''Learning analytics''' is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs.&lt;ref name="LAK11 Call"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics | title=Call for Papers of the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge (LAK 2011) | accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related field is [[educational data mining]].

==Definition==
The definition and aims of learning analytics are contested. One earlier definition discussed by the community suggested that
"Learning analytics is the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections for predicting and advising people's learning."&lt;ref name="Siemens LA Def"&gt;Siemens, George. "What Are Learning Analytics?" Elearnspace, August 25, 2010. http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2010/08/25/what-are-learning-analytics/&lt;/ref&gt; But this definition has been criticised by [[George Siemens]]&lt;ref&gt;"I somewhat disagree with this definition—it serves well as an introductory concept if we use analytics as a support structure for existing education models. I think learning analytics—at an advanced and integrated implementation—can do away with pre-fab curriculum models." [http://groups.google.com.au/group/learninganalytics/msg/1b2ee789be37beb1 George Siemens in the Learning Analytics Google Group discussion, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} and Mike Sharkey.&lt;ref&gt;"In the descriptions of learning analytics we talk about using data to "predict success". I've struggled with that as I pore over our databases. I've come to realize there are different views/levels of success." [http://groups.google.com.au/group/learninganalytics/msg/3688c9b335e47240 Mike Sharkey, Director of Academic Analytics, University of Phoenix, in the Learning Analytics Google Group discussion, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}}

A more holistic view than a mere definition is provided by the framework of learning analytics by Greller and Drachsler (2012).&lt;ref name="Greller and Drachsler"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/15_3/4.pdf |format=pdf |title=Translating Learning into Numbers: Toward a Generic Framework for Learning Analytics. |last=Greller |first=Wolfgang |last2=Drachsler |first2=Hendrik |journal=Educational Technology and Society |date=2012 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=42–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a general morphological analysis (GMA) to divide the domain into six "critical dimensions".

A systematic overview on learning analytics and its key concepts is provided by Chatti et al. (2012)&lt;ref name="A Refence Model for Learning Analytics"&gt;Mohamed Amine Chatti, Anna Lea Dyckhoff, Ulrik Schroeder and Hendrik Thüs (2012). A reference model for learning analytics. International Journal of Technology Enhanced Learning (IJTEL), 4(5/6), pp. 318-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chatti et al. (2014)&lt;ref name="LA Challenges and Directions"&gt;Chatti, M. A., Lukarov, V., Thüs, H., Muslim, A., Yousef, A. M. F., Wahid, U., Greven, C., Chakrabarti, A., Schroeder, U. (2014). Learning Analytics: Challenges and Future Research Directions. eleed, Iss. 10. http://eleed.campussource.de/archive/10/4035&lt;/ref&gt; through a reference model for learning analytics based on four dimensions, namely data, environments, context (what?), stakeholders (who?), objectives (why?), and methods (how?).

It has been pointed out{{By whom|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picciano|first=Anthony G.|date=2012|title=The Evolution of Big Data and Learning Analytics in American Higher Education.|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eric/docview/1238188091/AC784AD901ED497EPQ/10?accountid=14496|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=16|pages=9-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a broad awareness of analytics across educational institutions for various stakeholders, but that the way learning analytics is defined and implemented may vary, including:
# for individual learners to reflect on their achievements and patterns of behaviour in relation to others; 
# as predictors of students requiring extra support and attention; 
# to help teachers and support staff plan supporting interventions with individuals and groups;
# for functional groups such as course teams seeking to improve current courses or develop new curriculum offerings; and
# for institutional administrators taking decisions on matters such as marketing and recruitment or efficiency and effectiveness measures.&lt;ref name="Institutional Readiness"&gt;Powell, Stephen, and Sheila MacNeill. Institutional Readiness for Analytics A Briefing Paper. CETIS Analytics Series. JISC CETIS, December 2012. {{cite web |url=http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Institutional-Readiness-for-Analytics-Vol1-No8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502234323/http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Institutional-Readiness-for-Analytics-Vol1-No8.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In that briefing paper, Powell and MacNeill go on to point out that some motivations and implementations of analytics may come into conflict with others, for example highlighting potential conflict between analytics for individual learners and organisational stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Institutional Readiness" /&gt;

[[Dragan Gasevic | Gašević]], Dawson, and [[George Siemens | Siemens]] argue that computational aspects of learning analytics need to be linked with the existing educational research if the field of learning analytics is to deliver to its promise to understand and optimize learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gašević | first1 = D. | last2 = Dawson | first2 = S. | last3 = Siemens | first3 = G. | year = 2015 | title = Let's not forget: Learning analytics are about learning | url = https://www.sfu.ca/~dgasevic/papers_shared/techtrends2015.pdf| journal = TechTrends | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 64–71 | doi = 10.1007/s11528-014-0822-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiating learning analytics and educational data mining==
Differentiating the fields of [[educational data mining]] (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) has been a concern of several researchers. [[George Siemens]] takes the position that educational data mining encompasses both learning analytics and [[academic analytics]],&lt;ref name="open_learning_analytics"&gt;G. Siemens, D. Gasevic, C. Haythornthwaite, S. Dawson, S. B. Shum, R. Ferguson, E. Duval, K. Verbert, and R. S. J. D. Baker. Open Learning Analytics: an integrated &amp; modularized platform. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the former of which is aimed at governments, funding agencies, and administrators instead of learners and faculty. Baepler and Murdoch define [[academic analytics]] as an area that "...combines select institutional data, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to create intelligence upon which learners, instructors, or administrators can change academic behavior".&lt;ref name="academic_analytics"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baepler | first1 = P. | last2 = Murdoch | first2 = C. J. | title = Academic Analytics and Data Mining in Higher Education | url = | journal = International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning | volume = 4 | issue = 2| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to attempt to disambiguate educational data mining from academic analytics based on whether the process is hypothesis driven or not, though Brooks&lt;ref name="a_data-assisted"&gt;C. Brooks. A Data-Assisted Approach to Supporting Instructional Interventions in Technology Enhanced Learning Environments. PhD Dissertation. University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; questions whether this distinction exists in the literature. Brooks&lt;ref name="a_data-assisted"/&gt; instead proposes that a better distinction between the EDM and LA communities is in the roots of where each community originated, with authorship at the EDM community being dominated by researchers coming from intelligent tutoring paradigms, and learning anaytics researchers being more focused on enterprise learning systems (e.g. learning content management systems).

Regardless of the differences between the LA and EDM communities, the two areas have significant overlap both in the objectives of investigators as well as in the methods and techniques that are used in the investigation. In the [[Master of Science|MS]] program offering in learning analytics at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers]] [[Teachers College, Columbia University|College]], Columbia University, students are taught both EDM and LA methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Analytics {{!}} Teachers College Columbia University|url = http://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/learning-analytics/|website = www.tc.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The context of learning analytics===
In "The State of Learning Analytics in 2012: A Review and Future Challenges" Rebecca Ferguson&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson, Rebecca. ''The State of Learning Analytics in 2012: A Review and Future Challenges''. Technical Report. Knowledge Media Institute: The Open University, UK, 2012. http://kmi.open.ac.uk/publications/pdf/kmi-12-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; tracks the progress of analytics for learning as a development through:{{efn|This section is adapted from the EdFutures.net wiki ([[CC-By-SA]])}}
# The increasing interest in [[big data]] for [[business intelligence]]
# The rise of [[online education]] focussed around [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs), [[content management system]]s (CMSs), and [[management information systems]] (MIS) for education, which saw an increase in digital data regarding student background (often held in the MIS) and learning log data (from VLEs). This development afforded the opportunity to apply [[business intelligence]] techniques to educational data
# Questions regarding the optimisation of systems to support learning particularly given the question regarding how we can know whether a student is engaged/understanding if we can't see them?
# Increasing focus on evidencing progress and professional standards for accountability systems
# This focus led to a teacher stake in the analytics—given that they are associated with accountability systems
# Thus an increasing emphasis was placed on the pedagogic affordances of learning analytics
# This pressure is increased by the economic desire to improve engagement in [[online education]] for the deliverance of high-quality affordable education

===History of techniques and methods of learning analytics===
In a discussion of the history of analytics, Cooper&lt;ref name="Brief History Analytics"&gt;Cooper, Adam. A Brief History of Analytics A Briefing Paper. CETIS Analytics Series. JISC CETIS, November 2012. http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Analytics-Brief-History-Vol-1-No9.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; highlights a number of communities from which learning analytics draws techniques, including:
# [[Statistics]], which are a well established means to address hypothesis testing.
# [[Business intelligence]], which has similarities with learning analytics, although it has historically been targeted at making the production of reports more efficient through enabling data access and summarising performance indicators.
# [[Web analytics]], tools such as [[Google analytics]] report on web page visits and references to websites, brands and other keyterms across the internet. The more "fine grain" of these techniques can be adopted in learning analytics for the exploration of student trajectories through learning resources (courses, materials, etc.). 
# [[Operational research]], which aims at highlighting design optimisation for maximising objectives through the use of mathematical models and statistical methods. Such techniques are implicated in learning analytics which seek to create models of real world behaviour for practical application.
# [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[Data mining]], machine learning techniques built on data mining and AI methods are capable of detecting patterns in data. In learning analytics such techniques can be used for [[intelligent tutoring system]]s, classification of students in more dynamic ways than simple demographic factors, and resources such as "suggested course" systems modelled on [[collaborative filtering]] techniques.
# [[Social network analysis]] (SNA), which analyses relationships between people by exploring implicit (e.g. interactions on forums) and explicit (e.g. "friends" or "followers") ties online and offline. SNA developed from the work of sociologists like Wellman and Watts, and mathematicians like Barabasi and Strogatz. The work of these individuals has provided us with a good sense of the patterns that networks exhibit (small world, power laws), the attributes of connections (in early 70's, Granovetter explored connections from a perspective of tie strength and impact on new information), and the social dimensions of networks (for example, geography still matters in a digital networked world). It is particularly used to explore clusters of networks, influence networks, engagement and disengagement, and has been deployed for these purposes in learning analytic contexts.

=== History of learning analytics in higher education ===
The first graduate program focused specifically on learning analytics was created by [[Ryan S. Baker]] and launched in the Fall 2015 semester at Teachers College, Columbia University. The program description states that
{{Quote|data about learning and learners are being generated today on an unprecedented scale. The fields of learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) have emerged with the aim of transforming this data into new insights that can benefit students, teachers, and administrators. As one of world's leading teaching and research institutions in education, psychology, and health, we are proud to offer an innovative graduate curriculum dedicated to improving education through technology and data analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Analytics|url = http://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/learning-analytics/|website = www.tc.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Analytic methods==
Methods for learning analytics include:
* Content analysis, particularly of resources which students create (such as essays).
* Discourse analytics, which aims to capture meaningful data on student interactions which (unlike social network analytics) aims to explore the properties of the language used, as opposed to just the network of interactions, or forum-post counts, etc.
* Social learning analytics, which is aimed at exploring the role of social interaction in learning, the importance of learning networks, discourse used to sensemake, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham Shum, S. and Ferguson, R., Social Learning Analytics. Educational Technology &amp; Society (Special Issue on Learning &amp; Knowledge Analytics, Eds. G. Siemens &amp; D. Gašević), 15, 3, (2012), 3-26. http://www.ifets.info Open Access Eprint: http://oro.open.ac.uk/34092&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disposition analytics, which seeks to capture data regarding student's dispositions to their own learning, and the relationship of these to their learning.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, M., Learning Analytics: Moving from Concept to Practice. EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative Briefing, 2012. http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/learning-analytics-moving-concept-practice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckingam Shum Crick Dispositions"&gt;Buckingham Shum, S. and Deakin Crick, R., Learning Dispositions and Transferable Competencies: Pedagogy, Modelling and Learning Analytics. In: Proc. 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge (Vancouver, 29 Apr-2 May 2012). ACM: New York. pp.92-101. {{DOI|10.1145/2330601.2330629}} Eprint: http://oro.open.ac.uk/32823&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "curious" learners may be more inclined to ask questions, and this data can be captured and analysed for learning analytics.

==Analytic outcomes==
Analytics have been used for:
* [[Prediction]] purposes, for example to identify "at risk" students in terms of drop out or course failure
* [[Personalization]] &amp; [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]], to provide students with tailored learning pathways, or assessment materials
* Intervention purposes, providing educators with information to intervene to support students
* [[Information visualization]], typically in the form of so-called learning dashboards which provide overview learning data through data visualisation tools

==Software==
{{See also|Social network analysis software|Student information system}}
Much of the software that is currently used for learning analytics duplicates functionality of web analytics software, but applies it to learner interactions with content. Social network analysis tools are commonly used to map social connections and discussions. Some examples of learning analytics software tools include:

==Ethics and privacy==
The ethics of data collection, analytics, reporting and accountability has been raised as a potential concern for learning analytics,&lt;ref name="Greller and Drachsler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade, Sharon and Prinsloo, Paul "Learning analytics: ethical issues and dilemmas" in American Behavioral Scientist (2013), 57(10), pp. 1509-1528. http://oro.open.ac.uk/36594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, G. "Learning Analytics: Envisioning a Research Discipline and a Domain of Practice." In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, 4–8, 2012. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2330605.&lt;/ref&gt; with concerns raised regarding:
* Data ownership&lt;ref&gt;Kristy Kitto, Towards a Manifesto for Data Ownership http://www.laceproject.eu/blog/towards-a-manifesto-for-data-ownership/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communications around the scope and role of learning analytics
* The necessary role of human feedback and error-correction in learning analytics systems 
* Data sharing between systems, organisations, and stakeholders
* Trust in data clients

As Kay, Kom and Oppenheim point out, the range of data is wide, potentially derived from:&lt;ref name="Legal Risk Ethical"&gt;Kay, David, Naomi Kom, and Charles Oppenheim. Legal, Risk and Ethical Aspects of Analytics in Higher Education. Analytics Series. Accessed January 3, 2013. {{cite web |url=http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Legal-Risk-and-Ethical-Aspects-of-Analytics-in-Higher-Education-Vol1-No6.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502234313/http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Legal-Risk-and-Ethical-Aspects-of-Analytics-in-Higher-Education-Vol1-No6.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recorded activity: student records, attendance, assignments, researcher information (CRIS)
* Systems interactions: VLE, library / repository search, card transactions
* Feedback mechanisms: surveys, customer care
* External systems that offer reliable identification such as sector and shared services and social networks

Thus the legal and ethical situation is challenging and different from country to country, raising implications for:&lt;ref name="Legal Risk Ethical" /&gt;
* Variety of data: principles for collection, retention and exploitation
* Education mission: underlying issues of learning management, including social and performance engineering
* Motivation for development of analytics: mutuality, a combination of corporate, individual and general good
* Customer expectation: effective business practice, social data expectations, cultural considerations of a global customer base.
* Obligation to act: duty of care arising from knowledge and the consequent challenges of student and employee performance management

In some prominent cases like the inBloom disaster,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-01/inbloom-shuts-down-amid-privacy-fears-over-student-data-tracking&lt;/ref&gt; even full functional systems have been shut down due to lack of trust in the data collection by governments, stakeholders and civil rights groups. Since then, the learning analytics community has extensively studied legal conditions in a series of experts workshops on "Ethics &amp; Privacy 4 Learning Analytics" that constitute the use of trusted learning analytics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laceproject.eu/ethics-privacy-learning-analytics/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} Drachsler &amp; Greller released a 8-point checklist named DELICATE that is based on the intensive studies in this area to demystify the ethics and privacy discussions around learning analytics.&lt;ref&gt;Drachsler, H. &amp; Greller, W. (2016). Privacy and Analytics – it's a DELICATE issue. A Checklist to establish trusted Learning Analytics. 6th Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference 2016, April 25–29, 2016, Edinburgh, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
# D-etermination: Decide on the purpose of learning analytics for your institution.
# E-xplain: Define the scope of data collection and usage.
# L-egitimate: Explain how you operate within the legal frameworks, refer to the essential legislation.
# I-nvolve: Talk to stakeholders and give assurances about the data distribution and use.
# C-onsent: Seek consent through clear consent questions.
# A-nonymise: De-identify individuals as much as possible
# T-echnical aspects: Monitor who has access to data, especially in areas with high staff turn-over.
# E-xternal partners: Make sure externals provide highest data security standards

It shows ways to design and provide privacy conform learning analytics that can benefit all stakeholders. The full DELICATE checklist is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;http://de.slideshare.net/Drachsler/delicate-checklist-to-establish-trusted-learning-analytics&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11755">In the field of [[pedagogy]], '''learning by teaching''' (German: ''Lernen durch Lehren'', short '''LdL''') is a method of teaching in which students are made to learn material and prepare [[lesson]]s to teach it to the other students. There is a strong emphasis on acquisition of [[life skills]] along with the subject matter. This method was originally defined by [[Jean-Pol Martin]] in the 1980s.

== Background ==
[[Image:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|250px|Student teaching vocabulary]]
The method of having students teach other students has been present since antiquity.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heinrich |first1=Christian |title=Learning by Teaching: The Goal is Independence |url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/prj/sog/mud/en3913352.htm |work=Goethe-Institut |date=November 2007 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this was due to lack of resources.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  For example, the [[Monitorial System]] was an education method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century. It was developed in parallel by  Scotsman [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who had worked in [[Madras]] and [[Joseph Lancaster]] who worked in London; each attempted to educate masses of poor children with scant resources by having older children teach younger children what they had already learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Frank Pierrepont |title=A Student's History of Education |date=1915 |publisher=Macmillan Company |pages=239ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic research into intentionally improving education, by having students learn by teaching began in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gartner |first1=Alan |last2=Kohler |first2=Mary Conway |last3=Riessman |first3=Frank |title=Children teach children; learning by teaching |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013553-0 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Jean-Pol Martin]] systematically developed the concept of having students teach other in the context of learning [[French language|French]] as a [[foreign language]], and he gave it a theoretical background in numerous publications.&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;  The method was originally resisted, as the German educational system generally emphasized discipline and rote learning.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  However the method became widely used in Germany in secondary education, and in the 1990s it was further formalized and began to be used in universities as well.&lt;ref name=Safiye&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safiye |first1=Aslan, |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers. |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice |date=October 5, 2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?q=EJ1101263 |language=en |issn=1303-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008 Martin had retired, and although he remained active [[Joachim Grzega]] took the lead in developing and promulgating LdL.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPMabout&gt;{{cite web |title=About me |url=https://jeanpol.wordpress.com/about-me/ |publisher=Jean-Pol Martins Weblog |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=de-DE |date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
[[File:Learning by teaching phases.png|thumb|left|LDL, modeled on the structure of the brain by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahl |first1=von Reinhard |title=Treibhäuser der Zukunft wie in Deutschland Schulen gelingen ; eine Dokumentation |date=2005 |publisher=Archiv der Zukunft [u.a.] |location=Berlin |isbn=3-407-85830-2 |edition= 2nd, überarb. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After preparation by the teacher, students become responsible for their own learning and teaching. The new material is divided into small units and student groups of not more than three people are formed.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

Students are then encouraged to experiment to find ways to teach the material to the others. Along with ensuring that students learn the material, another goal of the method, is to teach students [[life skills]] like respect for other people, planning, problem solving, taking chances in public, and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thimm |first1=Katja |title="Guten Morgen, liebe Zahlen" |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-23011324.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahl |first1=Reinhard |title=Unterricht: Schüler als Lehrer |url=https://www.zeit.de/online/2008/43/schueler-lehrer |work=Zeit |date=October 22, 2008 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stollhans |first1=S. |editor1-last=Corradini |editor1-first=E. |editor2-last=Borthwick |editor2-first=K. |editor3-last=Gallagher-Brett |editor3-first=A. |title=Employability for languages: a handbook |date=2016 |publisher=Researchpublishing.net |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-908416-39-1 |pages=161–164 |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.14705/rpnet.2016.cbg2016.478 |chapter=Learning by teaching: developing transferable skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grzega |first1=Joachim |last2=Schöner |first2=Marion |title=The didactic model LdL (Lernen durch Lehren) as a way of preparing students for communication in a knowledge society |journal=Journal of Education for Teaching |date=4 July 2008 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=167–175 |doi=10.1080/02607470802212157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The teacher remains actively involved, stepping in to further explain or provide support if the teaching-students falter or the learning-students do not seem to understand the material.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

The method is distinct from [[tutoring]] in that LdL is done in class, supported by the teacher, and distinct from [[student teaching]], which is a part of [[teacher education]].&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;

== Plastic Platypus Learning ==
One way of learning by teaching, is the '''plastic platypus learning''' or '''platypus learning''' technique. This technique is based on evidence that show that teaching an inanimate object improves understanding and knowledge retention of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/ | title=Learning by teaching others is extremely effective – a new study tested a key reason why| date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aslan |first1=Safiye |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice |date=2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |doi=10.12738/estp.2016.1.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=Schul |first2=Yaacov |title=On the cognitive benefits of teaching. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=1980 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.72.5.593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of this technique is that that the learner does not need the presence of another person in order to teach the subject.

The name 'plastic platypus learning' is a paraphrase on the known [[software engineering]] technique [[rubber duck debugging]], in which a programmer can find bugs in their code without the help of others, simply by explaining what the code does, line by line, to an inanimate object - namely, a rubber duck.

[[File:Plastic platypus learning cropped.jpg|thumb|Plastic platypus learning in action]]
To increase the effectiveness of plastic platypus learning, learners are advised to do the following:

1. Prepare notes while learning the subject.

2. Prepare the lesson on the subject (as opposed to just teaching it unprepared; this section demands the most time and energy, and may be omitted in some situations).

3. Teach the subject without using the notes at all (the student knows this beforehand).
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/acp.3410|title = The learning benefits of teaching: A retrieval practice hypothesis| journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology| volume=32| issue=3| pages=401–410|year = 2018|last1 = Koh|first1 = Aloysius Wei Lun| last2=Lee| first2=Sze Chi| last3=Lim| first3=Stephen Wee Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously, this technique may work with any inanimate object, and not just plastic platypuses.

'''Man: A Course of Study''', usually known by the acronym '''MACOS''' or '''M.A.C.O.S.''', was an [[United States|American]] [[humanities]] teaching program, popular in America and Britain in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=51241|title=Through These Eyes|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the theories of [[Jerome Bruner]], particularly his concept of the "[[spiral curriculum]]". This suggested that a concept might be taught repeatedly within a [[curriculum]], but at a number of levels, each level being more complex than the first. The process of repetition would thus enable the child to absorb more complex ideas easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jerome-s-bruner-influential-psychologist-of-perception-dies-at-100/2016/06/07/033e5870-2cc3-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html|title=Jerome S. Bruner, Influential Psychologist of Perception, Dies at 100|publisher=The Washington Post|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=June 7, 2016|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infed.org/mobi/jerome-bruner-and-the-process-of-education/|title=Jerome Bruner and the Process of Education|publisher=Infed|first=Mark|last=Smith|date=2002|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In MACOS, the concept was "the chain of [[life]]" or a "lifeline": the entire history of a living thing. The course started with a simple lifespan in the form of the Pacific Coast [[salmon]]. It then moved on to the more complex life form of the [[herring gull]], introducing concepts such as nurturing. The lifespan of the [[baboon]] was next examined, particularly within the societal context afforded by the [[baboon#Society|baboon troop]]. The differences between [[innate behaviour]] and [[learning|learned]] behaviour were introduced. Finally, the study opened up into a study of a man's lifespan with a case study of [[Netsilik Inuit]]. This also included the interaction between the Netsilik and other life forms, such as [[reindeer]] and [[pinniped|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/25/archives/the-proper-study-of-mankind-.html|title=The Proper Study of Mankind|publisher=The New York Times|first=Lee|last=Dembart|date=April 25, 1976|access-date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course comprised a self-contained kit of course materials, film cassettes, visual aids, and games. Some of the activities were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [[wikt:migration|migration]] had a loaded [[dice|die]] to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the [[Netsilik]] community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.

The emphasis of the course was upon learning particular skills within the teaching process, not upon the significance of the content. This included the necessity to ask questions, discuss, and reach conclusions based on evidence and argument.

The course was much criticized in the United States because of its emphasis upon questioning aspects of life, including belief and morality. It was particularly targeted by [[fundamentalist]] groups, evidenced by quotations included in the course booklet. In 2004, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] produced  ''Through These Eyes'', a documentary about the controversy surrounding MACOS, and more generally about the interplay between politics and education.&lt;ref&gt;Kincheloe,  Joe L. &amp;  Horn, Raymond A.(Eds).

'''Mentorship''' is a relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The [[mentor]] may be older or younger than the person being mentored, but he or she must have a certain area of expertise.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"/&gt; It is a learning and development partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farren Ph.D.|first1=Caela|title=Eight Types of Mentor: Which Ones Do You Need?|url=http://www.masteryworks.com/newsite/downloads/Article3_EightTypesofMentors-WhichOnesdoyouNeed.pdf|publisher=MasteryWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentorship experience and relationship structure affect the "amount of psychosocial support, career guidance, role modeling, and communication that occurs in the mentoring relationships in which the protégés and mentors engaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagenson-Eland | first1 = Ellen A. | last2 = Marks | first2 = Michelle A. | last3 = Amendola | first3 = Karen L. | year = 1997 | title = Perceptions of mentoring relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 29–42 | doi=10.1006/jvbe.1997.1592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person in receipt of mentorship may be referred to as a '''''protégé''''' (male), a '''''protégée''''' (female), an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] or, in the 2000s, a '''mentee'''. The mentor may be referred to as a '''''godfather''''' or '''''godmother'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CXO Today|url=http://www.cxotoday.com/story/mentors-play-godfather-to-wiproites/|title=Mentors Play Godfather To Wiproites|author= CXOtoday Staff  |date=  September 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Very HUGE Reason You Aren't Getting Promoted in Human Resources…|website=Success in HR|author=Collins, Alan|url=http://successinhr.com/not-getting-promoted-in-hr|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''''rabbi'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=PoliceMag.com|url=http://www.policemag.com/cop-slang/rabbi.aspx|title=Cop slang: Rabbi|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mentoring" is a process that always involves communication and is relationship-based, but its precise definition is elusive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawson|first1=Phillip|title=Beyond a Definition: Toward a Framework for Designing and Specifying Mentoring Models|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=43|issue=3|pages=137–145|doi=10.3102/0013189X14528751|url=http://edr.sagepub.com/content/43/3/137.short|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 50 definitions currently in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crisp|first1=G.|last2=Cruz|first2=I.|title=Mentoring college students: A critical review of the literature between 1990 and 2007|journal=Research in Higher Education|date=2009|volume=50|pages=525–545|doi=10.1007/s11162-009-9130-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One definition of the many that have been proposed, is {{quote|Mentoring is a process for the informal transmission of knowledge, [[social capital]], and the psychosocial support perceived by the recipient as relevant to work, career, or professional development; mentoring entails informal communication, usually face-to-face and during a sustained period of time, between a person who is perceived to have greater relevant knowledge, wisdom, or experience (the mentor) and a person who is perceived to have less (the protégé)".&lt;ref name="BozemanFeeney2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bozeman |first1=B. |last2=Feeney |first2=M.

==Historical==
[[File:Age Teaching Youth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William Blake's watercolor of "Age teaching youth", a Romantic representation of mentorship. Blake represented this type of relationship in many of his works, including the illustrations of his ''[[Songs of Innocence]]''. The original object is currently held by [[Tate Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-age-teaching-youth-n05183| title = William BlakeAge Teaching Youth c.1785-90| publisher = [[Tate Britain]]| accessdate = January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The roots of the practice are lost in antiquity. The word itself was inspired by the character of [[Mentor (Odyssey)|Mentor]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. Though the actual Mentor in the story is a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess [[Athena]] takes on his appearance in order to guide young [[Telemachus]] in his time of difficulty.

Historically significant systems of mentorship include the [[Guru–shishya tradition|guru–disciple tradition]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yogicwayoflife.com/the-guru-disciple-tradition/|title=Guru Disciple Tradition - The Spiritual Lineage|date=2016-10-07|work=Yogic Way Of Life|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;practiced in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]]s, the discipleship system practiced by [[Rabbi]]nical [[Judaism]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bible.org/article/being-first-century-disciple|title=Being a First-Century Disciple|work=Bible.org|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[apprentice|apprenticing]] under the medieval [[guild]] system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/2009/05/13/chapter-3-the-guilds-and-apprenticeships/|title=Chapter 3 – The Guilds and Apprenticeships|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the United States, advocates for workplace equity in the second half of the twentieth century popularized the term "mentor" and concept of career mentorship as part of a larger [[social capital]] lexicon which also includes terms such as [[glass ceiling]], bamboo ceiling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asian American and Pacific Islander Work Group Report|url = http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/reports/aapi.html|website = www.eeoc.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[personal network|networking]], [[role model]], and [[gatekeeper]]—serving to identify and address the problems barring non-dominant groups from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, promoting them as pathways to success for all career climbers. In 1970, these terms were not in the general American vocabulary; by the mid-1990s they had become part of everyday speech.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

== Professional bodies and qualifications ==
The [[European Mentoring and Coaching Council]], also called the EMCC, is the leading global body in terms of creating and maintaining a range of industry standard frameworks, rules and processes across the mentoring and related supervision and coaching fields e.g. a code of practice for those practising mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3tAv72yfBMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJwKzB8bfTAhUGU1AKHa1mBa0Q6AEIITAA#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=Facilitating Reflective Learning Through Mentoring &amp; Coaching|first1=Anne|last1=Brockbank|first2=Ian|last2=McGill|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vH1LpGVEgPgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJwKzB8bfTAhUGU1AKHa1mBa0Q6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Guide to Mentoring: How to Design, Implement and Evaluate Effective Mentoring Programmes|first=Hilarie|last=Owen|date=3 October 2011|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1vf9RatJhkC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=emcc%20mentoring&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5lYud8rfTAhUCEVAKHSmuD0g4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=emcc%20mentoring&amp;f=false|title=Coaching and Mentoring in Health and Social Care: The Essentials of Practice for Professionals and Organisations|first=Julia|last=Foster-Turner|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Radcliffe Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The focus of mentoring is to develop the whole person and so the techniques are broad and require wisdom in order to be used appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Effective Teaching and Mentoring| author=Daloz, L. A. | year=1990 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1995 study of mentoring techniques most commonly used in business&lt;ref name="Aubrey1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=Working Wisdom: Timeless Skills and Vanguard Strategies for Learning Organizations |publisher=Jossey Bass |year=1995 |pages=23, 44–47, 96–97 |author1=Aubrey, Bob  |author2=Cohen, Paul |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the five most commonly used techniques among mentors were:

# ''Accompanying:'' making a commitment in a caring way, which involves taking part in the learning process side-by-side with the learner.
# ''Sowing:'' mentors are often confronted with the difficulty of preparing the learner before he or she is ready to change. Sowing is necessary when you know that what you say may not be understood or even acceptable to learners at first but will make sense and have value to the mentee when the situation requires it.
# ''Catalyzing:'' when change reaches a critical level of pressure, learning can escalate. Here the mentor chooses to plunge the learner right into change, provoking a different way of thinking, a change in identity or a re-ordering of values.
# ''Showing:'' this is making something understandable, or using your own example to demonstrate a skill or activity. You show what you are talking about, you show by your own behavior.
# ''Harvesting:'' here the mentor focuses on "picking the ripe fruit": it is usually used to create awareness of what was learned by experience and to draw conclusions. The key questions here are: "What have you learned?", "How useful is it?".

Different techniques may be used by mentors according to the situation and the mindset of the mentee, and the techniques used in modern organizations can be found in ancient education systems, from the Socratic technique of harvesting to the accompaniment method of learning used in the apprenticeship of itinerant cathedral builders during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Aubrey1995"/&gt; Leadership authors Jim Kouzes and [[Barry Z. Posner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Credibility |author1=Posner, B.  |author2=Kouzes, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1993 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; advise mentors to look for "teachable moments" in order to "expand or realize the potentialities of the people in the organizations they lead" and underline that personal credibility is as essential to quality mentoring as skill.
[[File:Senior editor mentoring junior editor.jpg |thumb|right|200px|A senior editor mentors a junior editor.]]
'''Multiple mentors''': A new and upcoming trend is having multiple mentors.&lt;ref name=Ensher2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ensher|first1=E.|last2=Heun|first2=C.|last3=Blanchard|first3=A.|title=Online mentoring and computer-mediated communication: New directions in research|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=63|pages=264–288|doi=10.1016/s0001-8791(03)00044-7|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be helpful because we can all learn from each other. Having more than one mentor will widen the knowledge of the person being mentored. There are different mentors who may have different strengths.

'''Profession or trade mentor''': This is someone who is currently in the trade/profession you are entering. They know the trends, important changes and new practices that you should know to stay at the top of your career. A mentor like this would be someone you can discuss ideas regarding the field, and also be introduced to key and important people that you should know.

'''Industry mentor''': This is someone who doesn't just focus on the profession. This mentor will be able to give insight on the industry as a whole. Whether it be research, development or key changes in the industry, you need to know.

'''Organization mentor''': Politics in the organizations are constantly changing. It is important to be knowledgeable about the values, strategies and products that are within your company, but also when these things are changing. An organization mentor can clarify missions and strategies, and give clarity when needed.

'''Work process mentor''': This mentor can speed quickly over the bumps, and cut through the unnecessary work. This mentor can explain the 'ins and outs' of projects, day to day tasks, and eliminate unnecessary things that may be currently going on in your work day. This mentor can help to get things done quickly and efficiently.

'''Technology mentor''': This is an up-and-coming, incredibly important position. Technology has been rapidly improving, and becoming more a part of day to day transactions within companies. In order to perform your best, you must know how to get things done on the newest technology. A technology mentor will help with technical breakdowns, advise on systems that may work better than what you're currently using, and coach you through new technology and how to best use it and implement it into your daily life.

These mentors are only examples. There can be many more different types of mentors. Look around your workplace, your life, and see who is an expert that you can learn something from.&lt;ref name="MasteryWorks"/&gt;

[[File:What is mentoring (14805966275).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Some elements of mentoring.]]

There are two broad types of mentoring relationships: formal and informal.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Formal mentoring relationships are set up by an administrative unit or office in a company or organization, which solicits and recruits qualified individuals who are willing to mentor, provides training to the mentors, and then helps to match the mentors up with a person in need of mentoring. While formal mentoring systems contain numerous structural and guidance elements, they still typically allow the mentor and mentee to have an active role in choosing who they want to work with. Formal mentoring programs which simply assign mentors to mentees without giving these individuals a say have not performed well. Even though a mentor and a mentee may seem perfectly matched "on paper", in practice, they may have different working or learning styles. As such, giving the mentor and the mentee the opportunity to help select who they want to work with is a widely used approach. Informal mentoring occurs without the use of structured recruitment, mentor training and matching services. Informal mentoring arrangements can develop naturally from [[business networking]] situations in which a more experienced individual meets a new employee, and the two strike up a rapport.

In addition to these broad types, there are also peer, situational and supervisory mentoring relationships.{{cn|date=June 2018}} These tend to fall under the categories of formal and informal mentoring relationships. Informal relationships develop on their own between partners. Formal mentoring, on the other hand, refers to a structured process supported by the organization and addressed to target populations. '''Youth mentoring programs''' assist at-risk children or youth who lack role models and sponsors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/youth-mentoring/overview/main|title=Chapter 22. Youth Mentoring Programs {{!}} Section 1. Building Youth Mentoring Programs {{!}} Main Section {{!}} Community Tool Box|website=ctb.ku.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In business, formal mentoring is part of [[talent management]] strategies which are used to groom key employees, newly hired graduates, high potential-employees and future leaders. The matching of mentor and mentee is often done by a mentoring coordinator, often with the help of a computerized database registry. The use of the database helps to match up mentees with mentors who have the type of experience and qualifications they are seeking.
[[File:Lynne Featherstone mentoring at Youth For Change (14677364996).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A woman provides mentoring at the Youth For Change program.]]
There are formal mentoring programs that are values-oriented, while social mentoring and other types focus specifically on career development. Some mentorship programs provide both social and vocational support. In well-designed formal mentoring programs, there are program goals, schedules, training (for both mentors and protégés), and evaluation. In 2004 Metizo created the first mentoring certification for companies and business schools in order to guarantee the integrity and effectiveness of formal mentoring. Certification is attributed jointly by the organization and an external expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metizo.com/home/how-metizo-certifies-personal-development |title=How Metizo certifies personal development |publisher=Metizo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many kinds of mentoring relationships from school or community-based relationships to e-mentoring relationships. These mentoring relationships vary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/4-key-facets-of-successful-mentoring-relationships.html|title=4 Key Facets of Successful Mentoring Relationships|date=2017-08-11|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be influenced by the type of mentoring relationship that is in effect. That is whether it has come about as a formal or informal relationship. Also there are several models have been used to describe and examine the sub-relationships that can emerge. For example, Buell describes how mentoring relationships can develop under a cloning model, nurturing model, friendship model and apprenticeship model. The cloning model is about the mentor trying to "produce a duplicate copy of him or her self." The nurturing model takes more of a "parent figure, creating a safe, open environment in which mentee can both learn and try things for him-or herself." The friendship model are more peers "rather than being involved in a hierarchical relationship." Lastly, the apprenticeship is about less "personal or social aspects... and the professional relationship is the sole focus".&lt;ref name="Buell2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Buell | first = Cindy | title = Models of Mentoring in Communication |journal = Communication Review | issue = 1 | issn = 1479-5795 |date = January 2004 |pages = 56–73 | volume = 53 | doi=10.1080/0363452032000135779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sub-groups of formal and informal mentoring relationships: peer mentoring relationships are relationships where individuals are at the same skill training, similar positions and stages of career. However, one person may be more knowledgeable in a certain aspect or another, but they can help each other to progress in their work. A lot of time, peer relationships provide a lot of support, empathy and advice because the situations are quite similar.

'''Situational mentoring''': Short-term relationships in which a person mentors for a specific purpose. This could be a company bringing an expert in regarding social media, or internet safety. This expert can mentor employees to make them more knowledgeable about a specific topic or skill.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Supervisory mentoring''': This kind of mentoring has'go to' people who are supervisors. These are people who have answers to many questions, and can advise to take the best plan of action. This can be a conflict of interest relationship because many supervisors do not feel comfortable also being a mentor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.wustl.edu/Resources/PERCSS/library/Pages/mentoringtypes.aspx research.wustl.edu], Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mentoring circles''': Participants from all levels of the organization propose and own a topic. They then meet in groups to discuss the topic, which motivates them to grow and become more knowledgeable. Flash mentoring is ideal for job shadowing, reverse mentoring, and more.

'''Flash mentoring''': Creates a low-pressure environment for mentoring that focuses on single meetings rather than a traditional, long-term mentoring relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronus.com/modern-mentoring-flash-mentoring-for-organizations chronus.com], Chronus.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

Meta-analysis of 112 individual research studies found mentoring has significant behavioral, attitudinal, health-related, relational, motivational, and career benefits.&lt;ref name=Eby2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eby|first1=Lillian|last2=Allen|first2=Tammy|last3=Evans|first3=Sarah|last4=Ng|first4=Thomas|last5=DuBois|first5=David|title=Does mentoring matter?

These benefits for a mentee depend on which of the different (not mutually exclusive) functions is performed by the mentor. Originally, the concept of mentoring functions was developed based on [[qualitative research]] in a organizational context with functions being subsumed under two major factors: [[psychosocial support]] (e.g. [[Role model|role modeling]], friendship, emotional support, encouragement) and career-related support (e.g. providing advice, discussing goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kram|first=Kathy E.|date=1983|title=Phases of the Mentor Relationship|url=http://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/255910|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=608–625|doi=10.5465/255910|issn=0001-4273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early quantitative approach found role modeling to be a distinct third factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scandura|first=Terri A.|last2=Ragins|first2=Belle Rose|date=1993|title=The Effects of Sex and Gender Role Orientation on Mentorship in Male-Dominated Occupations|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001879183710468|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=43|issue=3|pages=251–265|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1993.1046|issn=0001-8791|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mentoring for [[Academic achievement|college success]], a fourth function concerning knowledge transfer was additionally identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nora|first=Amaury|last2=Crisp|first2=Gloria|date=November 2007|title=Mentoring Students: Conceptualizing and Validating the Multi-Dimensions of a Support System|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/CS.9.3.e|journal=Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory &amp; Practice|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=337–356|doi=10.2190/cs.9.3.e|issn=1521-0251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research also found this function in the context of mentoring [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|last2=Schlichting|first2=Kerrin|last3=Kaernbach|first3=Christian|date=2017|title=Mentoring functions: Interpersonal tensions are associated with mentees’ creative achievement.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/aca0000103|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=440–450|doi=10.1037/aca0000103|issn=1931-390X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially in the workplace, there are also many benefits for an employer in developing a mentorship program for new and current employees.

'''Career development''': Setting up a career development mentoring program for employees enables an organization to help junior employees to learn the skills and behaviours from senior employees that the junior employees need to advance to higher-responsibility positions. This type of mentoring program can help to align organizational goals with employees' personal career goals (of progressing within the organization). It gives employees the ability to advance professionally and learn more about their work. This collaboration also gives employees a feeling of engagement with the organization, which can lead to better retention rates and increased employee satisfaction.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''High potential mentoring''': The most talented employees in organizations tend to be difficult to retain, as they are usually seeking greater challenges and responsibilities, and they are likely to leave for a different organization if they do not feel that they are being given the opportunity to develop. Top talent, whether in an innovation or management role, have incredible potential to make great things happen for an organization. Creating a mentoring program for high-potential employees that gives them one-on-one guidance from senior leaders can help to build the engagement of these talented employees, give them the opportunity to develop, and increase their retention in the organization.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Diversity mentoring''': One of the top ways to innovate is by bringing in new ideas from senior employees and leaders from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, ethnic minorities, etc.). Who is an underrepresented group depends on the industry sector and country. In many Western countries, women and ethnic minorities are significantly underrepresented in executive positions and boards of directors. In some traditionally gender segregated occupations, such as [[education]] and [[nursing]], however, women may be the dominant gender in the workforce. Mentors from underrepresented groups can empower employees from underrepresented groups to increase their confidence to take on higher-responsibility tasks and prepare for leadership roles. By developing employees from diverse groups, this can give the organization access to new ideas, new ways of looking at problems, and new perspectives. This also brings cultural awareness and intercultural  dialogue into the workplace.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
[[File:119th Wing Airman promotes mentoring youth 150416-Z-WA217-001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A US Air Force member providing youth mentoring.]]
'''Reverse mentoring''': While mentoring typically involves a more experienced, typically older employee or leader providing guidance to a younger employee, the opposite approach can also be used. In the 2000s, with the rise of digital innovations, Internet applications and [[social media]], in some cases, new, young employees are more familiar with these technologies than senior employees in the organizations. The younger generations can help the older generations to expand and grow towards current trends. Everyone has something to bring to the table, this creates a "two way street" within companies where younger employees can see the larger picture, and senior employees can learn from young employees.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Knowledge transfer mentoring''': Employees must have a certain set of skills in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. Mentoring is a great approach to help employees get organized, and give them access to an expert that can give feedback, and help answer questions that they may not know where to find answers to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chronus|title=Mentoring &amp; Talent Development Solutions|url=http://chronus.com/how-to-use-mentoring-in-your-workplace|website=chronus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentorship provides critical benefits to individuals as well as organizations. Although mentorship can be important for an individual's career advancement, in the United States it historically has been most apparent in relation to the advancement of women and minorities in the workplace. Until recent decades, American men in dominant ethnic groups gained most of the benefits of mentorship without consciously identifying it as an advancement strategy. American women and minorities, in contrast, more pointedly identified and pursued mentorship in the second half of the twentieth century as they sought to achieve the professional success they had long been denied.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

In a 1958 study, Margaret Cussler showed that, for each female executive she interviewed who did not own her own company, "something—or someone—gave her a push up the ladder while others halted on a lower rung." Cussler concluded that the relationship between the "sponsor and protégé" (the vocabulary of "mentorship" was not yet in common use) was the "magic formula" for success.&lt;ref name="Cussler, Margaret"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cussler|first=Margaret|title=The Woman Executive|year=1958|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, numerous publications had established the centrality of mentorship to business success for everyone and particularly for women trying to break into the male-dominated business world. These publications noted the many specific benefits provided by mentorship, which included insider information, education, guidance, moral support, inspiration, sponsorship, an example to follow, protection, promotion, the ability to "bypass the hierarchy," the projection of the superior's "reflected power," access to otherwise invisible opportunities, and [[Tutor|tutelage]] in corporate politics.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

This literature also showed the value of these benefits. A ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' survey of 1,250 top executives published in 1979, for example, showed that most had been mentored or sponsored and that those who received such assistance reported higher income, a better education, a quicker path to achievement, and more job satisfaction than those who did not.&lt;ref name="Roche, Gerard R."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roche|first=Gerard R.|title=Much Ado about Mentors|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=January–February 1979|pages=14–28|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature particularly emphasized the necessity of mentoring for businesswomen's success.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt; For example, although women made up less than one percent of the executives in the ''Harvard Business Review'' survey, all of these women reported being mentored.&lt;ref name="Roche, Gerard R."/&gt; In subsequent decades, as mentoring became a widely valued phenomenon in the United States, women and minorities in particular continued to develop mentoring relationships consciously as they sought professional advancement.&lt;ref name="Laird, Pamela Walker"/&gt;

==Contemporary research and practice in the US==
Research in the 1970s, partly in response to a study by [[Daniel Levinson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seasons of a Man's Life |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel S. |last2=Darrow |first2=C. N, |last3=Klein |first3=E. B. |last4=Levinson |first4=M. |year=1978 |location=New York |publisher=Random House. |isbn=0-394-40694-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; led some women and African Americans to question whether the classic "white male" model was available or customary for people who are newcomers in traditionally white male organizations. In 1978 [[Edgar Schein]] described multiple roles for successful mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Career Dynamics: Matching Individual and Organizational Needs |last1=Schein |first1=Edgar H. |publisher=Addison-Wesley |date=June 1978 |isbn=0-201-06834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified seven types of mentoring roles in his book entitled, ''Career Dynamics: Matching individual and organizational needs'' (1978). He said that some of these roles require the teacher to be in a position of power such as "opener of doors, protector, sponsor and leader."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Capability frameworks encourage managers to mentor staff. A manager can mentor their own staff, but more likely will mentor staff in other parts of their organisation, staff in special programs (such as graduate and leadership programs), staff in other organisations or members of professional associations.

Mentoring covers a range of roles. Articulating these roles is useful not only for understanding what role you play, but also for writing job applications. Demonstrating how you go about mentoring needs a language of behaviours.

Two of Schein's students, Davis and Garrison, undertook to study successful leaders of both genders and at least two races. Their research presented evidence for the roles of: cheerleader, coach, confidant, counsellor, developer of talent, "griot" (oral historian for the organization or profession), guardian, guru, inspiration, master, "opener of doors", patron, role model, pioneer, "seminal source", "successful leader", and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis, Jr |first1=Robert L. |last2=Garrison |first2=Patricia A. |year=1979 |title=Mentoring: in search of a typology (MIT Sloan Master Thesis)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They described multiple mentoring practices which have since been given the name of "mosaic mentoring" to distinguish this kind of mentoring from the single mentor approach.

Mosaic mentoring is based on the concept that almost everyone can perform one or another function well for someone else — and also can learn along one of these lines from someone else. The model is seen as useful for people who are "non-traditional" in a traditional setting, such as people of color and women in a traditionally white male organization. The idea has been well received in medical education literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Periyakoil, Vyjeyanthi S. |title=Journal of Palliative Medicine |date=October 2007 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=1048–1049 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2006.9911 |journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine |pmid=17985959}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mosaic mentoring programs in various faith-based organizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Corporate programs==
[[File:MOI PA video mentoring (4476152064).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A NATO mentor trains two broadcasters on video editing and storytelling techniques.]] 
Corporate mentoring programs are used by mid-size to large organizations to further the development and retention of employees. Mentoring programs may be formal or informal and serve a variety of specific objectives including acclimation of new employees, skills development, employee retention and diversity enhancement.

===Formal programs===
Formal mentoring programs offer employees the opportunity to participate in an organized mentoring program. Participants join as a mentor, protégé or both by completing a mentoring profile. Mentoring profiles are completed as written forms on paper or computer or filled out via an online form as part of an online mentoring system. Protégés are matched with a mentor by a program administrator or a mentoring committee, or may self-select a mentor depending on the program format.

Informal mentoring takes places in organizations that develop a culture of mentoring but do not have formal mentoring in place. These companies may provide some tools and resources and encourage managers to accept mentoring requests from more junior members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartblogs.com/leadership/2012/04/13/how-can-corporate-mentoring-work-for-your-company/],''SmartBlog on Leadership'', 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 1,162 employees found that "satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than the presence of a mentor, whether the relationship was formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ragins | first1 =  | last2 = Rose | first2 = Belle | last3 = Cotton | first3 = John L. | last4 = Miller | first4 = Janice S. | year = 2000 | title = Marginal mentoring: The effects of type of mentor, quality of relationship, and program design on work and career attitudes | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 6| pages = 1177–1194 | doi=10.2307/1556344}}&lt;/ref&gt; So even when a mentoring relationship is established, the actual relationship is more important than the presence of a relationship.

Fortune 500 companies are also implementing formal mentoring programs on a global scale. [[Cardinal Health]] has had an enterprise-wide formal mentoring initiative in place since 2011. The initiative encompasses nine formal mentoring programs, some enterprise-wide and some limited to specific business segments and functions. Goals vary by program, with some focused on employees facing specific challenges or career milestones and others enabling more open-ended learning and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mentorcliq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cardinal-Health-Mentoring-Case-Study-Conducted-by-APQC-1.pdf|title=Cardinal Health INC Case Study - Technical Mentoring|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New-hire programs===
New-hire mentoring programs are set up to help new employees acclimate more quickly into the organization. In new-hire mentoring programs, newcomers to the organization (protégés) are paired with more experienced people (mentors) in order to obtain information, good examples, and advice as they advance. It has been claimed that new employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kaye | first1 = Beverly |last2=Jordan-Evans| title = Love 'Em or Lose Em: Getting Good People to Stay| publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc | year = 2005 | location = San Francisco | page = 117 | isbn=978-1-57675-327-9 |first2=Sharon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mentoring relationships provide substance for career growth and benefit both the mentor and the protégé. For example, the mentor gets to show leadership by giving back and perhaps being refreshed about their own work. The organization receives an employee that is being gradually introduced and shaped by the organization's culture and operation because they have been under the mentorship of an experienced member. The person being mentored networks, becomes integrated easier in an organization, gets experience and advice along the way.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"/&gt; It has been said that "joining a mentor's network and developing one's own is central to advancement" and this is possibly why those mentored tend to do well in their organizations.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pompper |first1=D. |last2=Adams |first2=J. |title=Under the microscope: Gender and mentor-protege relationships |journal=Public Relations Review |issue=32 |pages=309–315 |publisher=Science Direct |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the organizational setting, mentoring usually "requires unequal knowledge",&lt;ref name="BozemanFeeney2007"/&gt; but the process of mentorship can differ. Bullis describes the mentoring process in the forms of phase models. Initially, the "mentee proves himself or herself worthy of the mentor's time and energy". Then cultivation occurs which includes the actual "coaching...a strong interpersonal bond between mentor and mentee develops". Next, under the phase of separation, "the mentee experiences more autonomy". Ultimately, there is more of equality in the relationship, termed by Bullis as Redefinition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullis |first1=C. |last2=Bach |first2=W. B. |title=Are mentor relationships helping organizations? An exploration of developing mentee-mentor-organizational identification using turning point analysis |journal=Communication Quarterly |issue=3 |pages=199–213 |year=1989 |volume=37 |doi=10.1080/01463378909385540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-potential programs===
High-potential mentoring programs are used to groom up-and-coming employees deemed to have the potential to move up into [[leadership]] or executive roles. Here the employee (protégé) is paired with a senior-level leader (or leaders) for a series of [[career]]-[[coaching]] interactions. These programs tend to be smaller than more general mentoring programs and mentees must be selected based on a list of eligibility criteria to participate. Another method of high-potential mentoring is to place the employee in a series of jobs in disparate areas of an organization (e.g., human resources, sales, operations management, etc.) all for short periods of time, so they can learn in a "hands-on", practical fashion, about the organization's structure, culture, and methods.

==Matching approaches==
;Matching by committee
Mentees are matched with mentors by a designated mentoring committee or mentoring administrator usually consisting of senior members of the training, learning and development group and/or the human resources departments.  The matching committee reviews the mentors' profiles and the coaching goals sought out by the mentees and makes matches based on areas for development, mentor strengths, overall experience, skill set, location and objectives.

;Matching through self-match technology
Mentoring technology, typically based on computer software, can be used to facilitate matches allowing mentees to search and select a mentor based on their own development and coaching needs and interests. This mentee-driven methodology increases the speed in which matches are created and reduces the amount of administrative time required to manage the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobscot.com/press/Workforce_Mentor-Scout-Client-Success-Story.pdf],''Matchmaker, Matchmaker Make Me a Mentor Match'', Workforce Magazine, 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of matches increases as well with self-match programs because the greater the involvement of the mentee in the selection of their mentor, the better the outcome of the mentorship.&lt;ref name="Allen TD, Eby LT, Lentz e 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=TD. |last2=Eby |first2=LT. |last3=Lentz |first3=E |title=Mentorship behaviors and mentorship quality associated with formal mentoring programs: closing the gap between research and practice |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=91 | issue = 3 |pages=567–578|year=2006 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.3.567|pmid=16737355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of online mentoring technology programs available that can be utilized to facilitate this mentee-driven matching process.

;Speed mentoring
[[Speed Networking|Speed mentoring]] follows some of the procedures of [[speed dating]]. Mentors and mentees are introduced to each other in short sessions, allowing each person to meet multiple potential matches in a very short timeframe. Speed mentoring occur as a one-time event in order for people "to meet potential mentors to see if there is a fit for a longer term engagement."&lt;ref&gt;http://iainstitute.org/documents/mentoring/Speed-Mentoring-Procedures-on-site-event.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
{{main|Peer mentoring}}
In many secondary and post-secondary schools, mentorship programs are offered to support students in program completion, confidence building and transitioning to further education or the workforce. There are also [[peer mentoring]] programs designed specifically to bring under-represented populations into science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oied.ncsu.edu/divweb/msa/peer-mentor-program/|title=Think and Do The Extraordinary|website=oied.ncsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet has brought university alumni closer to graduating students. Graduate university alumni are engaging with current students in career mentorship through interview questions and answers. The students with the best answers receive professional recommendations from industry experts build a more credible CV.

=== Instructional coaches ===

Instructional coaches are former teachers or principals that have shown effectiveness in their work of teaching or leading and go through additional training to learn more about the technical skills needed to be an effective coach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of coaching: effective strategies for school transformation|last=Aguilar|first=Elena|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2013|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''The Art of Coaching'', Elena Aguilar recommends that a coach "must have been an effective teacher for at least five years."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though skills that were effective in the classroom are a must, the coach must also be confident in working with adults, bringing strong listening, communication, and data analysis skills to the coaching position.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ultimately, an instructional coach is a former teacher who was successful in the classroom and is respected in the field, with the respect carrying over into this new position.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piic.pacoaching.org/index.php/piic-coaching/what-is-an-instructional-coach|title=What is an Instructional Coach?|last=Dupree|first=Orlena|website=piic.pacoaching.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activities ====
Coaches seek to work one-on-one with teachers or in a small group setting with teachers to build student achievement in the classroom based on data collected and discussed by both teacher or coach.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to Melinda Mangin and KaiLonnie Dunsmore, instructional coaching models may include: "cognitive coaching, clinical supervision, peer coaching and mentoring, formal literacy coaching, informal coaching, or a mixed model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Promoting quality assurance in literacy instruction: The preparation, inquiries and practices of literacy professionals|last=Bukowiecki|first=E.|publisher=New Foundations|year=2012|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have described categories of coaching such as data-oriented, student-oriented, managerial, and coaches who work with individual teachers or with groups of teachers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Coach" can mean many things: Five categories of literacy coaches in Reading First|last=Deussen|first=T.|last2=Coskie|first2=T.|last3=Robinson|first3=L.|last4=Autio|first4=E.|publisher=U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance|year=2007|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangin|first=Melinda M.|last2=Dunsmore|first2=KaiLonnie|date=2014-05-14|title=How the Framing of Instructional Coaching as a Lever for Systemic or Individual Reform Influences the Enactment of Coaching|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013161X14522814|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=51|issue=2|pages=179–213|doi=10.1177/0013161x14522814}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, coaching roles are designed to increase teacher capacity and push teacher improvement through learning opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The practice of instructional coaching is embedded within the work of a teacher, not in isolation of their everyday teaching.  In other words, the coach works with the teacher throughout the school year and meets during the school day with the teacher regarding current lessons, planning, and the observations/data collected.  The discussions between the instructional coach and teacher are built upon mutual respect and a trusting relationship through confidentiality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Overall, instructional coaching is meant to serve as professional development for the teacher(s).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A coach's main responsibility in this way is to change practice and build knowledge on "new instructional materials, programs, and initiatives" with the teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This professional development can come through discussion, but also can come in other forms.  Instructional coaches can model lessons and instructional strategies in the teachers' classroom to show examples and have teachers feel more confident in using these strategies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Instructional Coaching: A Partnership Approach to Improving Instruction|last=Knight|first=J.|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teacher observations is one of the most powerful ways that coaches can put data for change in front of teachers.  Coaches doing observations and collecting data to debrief with teachers helps paint a picture for teacher improvement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Effectiveness ====
According to a three-year research study done by the Pennsylvania Institute for Instructional Coaching, there was an increase in student success when instructional coaching was used in the classroom.  This, however, could not be viewed as solely "instructional coaching" in isolation of other factors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://piic.pacoaching.org/images/PIICdocuments/Research_and_Eval/piic_report_abstract.pdf|title=Instructional Coaching and  Student Outcomes: Findings from a Three Year Pilot Study|last=Medrich|first=E.A.|last2=Fitzgerald|first2=R.|date=2013|website=|access-date=March 20, 2017|last3=Skomsvold|first3=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coaching "model emphasizes the simultaneous use of four strategies: one-on-one teacher engagement; evidence-based literacy practices applied across the curriculum; data analytics; and reflection on practice."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Yet, teachers have shared that:

* Ninety-one percent of teachers coached regularly stated that coaches helped them understand and use new teaching strategies.
* Seventy-nine percent of teachers coached regularly said that their coach played a significant role in improving their classroom instruction and practice.
* Teachers who were regularly coached one-on-one reported that:
** They made significant changes in their instructional practice.
** Their students were more engaged in the classroom and enthusiastic about learning.
** Attendance increased dramatically in their classes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to this, "the most effective professional development model is thought to involve follow-up activities, usually in the form of long-term support, coaching in teachers' classrooms, or ongoing interaction with colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=D. L.|date=1996|title=Teacher Learning and the Mathematics Reforms:  What We Think We Know and What We Need to Learn|url=|journal=The Phi Delta Kappan|volume=77|pages=500–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, instructional coaching can provide this support and meet this definition of effective professional development.

===== Administrative support =====
There should also be support from administration around the instructional coaching to align the work of the coach and teacher with the school's mission or vision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Knight focuses on the partnership with the principal being at the core of successful coaching.  Knight explains that the principal and the instructional coach need to be aligned in their goals for the coaching occurring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  If they have differing desired outcomes for teaching, then the teacher will be receiving mixed messages and caught between improvement and a standstill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Aguilar suggests that coaches continually ask about the school's goals as well as action steps to meet these and bring into daily coaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Data-driven strategies =====
In conjunction with this partnership and observations, Knight's belief of data usage is critical for teacher improvement during coaching sessions.  Knight shares how giving opinions and telling a teacher how to improve stops the learning for the teacher and instead creates a barrier between the coach and teacher and makes the teacher expect hand-holding.  Instead, the data needs to tell a story for the teacher to determine moves to try to improve.  This allows ownership for the teacher as well as understanding of their work in conjunction with the work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Relationship building =====
The relationship and trust between the coach and coachee are a critical component of coaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  A coach having specific content knowledge and respect in a teacher's field of teaching would help build trust. Another way to build this trust is through confidentiality.  By keeping all conversations confidential and sticking to that, the coachee knows that your word is good.  In addition to relationship building, it is important to let the coachee feel comfortable talking to you about anything—there may need to be the time when a crisis they are facing trumps conversation about the lesson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Starting a coaching conversation about how life is going for a coachee is also important to relationship building.

===== Content and pedagogical knowledge =====
According to Nelson and Sassi, "knowledge of pedagogical process and content knowledge must be fused" in both understanding teaching and observing teaching.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Barbara Scott|last2=Sassi|first2=Annette|date=2016-06-29|title=Shifting Approaches to Supervision: The Case of Mathematics Supervision|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00131610021969100|journal=Educational Administration Quarterly|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=553–584|doi=10.1177/00131610021969100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, an instructional coach that is working with a math teacher should know "current mathematics education reform efforts are built on the notion that the ideas in a subject, and the ways in which students and teachers work with the ideas, matter."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shulman|first=L.|date=1986|title=Those who understand: Knowledge growth in teaching. Educational Researcher|url=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=57|pages=4–14|doi=10.3102/0013189x015002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It seems clear that a deep pedagogical knowledge as well as deep content specific knowledge are required for the teacher to have confidence in the coach and for the coach to be able to step in and assume the role of the teacher.

Knowledge that coaches need to be effective span just content and pedagogical knowledge.  Aguilar uses the ladder of inference to allow coaches to evaluate their own thoughts, and ultimately use this ladder to help principals and teachers evaluate their own beliefs before jumping to assumptions. Aguilar states that her "list of beliefs has changed over the years. You can change yours, too.  The point is to be mindful of the beliefs from which we're working and to notice the effect of working from those beliefs." Beliefs can change about approaches to teaching, classroom management, or even content knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Blended mentoring==
Blended mentoring is an implementation of information technology (IT) into the traditional mentoring program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celia|first=Argente-Linares, Eva{{!}}Pérez-López, M. Carmen{{!}}Ordóñez-Solana,|date=2016/00/00|title=Practical Experience of Blended Mentoring in Higher Education.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1127848|journal=Mentoring &amp; Tutoring: Partnership in Learning|language=en|volume=24|issue=5|issn=1361-1267}}&lt;/ref&gt;, intended to give to career counseling and development services the opportunity to adopt mentoring in their ordinary practice.

==Reverse mentoring==
In the reverse mentoring situation, the mentee has less overall experience (typically as a result of age) than the mentor (who is typically older), but the mentee has more knowledge in a particular area, and as such, reverses the typical constellation. Examples are when young internet or mobile savvy [[millennial generation]] teens train executives in using their high end [[smartphone]]s. They in turn sometimes offer insight in business processes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Business mentoring==
The concept of mentoring has entered the business domain as well. This is different from being an [[apprentice]]; a business mentor provides guidance to a business owner or an [[entrepreneur]] on the entrepreneur's business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271908|title=10 Places to Find Mentors and Advisors for Entrepreneurs|last=DeMers|first=Jayson|date=2016-03-17|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-06-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An apprentice learns a trade by working on the job with the "employer".

A 2012 literature review by EPS-PEAKS investigated the practice of business mentoring, with a focus on the [[MENA|Middle-East and North Africa region]].&lt;ref&gt;Pompa, C. (2012) [http://partnerplatform.org/?dk6sxm5w Literature Review on enterprise mentoring]. [http://partnerplatform.org/eps-peaks EPS-PEAKS] query response.&lt;/ref&gt; The review found strong evidence to suggest that business mentoring can have real benefits for entrepreneurs, but highlights some key factors that need to be taken into account when designing mentoring programmes for this to be the case, such as the need to balance a formal and informal approach and to appropriately match mentors and mentees.

'''Microlearning''' deals with relatively small learning units and short-term learning activities. The term is used in [[e-learning]] and related fields in the sense of [[learning]] processes in mediated environments. Microlearning is a holistic approach for skill based learning and education which deals with relatively small learning units. It involves short-term-focused strategies especially designed for skill based understanding/learning/education. Microlearning refers to micro-perspectives of learning, education, training and skill development. The approaches followed for assessment of microlearning are multidimensional &amp; holistic in nature and need based in particular cases [Patil U.K., 1999] [Patil U.K., 2000]. An ideal instructional approach for many situations especially in higher education for skill development, trainability and employability of learners/students [Patil U.K., 2002]. The technique is capable enough to address challenges associated with slow learners [Patil U.K., 2005]. This learning technique is versatile not only for skill based education but also for sustainable socioeconomic development. Without taking care of micro-perspectives in the context of learning, education, training and skill development, a skill based education cannot be imparted effectively [Patil U.K., 2009].

In a wide sense, microlearning can be understood as a metaphor which refers to micro aspects of a variety of learning models, concepts and processes.
{{quote|"No matter if learning refers to the process of building up and organizing [[knowledge]], to the change of [[behaviour]], of [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], of [[values]], of mental abilities, of [[cognitive]] structures, of emotional reactions, of action patterns or of societal dimensions, in all cases we have the possibility to consider micro, [[wikt:meso-|meso]] and [[macroscopic|macro]] aspects of the various views on more or less persisting changes and sustainable alterations of performances." (Hug 2005, p. 4).}}
Depending on frames and domains of reference, micro, meso and macro aspects vary. They are relational concepts. For example, in the context of language learning, one might think of micro aspects in terms of vocabularies, phrases, sentences, and distinguish them from situations and episodes (meso aspects) and socio-cultural specifics or complex semantics (macro aspects). In a more general discourse on learning, one might differentiate between the learning of individuals, group learning or learning of organizations and the learning of generations or societies.

Furthermore, microlearning marks a transition from common models of learning towards micro perspectives on and the significance of micro dimensions in the process of learning. The microlearning approach is an emergent [[paradigm]], so there are no hard definitions or coherent uses of the term yet. However, the growing focus on microlearning activities can be seen by [[World Wide Web|web]] users' activities on the subject, who [[tag (metadata)|tag]] their corresponding [[weblog]] postings and [[social bookmarking|social bookmarks]] with the term "microlearning".

As an [[instructional technology]], microlearning focuses on the design of microlearning activities through micro steps in digital media environments, which already is a daily reality for today's [[knowledge workers]]. These activities can be incorporated into learner's daily routines and tasks. Unlike "traditional" e-learning approaches, microlearning often tends towards [[push technology]] through [[push media]], which reduces the [[cognitive load]] on the learners. Therefore, the selection of micro [[learning object]]s and also pace and timing of microlearning activities are of importance for didactical designs.

Microlearning, in a nutshell, is a digital learning experience designed to be effective, engaging and enjoyable. Microlearning provides bite-sized learning content in stark contrast to the traditional model of learning and thus engagement follows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.masteroapp.com/ Master-O - Gamified Microlearning Platform.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
Microlearning can be characterized as follows:
* Microlearning processes often derive from interaction with [[microcontent|micro-content]], which takes place either in designed (media) settings (e-learning) or in emergent micro-content structures like weblog postings or social bookmark managers on the [[World Wide Web]] (Mosel 2005).
* Microlearning can be an assumption about the time needed to solve a learning task, for example answering a question, memorizing an information item, or finding a needed resource (Masie 2006). Learning processes that have been called "microlearning" can cover a span from few seconds (e.g. in mobile learning) up to 15 minutes or more. There is some relation to the term [[microteaching|micro-teaching]], which is an established practice in teacher education. 
* Microlearning can also be understood as a ''process'' of subsequent, "short" learning activities, i.e. learning through interaction with micro-content objects in small timeframes. In this case, the design, selection, feedback and pacing of repeated or otherwise "chained" microlearning tasks comes into view.
* In a wider sense, microlearning is the way more and more people are actually doing informal learning and gaining knowledge in micro-content, [[micromedia|micro-media]] or [[human multitasking|multitasking]] environments ([[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]), especially those that become increasingly based on [[Web 2.0]] and [[wireless]] technologies. In this wider sense, the borders between microlearning and the complementary concept of [[microknowledge|micro-knowledge]] are blurring.

==Dimensions==
The following dimensions can be used to describe or design microlearning activities:
* '''Time:''' relatively short effort, operating expense, degree of time consumption, measurable time, [[subjective time]], etc.
* '''Content:''' small or very small units, narrow topics, rather simple issues, etc.
* '''Curriculum:''' small part of curricular setting, parts of modules, elements of informal learning, etc.
* '''Form:''' fragments, facets, episodes, "knowledge nuggets", skill elements, etc.
* '''Process:''' separate, concomitant or actual, situated or integrated activities, iterative method, [[attention management]], awareness (getting into or being in a process), etc.
* '''Mediality:''' print media, electronic media, mono-media vs. multi-media, (inter-)mediated forms, etc.
* '''Learning type:''' repetitive, activist, reflective, pragmatist, [[Concept|conceptualist]], constructivist, [[Connectivism|connectivist]], behaviorist; also: [[action learning]], classroom learning, corporate learning, etc.
(Hug 2005, used with permission)

==Subscription learning==
"Subscription learning, as its name implies, provides an intermittent stream of learning-related interactions to those who are subscribed. These learning-related interactions—called "nuggets"—can involve a great variety of learning-related events, including content presentation, diagnostics, scenario-based questions, job aids, reflection questions, assignments, discussions, etc. [[Learning nugget|Nuggets]] are short, usually presented in less than five to ten minutes. Nuggets are intentionally scheduled over time to support learning, often utilizing research-based findings related to the spacing effect. Learners subscribe (or are subscribed) to one or more series of learning nuggets, called "threads". Learning threads can be predesigned, selecting nuggets based on anticipated learner needs or they can be dynamically created based on learner performance." (Thalheimer, 2013).

Subscription learning characteristics:
* Learners subscribe or are subscribed to a series ("threads") of short informational interactions ("nuggets").
* Interactions usually last less than five or ten minutes.
* Learners usually receive these nuggets through some form of push technology.
* Subscription-learning threads are usually—and preferably—designed using the scientific find known as the spacing effect. (Thalheimer, 2013).

==Examples of activities==
* reading a paragraph of [[writing|text]], [[e-mail]] or [[short message service|sms]]
* listening to an informational (short) [[podcast]] 
*watching a short video clip
* viewing a [[flashcard]]
* memorizing a word, vocabulary, definition or formula
* sorting a set of (micro-content) items by chronological order
* selecting an answer to a question
* answering questions in quizzes
* playful learning with micro-games
* composing a [[haiku]] or a short poem
*writing or drawing a reflection on just-viewed content
*rating confidence in an answer to a question 

==Applications (examples)==
* Screensavers which prompt the user to solve small series of simple tasks after a certain amount of inactivity
* Quizzes with [[multiple choice]] options on [[cell phones]] by use of [[short message service|sms]] or mobile applications ([[java platform|java]] [[midlet]]s, [[symbian]])
* Word of the day as daily [[RSS (file format)|RSS]]-feed or [[e-mail]]
* Flashcard-software for memorizing content through [[spaced repetition]]
* Short videos (2-10) minutes either presented stand alone or in a series

== Process of solving ==
It involves identifying  relationship, similarities and differences between shapes and patterns, recognizing visual sequences and relationship between objects and remembering this. It enables the ability to analyze and solve complex problems without relying upon or being limited by [[language]] skills As these tests don't require reading they can give insight into the abilities of those who have problems with reading and [[thinking]] verbally.

The '''North East National Board of School Education''' ('''NENBSE'''), is the Board of Education for [[Private education|private education]], under the Government of ASSAM. It was established by the S.R. Acts XXI of 1860 of the [[Government of India]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nenbseresults.co.in/ |title=North East National Board of School Education |publisher=nenbseresults.co.in |date=2012-02-19 |accessdate=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide education inexpensively to remote areas. The NENBSE is a national board that administers examinations for Secondary and Senior Secondary examinations of schools.

It had an enrollment of about thousands students from 2008–2012 at Secondary and Senior Secondary levels and enrolls about thousand students annually which makes it the largest private schooling system in the India.

Sheldon and his colleagues helped spread object teaching across America by utilizing in-service and pre-service teacher education, a practice school, and education of teacher educators, at a time when most of these things were new.

A '''parentocracy''' is a system in which a child's education must conform to the wealth and wishes of parents rather than the abilities and efforts of the pupil,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 1990:65&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to a [[meritocracy]], which distributes educational and financial rewards according to abilities and efforts. Parentocracy is a [[sociological]] concept that reflects [[political ideology]], and has influenced the organization of schools since the 1988 Education Reform act.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Fundamentally, the parents have dominating rights and choice in education regardless of means.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Since the [[Education Reform Act 1988|1988 Education Reform Act]], social policy has created a relationship between parents and schools in the UK, which is characterised by the [[principles of marketization]]. It is argued that parents are now primarily seen as educational consumers, whose choices determine the type of education their child receives. For example, a parent's choice to live in the [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] for a particular school potentially determines that child’s educational success. This idea{{ndash}}that parents are consumers through marketization{{ndash}}is countered by obligations and restrictions. The capacity to exercise choice is limited by social class, both on economic grounds and cultural capital, e.g., the actual cost of moving into an catchment area with a desirable school.

Sociologists Fulcher and Scott say that in a parentocracy, '''Resources + Preferences = Choice.'''{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} As Ball, et al. says, not everyone has the same resources to make the same decisions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} For example, middle class parents are more likely to pay for tutoring for their child to pass exams, while working class may have the same intention but cannot. Ball also discusses how marketization only ‘appeared’ to create a parentocracy, by providing equal right to education and letting parents choose which they want their child to attend.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Sharon Gerwitz explored this, writing that middle class parents have more economic and cultural capital than working class parents, and this lets them take advantage of the choices available.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} They can send their children to schools they desire by having the ability to afford travel expenses, and that they can move into a catchment area easier than that of a working-class family. She also noted how middle class parents socialised their children into attending church just to get their children into schools considered reputable. This shows how, as Ball, et al. says, wealth largely determines the extent of choice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Despite the argued inequality and lack of choice, many factors counter-act this. For instance labour policies included things such as education action zones to improve choices. Education action zones supposedly identify areas considered deprived so that they could be improved through additional resources. A recently approved proposal raises the school leaving age to 18.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This increases parentocracy as it helps student of all backgrounds receive a higher education, as opposed to the previous age, 16, which restricted many students and families.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Another policy, EMA, also encourages more choice, as it enables students from a low income family ( e.g., working class) to have education equal to those from any class or ethnicity by providing an educational maintenance allowance that helps students stay in school past 16. Witty does think that the EMA policy helps keep working class students continue past 16, but he thinks that higher education fees stops them going further.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As witty shows, fees are important in education, especially considering types of schools such as private schools, which require fees for admission, and even explored fees in higher education, such as universities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Educationalists believed that a meritocracy would foster 'equality of opportunity' in education, breaking down some of the social class barriers that restrict people with fees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Brown, however, suggests that we are now entering a 'third wave' in the history of schooling, moving away from the 'ideology of meritocracy' to a new ''ideology of parentocracy''. This is driven by a belief in parental rights, and strongly favours the philosophy of market principles in education.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Choice breeds competition—but if schools must compete for reputation, choices may actually become limited as popular schools cannot expand, so they become increasingly selective.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The big school lottery programme explores this, providing statistical evidence that out of 830 appeals of parents who didn't get their choice for their child’s education, only 28 were successful and 95 per cent were dismissed all together.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Judd agrees with the views expressed by the programme, saying that between 25-50% of parents do not get their children into their choice of school.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This is similar to the fact that schools can opt out of government control. This elaborates how those who can afford it can choose a school with high admissions cost ( such as a private school), while those who cannot are restricted to limited to free or less expensive choices. Even expensive schools, however, can fail.

Additionally, By 2008, nearly 90% of secondary schools in England became specialist schools, providing a range of specialist options from business, engineering, or maths—to humanities, music, and art.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Raey says that marketization created growing inequalities in education among parents especially in relation to class, gender, and ethnicity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} With the introduction of ''parent contracts'', home and school contracts made parents responsible for students truancy, and put them at risk of fine, prosecution, or even prison.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The '''Rosetta Project''' is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to develop a contemporary version of the historic [[Rosetta Stone]] to last from 2000 to [[Timeline of the far future#Technology and culture|12,000]] AD; it is run by the [[Long Now Foundation]]. Its goal is a meaningful survey and near permanent archive of 1,500 [[language]]s. Some of these languages have fewer than one thousand speakers left. Others are considered to be dying out because government centralization and [[globalization]] are increasing the prevalence of [[English language|English]] and other major languages. The intention is to create a unique platform for [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research and education, as well as a functional linguistic tool that might help in the recovery or revitalisation of lost languages in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/2012-03-24/3903626 The Rosetta Project], Presented by Maria Zijlstra on Lingua Franca, 24 March 2012, ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/02011/03/07/dr-laura-welcher-the-rosetta-project-the-language-commons/ Dr. Laura Welcher – The Rosetta Project &amp; The Language Commons], March 7th, 2011, by Austin Brown, Blog of the Long Now&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is creating this broad language archive through an open contribution, open review process similar to the strategy that created the original ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.  The resulting archive will be publicly available in three different media: a [[HD-Rosetta]] micro-etched [[nickel]] [[alloy]] disc three inches (7.62 cm) across with a 2,000 year life expectancy; a single volume monumental reference book; and a growing online archive. &lt;!-- I thought the metal was going to be [[Monel]]; did they change it, or did whoever write this not know the name/that we have an article on it? --&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:World population spoken languages.svg|thumb|200px|Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages (in red) are predicted to disappear in the next century]]

Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages are predicted to disappear in the next century, many with little or no significant documentation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Much linguistic description, especially the description of languages with few speakers, remains hidden in personal research files or poorly preserved in under-funded archives.

As part of the effort to secure this critical legacy of linguistic diversity, the Long Now Foundation plans a broad online survey and near-permanent physical archive of 1,500 of the approximately 7,000 human languages.

The project has three overlapping goals:

# to create an unprecedented platform for comparative linguistic research and education
# to develop and widely distribute a functional linguistic tool that might help with the recovery of lost or compromised languages in unknown futures
# to offer an aesthetic object that suggests the immense diversity of human languages as well as the very real threats to the continued survival of this diversity

The 1,500-language [[corpus linguistics | corpus]] expands on the parallel-text structure of the original Rosetta Stone through archiving ten descriptive components for each of the 1,500 selected languages.

The goal is an [[Open-source software|open source]] "[[Linux]] of [[Linguistics]]"—an effort of collaborative online scholarship drawing on the expertise and contributions of thousands of academic specialists and native speakers around the world. The project is also organising formal archive research groups at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], the American [[Library of Congress]], and the American [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (and its offices in [[Dallas]]).

The resulting Rosetta archives are publicly available in three different media:

# a free and continually growing online archive, also available as a DVD;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/interactive/ |website=Rosettaproject.org |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a single-volume monumental reference book;{{cn|date=June 2018}}
# an extreme-longevity micro-etched disc.

A "Version 1.0" of the [[HD-Rosetta]] disc was completed on November 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/2008/11/03/macro-to-micro-etching/ Macro to micro etching], November 3rd, 2008, by Alexander Rose, The Long Now Foundation's Blog&lt;/ref&gt; The disc contains over 13,000 pages of information using over 1,500 languages,&lt;ref name="weardisk"/&gt; which can be read after magnifying by 650 times with a microscope.

In early 2017, the Rosetta Wearable Disk was released.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=This Necklace Contains All of the World’s Languages |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/necklace-contains-all-worlds-languages-180961876/ |website=Smithsonian.com (Smart News) |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed using a similar manufacturing process as the first edition of the Rosetta Disk, the main difference being that the final archive is about 2 cm in diameter, thus enabling wearing as an ornament on the human body. One side has instructions in eight different languages and scripts (Bahasa Indonesia, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Modern Standard Arabic, Spanish, Swahili, and Russian), and the other an archive of over 1000 human languages assembled in 2016. By November 2017, the initial run of 100 disks had all been sold, but new releases are planned.&lt;ref name="weardisk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosetta Wearable Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/wearable/ |website=The Rosetta Project: A Long Now Foundation Library of Human Language |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian School Defense Staff''' or '''Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools''' ({{lang-ru|Штаб защиты русских школ}}; {{lang-lv|Krievu skolu aizstāvības štābs}}) — movement in [[Latvia]] for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: [[Vladimir Buzayev]], [[Gennady Kotov]], [[Yury Petropavlovsky]], [[Miroslav Mitrofanov]], [[Mihail Tyasin]], [[Viktor Dergunov]], [[Vladislav Rafalsky]], for some time also [[Alexander Yuryevich Kazakov|Alexander Kazakov]] (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — [[Yakov Pliner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

==Aims of the movement==
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtab.lv/main.php?w2=about Штаб защиты русских школ, официальный сайт&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1091/original/cittaut.pdf?1326906351 Cittautiešu jauniešu integrācija Latvijas sabiedrībā izglītības reformas kontekstā.

[[File:Statsraad Lehmkuhl2.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Built in 1914 as [[Grossherzog Friedrich August]], a school training ship for the German merchant marine, the since 1921 Norwegian-owned [[Statsraad Lehmkuhl]] is one of the oldest sail training ships in service]]
From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when [[maritime nation]]s would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see [[Outward Bound]]), '''sail training''' provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water. 

== Background ==
By 1900 most commercial sailing vessels were struggling to turn a profit in the face of competition from more modern [[Steamboat|steam ships]] which had become efficient enough to steam shorter [[great circle]] routes between ports instead of the longer [[trade wind]] routes used by [[sailing ships]].

Ships were built larger to carry bulk cargoes more efficiently, their rigs were simplified to reduce manning costs and speed was no longer a premium. Owners shipped cargoes that were non-perishable so that their date of arrival (which steam ships had started to guarantee) were of less importance. Finally as the [[Panama Canal]] was opened, sailing ships were used in parts of the world where steam ships still found it hard to operate: principally on 
*the [[Chile]]an [[nitrate trade]] (for fertilizers and explosive production in Europe), and on
*the Australian [[grain trade]].
Both Chile and Australian ports were difficult to supply with coal for steamships to refuel. Also, both routes to Europe went round [[Cape Horn]].

The end of the First World War saw a brief return to profitability as all ship types were in scarce supply due to wartime losses but that boom became bust as many new [[steam ships]] were built to replace the sailing ships that were lost.

== Genesis in the 1930s ==
[[File:Amerigo vespucci 1976 nyc aufgetakelt.jpg|thumbnail|[[Italian navy]] training ship ''[[Italian training ship Amerigo Vespucci|Amerigo Vespucci]]'', launched in 1931.]]

While many countries of the world operated sailing ships as [[school ship|training vessels]] for officers in their [[Merchant marine|Merchant Marine]] in the 1920s and 30s, several sailing ship owners such as [[Carl Laeisz]] and [[Gustaf Erikson]] determined that there was still a profit to be made from the last of the sailing ships.  

Erikson purchased existing ships that required the minimum of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] investment and repaired them with parts cannibalised from other ships. Identifying the bulk cargo routes that would still offer paying freights, he manned the ships with a smattering of paid experienced officers.  

Some of the deckhands were [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]] from steamship lines and other adventurous youth who had paid a premium to sail while being trained, some recruited for very modest salaries. The apprentices were considered trainees and were the first formalization of sail trainers with crew drawn from members of the public who just went for the adventure, as opposed to a career.  

With manning costs netted out on Erikson's balance sheet, the ships continued to return a paper [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. However Erikson was under no illusions as to the long term profitability of his venture, which depended on ignoring the [[depreciation]] on his ships and a shrinking supply of sound [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] and [[Rigging|rigs]]. The company would use their profits to diversify into steam after World War II. While the shipping companies of Erickson and [[F. Laeisz]] gradually turned to [[steam engine|steam]], the next generation of captains were climbing up the [[hawsehole]] and taking command of their own vessels, redefining sail training as a purely educational endeavour with trainees as the cargo.

From 1932 through 1958, [[Irving Johnson]] and his wife [[Electa Johnson|Electa "Exy" Johnson]] [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world 7 times with amateur youth crews on board their vessels named ''Yankee''. Over the years, their voyages were featured in books they authored, and in [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] magazines and TV specials like ''"Irving Johnson, High Seas Adventurer"''. Their archives are at [[Mystic Seaport]], Connecticut.  

Australian [[Alan Villiers]] purchased the old school ship ''George Stage'' from Denmark in 1934.  Renaming her the ''[[Joseph Conrad (ship)|Joseph Conrad]]'', he sailed her round the world with no paying cargo and a crew of youth who had paid to be there.  He also took as many non-paying youth as he could afford to fit in the budget, those he considered at risk on the streets of their inner cities and in need of what was then called "character building".  These trips were the genesis of current modern sail training, using manually operated ships and the harsh discipline imposed by the sea to further personal development and taking those disadvantaged by circumstance to benefit from the experience.&lt;ref name="King1988"&gt;{{cite book

By the end of World War II, the numbers of traditionally rigged sailing ships left were dwindling and public interest waned. After the German school ship [[Niobe (schooner)|Niobe]] had sunk in 1932, killing 69, the loss of the ''[[Pamir (ship)|Pamir]]'' in 1957 and the ''[[Albatross (ship, built in 1920)|Albatross]]'' in 1961 drew further ill will and seemed to signal the end of an era.&lt;ref name="Parrott2004"&gt;{{cite book

== Modern sail training ==
[[File:Downhaul.jpg|thumb|Cadets man headsails sheets on the ''[[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|Eagle]]'']]
In what was conceived to be last great gathering of [[Square rig|square-riggers]] under sail, Bernard Morgan and Greville Howard persuaded a number of ship owners to join together in a sort of farewell salute in 1956, organizing a race from [[Torbay]] on the South Coast of England to race informally across the [[Bay of Biscay]] to [[Lisbon]] in [[Portugal]].  Five square rigged [[school ship]]s entered the race, Denmark's ''[[Danmark (ship)|Danmark]]'', Norway's ''[[Christian Radich (ship)|Christian Radich]]'' and ''Sorlandet'', Belgium's ''Mercator'' and Portugal's first ''[[Sagres (ship)|Sagres]]''. The vessels would meet again the following year and every year since in an annual series that would astonish its original organizers today. Old vessels were saved or repaired and new purpose built sail training vessels were commissioned. With renewed interest in the age of sail, national sail training associations affiliated to [[Sail Training International]] (STI) (formerly "Sail Training Association") were organized and large summer events find upwards of 100 ships racing across the oceans.

Crew exchanges allow young people from one country to sail with those from another. Long before the end of the [[Cold War]], ships from [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] (which in some cases had been built in Germany) joined the International Fleet in 1974. A limited exchange between the [[Eastern bloc|East]] and West was initiated. One of the largest of the affiliate organizations of the STI is the [[American Sail Training Association]] (ASTA). Founded in 1973 with a handful of vessels, it has since grown to encompass an international organization with more than 250 tall ships representing 25 different countries. The UK National Member of STI is the Association of Sail Training Organisations (ASTO) Founded in 1972, http://www.asto.org.uk

Square rigged seamanship was in danger of becoming a lost art. As the 1997 restoration of the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] neared completion, the [[United States Navy]] called on the crew of [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tallshipbounty.org/the-ship/RobinWalbridge.php | title = TallShipBounty.org | accessdate = 11 October 2010 | quote = The highlight of his career, however, is the two years and over 15 voyages spent training the crew of "Old Ironsides," the U.S.S.

Many boats are historical vessels and replicas which require coordinated manual labor to sail, operating in the original tradition proposed by Alan Villiers and Irving Johnson such as the ''[[Picton Castle (ship)|Picton Castle]]'' while others are purpose built educational platforms carrying out scientific research under sail such as the ''[[Robert C. Seamans (ship)|Robert C. Seamans]]'' and the ''[[Corwith Cramer (ship)|Corwith Cramer]]'' of the [[Sea Education Association]]. Another new direction is the development of floating maritime heritage centres, connected to a sail training organisation, and often in co-ordination with land based maritime museums. [[Tall Ship Atyla]] is one such example of this, with visitors to the Bilbao Maritime Museum enjoying free entry to the ship during the winter months when she is moored nearby.  As the crew of the ''[[Irving Johnson (Tall ship)|Irving Johnson]]'' and the award winning program at the Los Angeles Maritime Institute like to say ''"We do not train youth for a life at sea ... we use the sea to educate youth for life"''.

== Vessel classifications ==
[[Tall ship]]s have been found to be effective platforms for sail training as they combine many elements fundamental to sail training.
A "Tall ship" is not a strictly defined type of vessel. "Tall ship" is commonly used today to define a large, traditionally rigged vessel, whether or not is it technically a ship.  For example, the [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|USCGC ''Eagle'']] is technically a [[barque]] and not a [[full rigged ship]].  A tall ship is usually defined by the topmast and [[topsail]]s she carries as opposed to the modern high aspect ratio rigs and [[Bermuda rig|marconi mains]] carried by the [[sloop]]s and [[yawl]]s seen in every harbor today.

For the purpose of classification and race rating, the STI divides Tall ships into the following classes :

:'''Class A''': All vessels over 160 feet in length overall, regardless of rig, and [[square rig]]ged vessels over 120 feet in length.
:'''Class A; Division II''': All square rigged vessels less than 120 feet in length.
:'''Class B''': [[Fore-and-aft rig|Fore-and-aft]] rigged vessels between 100 feet and 160 feet in length
:'''Class C''': All other fore-and-aft rigged vessels at least 30 feet long at the [[waterline]].

The [[United States Coast Guard]] classifies vessels based on their intended use and structure, prescribing requirements for  [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] and crew manning, waters the vessel may operate in, number of passengers allowed and minimum safety equipment required.

With the exception of uninspected vessels, all such vessels are inspected annually and issued a Certificate of Inspection (COI) which must be displayed on the vessel and spells out the requirements that vessel must maintain. 

:'''Sailing School Vessel (SSV)''':  Inspected under Title 46, Subchapter R of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  An SSV is a vessel of less than 500 gross tons carrying six or more sailing school students or instructors, primarily propelled by sail, and operated by a nonprofit educational organization exclusively for the purpose of sailing education.

:'''Passenger Vessel''': Certified according to the size and number of passengers (not engaged in educational activities or in the operation of the vessel) carried under Title 46 of the CFR.
::'''Subchapter C''': Uninspected vessels which operate with no more than six passengers.
::'''Subchapter T''': Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than six passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::'''Subchapter K''': Small passenger vessels of under 100 gross tons that carry more than 150 passengers and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.
::'''Subchapter H''': Passenger vessels of more than 100 gross tons that carry passengers for hire and are required to pass regular USCG inspection of the ship and all onboard equipment.

:'''Attraction Vessel''': Certification is required whenever a vessel is open to public boarding or conducts dockside programs.  The vessel may be permanently moored to a pier, or it may be certified under one or more of the above subchapters, but the Attraction Vessel COI certifies its safety for dockside and visitation only.

:'''Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV)''': Certified under Subchapter U  of Title 46 of the CFR.  An ORV is a vessel employed exclusively in either oceanographic (saltwater) or limnologic (freshwater) instruction and/or research, and is not necessarily equipped for passengers or other non-professionals.

In the land ordinance, the ''township'' is not a [[civil township]] but a surveying unit: a six mile by six mile square, divided into 36 one square mile [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]]s. The one square mile ''Section 16'' is located near the center of the township.

In the Land Ordinance of 1785 provision was also made by land grant for higher education (the [[College Lands]]).

The Organization was created towards the end of October 1939 in [[Warsaw]] response to German [[Polish culture during World War II|closure of most Polish educational institutions and repressions against teachers]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;Josef Krauski, ''Education as Resistance: The Polish Experience of Schooling During the War'', in Roy Lowe, ''Education and the Second World War : studies in schooling and social change'', Falmer Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7507-0054-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vf7A7yiSqe8C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=schools+%22occupied+Poland%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=T8NrSdLVA6eGzgTZtf32CA#PPA130], M1 Google Print, p.128-138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buk&gt;Ewa Bukowska, [http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/15%20Article.htm '' Secret Teaching in Poland in the Years 1939 to 1945''], London Branch of the Polish Home Army Ex-Servicemen Association&lt;/ref&gt; To forestall the rise of a new generation of educated Poles, German officials decreed that Polish children's schooling should end after a few years of elementary education. [[Heinrich Himmler]] wrote in a May 1940 memorandum, "The sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic, nothing above the number&amp;nbsp;500; writing one's name; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the Germans... I do not think that a knowledge of reading is desirable."&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php|title = Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era|work = [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate = 2008-01-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130303110620/http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php|archivedate = 2013-03-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools were closed, some teachers were arrested and even executed during the purges of Polish [[intelligentsia]], in the remaining schools, [[curriculum]] was heavily censored, textbooks were confiscated, libraries closed.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;&lt;ref name=buk/&gt;

The Organization concentrated on the primary education.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; Over time, it expanded into secondary education.&lt;ref name=buk/&gt; It provided assistance to teachers in need, for example to the ones deported from the [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany]], or to the ones in hiding with arrest warrants.&lt;ref name=wiem/&gt; It provided assistance to the families of teachers who had been imprisoned or killed, or who were in hiding.&lt;ref name=wiem/&gt; It was also involved in the underground printing and distribution of textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3984950 Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska], Encyklopedia PWN&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Davies]] notes that the Organization undertook the education of a million children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes'', Oxford University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-19-925340-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=%22Secret+Teaching+Organization%22&amp;ei=sQNtSfCHJYvkywTV_tj3Cw Google Print, p.342]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in the Organization underground primary education; in 1944, its secondary school system covered 100,000 people and the university level courses, about 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Ryszard Czekajowski, [http://galaxy.uci.agh.edu.pl/~znp/historia/ton.htm Tajna edukacja cywilna w latach wojenno-okupacyjnych Polski 1939-1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organization cooperated closely with the [[Polish government in exile]] (by which it was subsidized&lt;ref name=buk/&gt;) and the [[Polish Underground State]].&lt;ref name=wiem/&gt; Its network covered the whole of Poland, roughly corresponding to the pre-war educational structure of the [[Second Polish Republic]],&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; and was most organized in the [[General Government]].&lt;ref name=wiem/&gt; Thousands of its members were arrested and killed by the Germans.

'''Technology integration''' is the use of technology tools{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in general content areas in education in order to allow [[students]] to apply [[computer skills|computer]] and [[technology]] skills to learning and problem-solving. Generally speaking, the [[curriculum]] drives the use of technology and not vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.com/articles/14141|title=Teachers of the 21st Century Know the What, Why, and How of Technology Integration|author= Jolene Dockstader|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Do We Need Technology Integration? |work=[[Edutopia]] |url=http://www.edutopia.org/teaching-module-technology-integration-why|date=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology integration is defined as the use of technology to enhance and support the educational environment. Technology integration in the classroom can also support classroom instruction by creating opportunities for students to complete assignments on the computer rather than with normal pencil and paper.&lt;ref name="techparticipation.blogspot.in"&gt;{{cite web|title=Using technology to increase student participation|url=http://techparticipation.blogspot.in/2009/09/technology-integration-definition.html|ref=article|date=September 1, 2009|work=techparticipation.blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Curriculum integration with the use of technology involves the infusion of technology as a tool to enhance the learning in a content area or multidisciplinary setting... Effective integration of technology is achieved when students are able to select technology tools to help them obtain information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, and present it professionally to an authentic audience. The technology should become an integral part of how the classroom functions—as accessible as all other classroom tools. The focus in each lesson or unit is the curriculum outcome, not the technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter7.asp|title=Chapter 7: Technology Integration, U.S. Department of Education|date=December 9, 2008|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Integrating technology with standard curriculum can not only give students a sense of power, but also allows for more advanced learning among broad topics. However, these technologies require infrastructure, continual maintenance and repair – one determining element, among many, in how these technologies can be used for curricula purposes and whether or not they will be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Jackson|first1 = Steven|last2 = Pompe|first2 = Alex|last3 = Krieshok| first3 = Gabriel|title = Things Fall Apart: Maintenance, Repair, and Technology for Education Initiatives in Rural Namibia|pages = 283–90|newspaper = Proceedings of the 2011 iConference|location = Seattle, Washington|date = 8–11 September 2011|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-4023-7_24|chapter = The Work to Make a Home Network Work|isbn = 978-1-4020-4022-1|citeseerx = 10.1.1.459.6466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the infrastructure required to operate and support technology integration in schools include at the basic level electricity, Internet service providers, routers, modems, and personnel to maintain the network, beyond the initial cost of the hardware and software.&lt;ref name="Grinter"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Grinter|first1 = Rebecca|title = Ecscw 2005|last2 = Edwards|first2 = W.

Standard education curriculum with an integration of technology can provide tools for advanced learning among a broad range of topics. Integration of [[information and communication technology]] is often closely monitored and evaluated due to the current climate of accountability, outcome based education, and standardization in assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kervin|first1 = Lisa|last2 = Mantei|first2 = Jessica|title = Supporting educators with the inclusion of technology within literacy classrooms: A framework for "action"|journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 43–54|date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology integration can in some instances be problematic. A high ratio of students to technological device has been shown to impede or slow learning and task completion.&lt;ref name="Yu"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Yu|first = Chien|title = The Integration of Technology in the 21st Century Classroom: Teachers' Attitudes and Pedagogical Beliefs Toward Emerging Technologies| journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom|volume = 5|issue = 1|pages = 6|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some, instances dyadic peer interaction centered on integrated technology has proven to develop a more cooperative sense of social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Mehan|first = Hugh|title = Microcomputers in Classrooms: Educational Technology or Social Practice|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 20|issue = 1|pages = 4–22|date = March 1989|jstor = 3195700|doi=10.1525/aeq.1989.20.1.05x1208l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success or failure of technology integration is largely dependent on factors beyond the technology. The availability of appropriate software for the technology being integrated is also problematic in terms of software accessibility to students and educators.&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt; Another issue identified with technology integration is the lack of long-range planning for these tools within the educative districts they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Anderson|first = L. S.|year = 1996|title = K–12 technology planning at state, district, and local levels|publisher = National Center for Technology Planning, Mississippi State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology contributes to global development and diversity in classrooms while helping to develop upon the fundamental building blocks needed for students to achieve more complex ideas. In order for technology to make an impact within the educational system, teachers and students must access to technology in a contextual matter that is culturally relevant, responsive and meaningful to their educational practice and that promotes quality teaching and active student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Song|first1 = Shin-Cheol|last2 = Owens|first2 = Emiel|title = Rethinking Technology Disparities and Instructional Practices within Urban Schools: Recommendations for School Leadership and Teacher Training|journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom |volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 23–36|date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'educational technology' was used during the post World War II era in the United States for the integration of implements such as film strips, slide projectors, language laboratories, audio tapes, and television.&lt;ref name="Coley"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Coley|first1 = R. DJ.|last2 = Cradler|first2 = J.|last3 = Engel|first3 = P. K.|title= Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools|series = Policy Information Report|pages = 1–67|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presently, the computers, tablets, and mobile devices integrated into classroom settings for educational purposes are most often referred to as 'current' educational technologies. It is important to note that educational technologies continually change, and once referred to slate chalkboards used by students in early schoolhouses in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The phrase 'educational technology', a composite meaning of technology + education, is used to refer to the most advanced technologies that are available for both teaching and learning in a particular era.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

In 1994 federal legislation for both the Educate America Act and the Improving America's School's Act (IASA) authorized funds for state and federal educational technology planning.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; One of the principal goals listed in the Educate America Act is to promote the research, consensus building, and systemic changes needed to ensure equitable educational opportunities and high levels of educational achievement for all students (Public Law 103-227).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants= Goals 2000: Educate America Act|vol= House of Representatives 1804 Amendment|reporter=U.S. Congress|opinion=103|date=8 February 1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr1804/text/ih}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the Telecommunications Act provided a systematic change necessary to ensure equitable educational opportunities of bringing new technology into the education sector.&lt;ref name="104th Congress"&gt;{{cite court|litigants= TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 – 110 STAT. 56.|vol=House of Representatives 1804 Amendment|reporter=U.S. Congress|opinion=104|date=8 February 1996|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/specialuses/commsites/documents/pl-104-104.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telecomm Act requires affordable access and service to advanced telecom services for public schools and libraries. Many of the computers, tablets, and mobile devices currently used in classrooms operate through Internet connectivity; particularly those that are application based such as tablets. Schools in high-cost areas and disadvantaged schools were to receive higher discounts in telecom services such as Internet, cable, satellite television, and the management component.&lt;ref name="104th Congress"/&gt;

A chart of "Technology Penetration in U.S. Public Schools" report states 98% percent of schools reported having computers in the 1995–1996 school year, with 64% Internet access, and 38% working via networked systems.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; The ratio of students to computers in the United States in 1984 stood at 15 students per 1 computer, it now stands at an average all-time low of 10 students to computer.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; From the 1980s on into the 2000s, the most substantial issue to examine in educational technology was school access to technologies according to the 1997 Policy Information Report for Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools. These technologies included computers, multimedia computers, the Internet, networks, cable TV, and satellite technology amongst other technology-based resources.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

More recently ubiquitous computing devices, such as computers and tablets, are being used as networked collaborative technologies in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Grinter" /&gt; Computers, tablets and mobile devices may be used in educational settings within groups, between people and for collaborative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Paul|last = Dourish|author-link = Paul Dourish|title = Where the action is|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[MIT Press]]|edition = 1st|year = 2001|page = 245|isbn = 9780262541787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices provide teachers and students access to the World Wide Web in addition to a variety of software applications.

==Technology education standards==

[[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS) served as a roadmap since 1998 for improved teaching and learning by [[educator]]s. As stated above, these standards are used by teachers, students, and administrators to measure competency and set higher goals to be skillful.

The Partnership for 21st Century Skills is a national organization that advocates for 21st century readiness for every student. Their most recent Technology Plan was released in 2010, "Transforming American Education: Learning Powered by Technology".&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-history|title=Technology Integration: A Short History|first=Suzie|last=Boss|date=8 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan outlines a vision "to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners that mirror students' daily lives and the reality of their futures. In contrast to traditional classroom instruction, this requires that students be put at the center and encouraged to take control of their own learning by providing flexibility on several dimensions."&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt;
Although tools have changed dramatically since the beginnings of educational technology, this vision of using technology for empowered, self-directed learning has remained consistent.&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt;

==Pedagogy==
The integration of electronic devices into classrooms has been cited as a possible solution to bridge access for students, to close achievement gaps, that are subject to the [[digital divide]], based on social class, economic inequality, or gender where and a potential user does not have enough cultural capital required to have access to information and communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = David | last = Buckingham|title = Beyond technology|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[Polity]]|year = 2007|page = 209|isbn = 9780745638812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several motivations or arguments have been cited for integrating high-tech hardware and software into school, such as (1) making schools more efficient and productive than they currently are, (2) if this goal is achieved, teaching and learning will be transformed into an engaging and active process connected to real life, and (3) is to prepare the current generation of young people for the future workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Larry|last = Cuban|title = Oversold and underused|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]|year = 2003|page = 256|isbn = 9780674011090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[computer]] has access to [[graphics]] and other functions students can use to express their creativity. Technology integration does not always have to do with the computer. It can be the use of the [[overhead projector]], student response clickers, etc. Enhancing how the student learns is very important in technology integration. Technology will always help students to learn and explore more.&lt;ref name="techparticipation.blogspot.in"/&gt;

=== Paradigms ===

Most research in technology integration has been criticized for being atheoretical and [[ad hoc]] driven more by the affordances of the technology rather than the demands of pedagogy and subject matter. Armstrong (2012) argued that multimedia transmission turns to limit the learning into simple content, because it is difficult to deliver complicated content through multimedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach that attempts to address this concern is a framework aimed at describing the nature of teacher knowledge for successful technology integration. The [[technological pedagogical content knowledge]] or TPACK framework has recently received some positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TPACK.ORG|url = http://www.tpack.org|website = www.tpack.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model that has been used to analyze tech integration is the [http://www.hippasus.com/rrpweblog/archives/2014/06/29/LearningTechnologySAMRModel.pdf SAMR framework], developed by Ruben Puentedura. This model attempts to measure the level of tech integration with 4 the levels that go from Enhancement to Transformation: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ruben R. Puentedura's Blog|url = http://hippasus.com/blog/|website = hippasus.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructivism ===

[[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]] is a crucial component of technology integration.  It is a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|learning theory]] that describes the process of students constructing their own [[knowledge]] through collaboration and [[inquiry-based learning]]. According to this theory, students learn more deeply and retain information longer when they have a say in what and how they will learn. Inquiry-based learning, thus, is researching a question that is personally relevant and purposeful because of its direct correlation to the one investigating the knowledge.
As stated by [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sk.com.br/sk-piage.html |author=Wanda Y. Ginn |title=JEAN PIAGET – INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructivist learning is based on four stages of cognitive development. In these stages, children must take an active role in their own learning and produce meaningful works in order to develop a clear understanding. These works are a reflection of the knowledge that has been achieved through active self-guided learning. Students are active leaders in their learning and the learning is student-led rather than teacher–directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Piaget's_Stages |title=Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development |publisher=Department of Educational Psychology and Instructional Technology, University of Georgia |author1=Kay C. Wood |author2=Harlan Smith |author3=Daurice Grossniklaus }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teachers use a constructivist approach in their classrooms assuming one or more of the following roles: facilitator, collaborator, curriculum developer, team member, community builder, educational leader, or information producer.

===Counter argument to computers in the classroom===

Is technology in the classroom needed, or does it hinder students' social development? We've all seen a table of teenagers on their phones, all texting, not really socializing or talking to each other. How do they develop social and communication skills? Neil Postman (1993) concludes: &lt;blockquote&gt;The role of the school is to help students learn how to ignore and discard information so that they can achieve a sense of coherence in their lives; to help students cultivate a sense of social responsibility; to help students think critically, historically, and humanely; to help students understand the ways in which technology shapes their consciousness; to help students learn that their own needs sometimes are subordinate to the needs of the group. I could go on for another three pages in this vein without any reference to how machinery can give students access to information. Instead, let me summarize in two ways what I mean. First, I'll cite a remark made repeatedly by my friend Alan Kay, who is sometimes called "the father of the personal computer." Alan likes to remind us that any problems the schools cannot solve without machines, they cannot solve with them. Second, and with this I shall come to a close: If a nuclear holocaust should occur some place in the world, it will not happen because of insufficient information; if children are starving in Somalia, it's not because of insufficient information; if crime terrorizes our cities, marriages are breaking up, mental disorders are increasing, and children are being abused, none of this happens because of a lack of information. These things happen because we lack something else. It is the "something else" that is now the business of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (1993). [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Postman/Articles/TECHNOS_NET.htm Of Luddites, learning, and life]. Technos Quarterly, 2(4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tools==

===Interactive whiteboards===
[[Interactive whiteboard]]s are used in many schools as replacements for standard whiteboards and provide a way to allow students to interact with material on the computer. In addition, some interactive whiteboards software allow teachers to record their instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neamb.com/professional-resources/benefits-of-interactive-whiteboards.htm|title=Interactive Whiteboards Enhance Classroom Instruction and Learning |agency= NEA Member Benefits |website= www.neamb.com|language=en |access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[virtual environment]]s are also used with interactive whiteboards as a way for students to interact with 3D [[virtual learning environment|virtual learning]] objects employing kinetics and [[haptic technology|haptic]] touch the classroom. An example of the use of this technique is the [[open-source]] project [[Edusim]].
*Research has been carried out{{Citation needed |date= August 2009}} to track the worldwide Interactive Whiteboard market by Decision Tree Consulting (DTC), a worldwide research company. According to the results, interactive Whiteboards continue to be the biggest technology revolution in classrooms, across the world there are over 1.2 million boards installed, over 5 million classrooms are forecast to have Interactive Whiteboards installed by 2011, Americas are the biggest region closely followed by [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], and Mexico's [[Enciclomedia]] project to equip 145,000 classrooms is worth $1.8 billion and is the largest education technology project in the world.
*Interactive whiteboards can accommodate different learning styles, such as visual, tactile, and audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadonline.com/App/InteractiveWhiteboard/Classroom.pdf |author=Alfred N. Basilicato |title=Interactive Whiteboards: Assistive Technology for Every Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive Whiteboards are another way that technology is expanding in schools. By assisting the teacher to helping students more kinestically as well as finding different ways to process there information throughout the entire classroom.

===Student response systems===
[[Student response systems]] consist of handheld remote control units, or response pads, which are operated by individual students. An infrared or radio frequency receiver attached to the teacher's computer collects the data submitted by students. The CPS (Classroom Performance System),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einstruction.com/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=News.display&amp;Menu=newsroom&amp;content=FormalPaper&amp;id=209 |title=The Classroom Performance System: The Overwhelming Research Results Supporting This Teacher Tool and Methodology |work=eInstruction |accessdate=20 September 2009 |date=April 30, 2003|first=Darrel W. |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; once set, allows the  teacher to pose a question to students in several formats. Students then use the response pad to send their answer to the infrared sensor. Data collected from these systems is available to the teacher in real time and can be presented to the students in a graph form on an LCD projector. The teacher can also access a variety of reports to collect and analyze student data. These systems have been used in higher education science courses since the 1970s and have become popular in K-12 classrooms beginning in the early 21st century.

[[Audience response|Audience response systems]] (ARS) can help teachers analyze, and act upon student feedback more efficiently. For example, with polleverywhere.com, students text in answers via mobile devices to warm-up or quiz questions. The class can quickly view collective responses to the multiple-choice questions electronically, allowing the teacher to differentiate instruction and learn where students need help most.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-research-tools-programs|title=Technology Integration Research Review: Additional Tools and Programs|first=Vanessa|last=Vega|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining ARS with peer learning via collaborative discussions has also been proven to be particularly effective. When students answer an in-class conceptual question individually, then discuss it with their neighbors, and then vote again on the same or a conceptually similar question, the percentage of correct student responses usually increases, even in groups where no student had given the correct answer previously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among other tools that have been noted as being effective as a way of technology integration are [[podcasts]], [[digital cameras]], [[smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[digital media]], and [[blogs]].

==Mobile learning==
[[Mobile learning]] is defined as "learning across multiple contexts, through social and content interactions, using personal electronic devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHWA_enIN649IN649&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=mobile%20learning | title = Mobile learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mobile device is essentially any device that is portable and has internet access and includes tablets, smart phones, cell phones, [[e-book reader]]s, and [[MP3 player]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/mobile-devices-learning-resource-guide?download=yes&amp;key=1364000111&amp;token=5c58fe7e330446f498435d5a11e1f125|title=Mobile Devices for Learning: What You Need to Know|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mobile devices become increasingly common personal devices of K-12 students, some educators seek to utilize downloadable applications and interactive games to help facilitate learning. This practice can be controversial because many parents and educators are concerned that students would be off-task because teachers cannot monitor their activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This is currently being troubleshooted by forms of mobile learning that require a log-in, acting as a way to track engagement of students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Benefits===
According to findings from four meta analyses, blending technology with face-to-face teacher time generally produces better outcomes than face-to-face or online learning alone. Research is currently limited on the specific features of technology integration that improve learning. Meanwhile, the marketplace of learning technologies continues to grow and vary widely in content, quality, implementation, and context of use.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Research shows that adding technology to K-12 environments, alone, does not necessarily improve learning. What matters most to implementing mobile learning is how students and teachers use technology to develop knowledge and skills and that requires training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-research-learning-outcomes|title=Technology Integration Research Review|author=Vega, Vanessa|date=February 5, 2013|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful technology integration for learning goes hand in hand with changes in teacher training, curricula, and assessment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23716387|title=Laptop programs for students|author1=Zucker, A.|author2=Light, D.|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5910|pages=82–85|year=2009|doi=10.1126/science.1167705|pmid=19119224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of teacher professional development is profiled in Edutopia's Schools That Work series on eMints, a program that offers teachers 200 hours of coaching and training in technology integration over a two-year span.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Markus, David|title=High-Impact Professional Development for Rural Schools|date=July 25, 2012|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stw-tech-integration-professional-development|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these workshops teachers are trained in practices such as using interactive whiteboards and the latest web tools to facilitate active learning. In a 2010 publication of Learning Point Associates, statistics showed that students of teachers who had participated in eMints had significantly higher standardized test scores than those attained by their peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

It can keep students focused for longer periods of time. The use of computers to look up information/ data is a tremendous time saver, especially when used to access a comprehensive resource like the Internet to conduct research. This time-saving aspect can keep students focused on a project much longer than they would with books and paper resources, and it helps them develop better learning through exploration and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huneycutt|first1=Timothy|title=Technology in the Classroom: the Benefits of Blended Learning|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/188/technology-in-the-classroom-the-benefits-of-b|website=National Math + Science Initiative|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project-based activities==
Definition: Project Based Learning is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge.

Project Based Activities is a method of teaching where the students gain knowledge and skills by involving themselves for the more period of time to research and respond to the engaging and complex questions, problems, or challenges. the students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging.The students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging, real, curriculum based and frequently relating to more than one branch of knowledge. Therefore, a well designed project based learning activity is one which addresses different student learning styles and which does not assume that all students can demonstrate their knowledge in a single standard way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Project-Based Learning Activity About Project-Based Learning|url=http://www.sun-associates.com/lynn/pbl/pbl.html|work=resources.sun-associates.com|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The project based learning activities involves four basic elements.
# An extended time frame.
# Collaboration.
# Inquiry, investigation and research.
# The construction of an artifact or performance of a consequential task.

==Examples of activities==

===CyberHunt===
The term "hunt" refers to finding or searching for something. "[[CyberHunt]]" means an online activity which learners use the internet as tool to find answers to the question's based upon the topics which are assigned by someone else. Hence learners also can design the CyberHunt on some specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Cyberhunt?|url=http://www.nmmu.ac.za/cyberhunts/whatisacyberhunt.htm|work=nmmu.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; a CyberHunt, or internet scavenger hunt, is a [[project-based learning|project-based activity]] which helps students gain experience in exploring and browsing the [[internet]]. A CyberHunt may ask students to interact with the site (e.g.: play a game or watch a video), record short answers to teacher questions, as well as read and write about a topic in depth. There are basically two types of CyberHunt: 
*A simple task, in which the teacher develops a series of questions and gives the students a [[hypertext]] link to the URL that will give them the answer.
*A more complex task, intended for increasing and improving student internet search skills. Teachers ask questions for students to answer using a search engine.

===WebQuests===
It is an inquiry oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by the learners which are drawn out by the internet/web. It is designed to use  learner 'time well', to focus on using information rather than on looking for it and to support the learners to think at the level of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. It is the wonderful way of capturing student's imagination and allowing them to explore in a guided, meaningful manner. It allow the students to explore issues and find their own answers.

There are six building blocks of webQuests:
# The introduction – capturing the student's interest.
# The task-describing the activities end product.
#The resources-web sites, students will use to complete the task.
# The evaluation-measuring the result of the activity.
# The conclusion-summing up of the activity.
[[WebQuest]]s are student-centered, web-based curricular units that are interactive and use Internet resources. The purpose of a webQuest is to use [[information]] on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to support the instruction taught in the classroom. A webQuest consists of an introduction, a task (or final project that students complete at the end of the webQuest), processes (or instructional activities), web-based resources, evaluation of learning, reflection about learning, and a conclusion.

=== WISE ===
The [[Web-based Inquiry Science Environment]] (WISE) provides a platform for creating inquiry science projects for middle school and high school students using evidence and resources from the Web. Funded by the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], WISE has been developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1996 until the present. WISE inquiry projects include diverse elements such as online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools, as well as links to relevant web resources.It is the research-focused, open-source inquiry-based learning management system that includes the student- learning environment project authoring environment, grading tool, and tool and user/ course/ content management tools.

=== Virtual field trip ===
A [[virtual field trip]] is a website that allows the students to experience places, ideas, or objects beyond the constraints of the classroom{{Why|date=August 2009}}.
A virtual field trip is a great way to allow the students to explore and experience new information. This format is especially helpful and beneficial in allowing schools to keep the cost down. Virtual field trips may also be more practical for children in the younger grades, due to the fact that there is not a demand for chaperones and supervision. Although, a virtual field trip does not allow the children to have the hands on experiences and the social interactions that can and do take place on an actual field trip. An educator should incorporate the use of hands on material to further their understanding of the material that is presented and experienced in a virtual field trip.It is a guided exploration through the www that organizes a collection of pre- screened, its thematically based web pages into a structure online  learning experience

=== ePortfolio ===
An [[ePortfolio]] is a collection of student work that exhibits the student's achievements in one or more areas over time. Components in a typical student ePortfolio might contain creative writings, paintings, photography, math explorations, music, and videos. And it is a collection of work developed across varied contexts over time. The portfolio can advance learning by providing students and/or faculty with a way to organize, archive and display pieces of work.

'''The Nova Project''', also known as '''Nova''', is a small public [[alternative school|alternative]] [[high school]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], operated by the [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle Public School District]]. Its goal is to be a "democratically governed learning community of broadly educated, creative, and independent thinkers who work collaboratively and demonstrate a high degree of individual responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;"School History - The Nova Project", http://www.novafolios.com/school-history&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==

Nova was founded by a group of students, parents and teachers in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Loveless, Douglas, Sullivan, Pamela, Dredger, Katie, Burns, Jim. ''Deconstructing the Education-Industrial Complex in the Digital Age'', p. 16-17. https://books.google.com/books?id=O5vgDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is multidisciplinary and project-oriented, with an emphasis on individualized learning contracts,&lt;ref&gt;Weinstock, Chuck, ''Learning Contracts: Facilitating Academic Change,'' p. 7. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED080107&lt;/ref&gt; internships and community service.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Joe; Febey, Karen. ''Smaller, Safer, Saner, Successful Schools'', p. 53-54. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED455680&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nova functions through student-run, teacher-supported "committees" that decide school budgeting, the hiring and review process of staff, orientation of new students, and cultural affairs. 

The grading system is competency-based and is credit/no credit with 80% mastery required for credit. Each student works with a coordinator to design a personal learning plan to graduate. Nova students have the option of creating "independent contracts" with their teachers to earn credit for extracurricular goals and activities they commit to. It is common for Nova students to co-teach classes with their teachers, generating curriculum and building facilitation skills in line with Nova's student-led philosophy. Like other Seattle Public Schools students, Nova students may participate in the [[Running Start]] program and take classes at a local [[community college]]. 

In early summer of 2009, Nova was relocated from the Mann Building to the Meany Middle School site, where it was co-housed with the World School. Nova returned to the newly remodeled Mann Building in 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">A '''three-part lesson''' is an [[inquiry-based learning]] method used to teach mathematics in [[K–12 (education)|K–12]] schools.

The three-part lesson has been attributed to John A. Van de Walle, a mathematician at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;{{cite web | last = Van de Walle | first = John A. | title = Reform Mathematics vs. The Basics: Understanding the Conflict and Dealing with It | publisher = Mathematically Sane | date = April 1, 2003 | url = http://mathematicallysane.com/reform-mathematics-vs-the-basics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite web | title = John Van de Walle Biography | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | url = http://www.nctm.org/resources/content.aspx?id=25082 | accessdate = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
===Getting started phase (10 to 15 minutes)===
The purpose is to cognitively prepare students for the math lesson by having them think about a procedure, strategy or concept used in a prior lesson.  Teachers determine what specific previous learning they wish students to recall, based on outcomes desired for that particular lesson.&lt;ref name="Sketch"&gt;{{cite web | title = Sketch of a Three-Part Lesson | publisher = Ontario College of Teachers | date = March 2010 | url = http://professionallyspeaking.oct.ca/march_2010/features/lesson_study/three-part.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of the teacher is to "get students mentally prepared to work on the problem".&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

[[Marian Small]], a proponent of a [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach to mathematical instruction, provides an example of an inquiry-based question from which a three-part lesson could be created: "one bus has 47 students in it; another has 38. How many students are on both buses?"&lt;ref name="small-2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Small | first = Marian | title = How Students Learn Math and What Math We Want Them to Learn | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2012 | url = http://www.nelsonbrain.com/content/9780176643461.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work phase (30 to 40 minutes)===
Students engage in solving math problems individually, in pairs, or in small groups, and "record the mathematical thinking they used to develop solutions".  Students then plan the strategies, methods, and concrete materials they will use to solve the problem.  The teacher will circulate and make observations about the ways students are interacting, and will note the mathematical language they are using as well as the mathematical models they are employing to solve the problem.  If a student is having difficulty, "the teacher might pose questions to provoke further thinking or have other students explain their plan for solving the problem".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Teachers are advised to be active listeners in this phase, and to take notes.  This is also a phase in which teachers can assess students.&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;  

===Consolidation and practice phase (10 to 15 minutes)===
In this final phase, the teacher oversees the sharing of solutions by students, and may employ other teaching techniques such as "math congress", "gallery walk", or "bansho".  If new methods and strategies were discovered by students during the work phase, the teacher will post these on the class's "strategy wall", or use them to develop an "anchor chart".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Teachers are not to evaluate students in this phase, but should be actively listening "to both good and not so good ideas".&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt; 

==Effectiveness==
Advocates of the three-part lesson state that students develop "independence and confidence by choosing the methods, strategies and concrete materials they will use, as well as ways to record their solutions".  They claim students learn to discern similarities and differences in the mathematics, and also that "through such rich mathematics classroom discourse, students develop and consolidate their understanding of the learning goal of the lesson in terms of making connections to prior knowledge and experiences and making generalizations".&lt;ref name="Sketch"/&gt;  Advocates also claim "students are more enthusiastic about the subject" when inquiry-based math instruction is used.&lt;ref name="Alphonso"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Alphonso | first1 = Caroline | last2 = Morrow | first2 =   Adrian | title = Ontario Teachers Need Better Math Training, Minister Says | publisher = Globe and Mail | date = August 28, 2013 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/ontario-testing-shows-dip-in-student-math-skills-for-fifth-year-in-a-row/article13996303/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of inquiry-based methods such as the three-part lesson state that students are not learning the basics such as multiplication tables.  In Ontario, Canada, where the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]]  has promoted the three-part lesson, the curriculum was changed in the late 1990s in favour of "problem solving based on open-ended investigations rather than memorization".  In that province, test scores in grades three and grade six math declined between 2009 and 2013, and "some contend that the math curriculum rather than teacher education is to blame for the lower scores because it places more emphasis on real-world concepts and applications than on rote learning".&lt;ref name="Alphonso"/&gt;

A '''tutor''' is a person who provides assistance or tutelage to one or more people on certain subject areas or skills. The tutor spends a few hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to transfer their expertise on the topic or skill to the student. Tutoring can take place in different settings, such as a classroom, a formal tutoring center, or the home of the tutor/learner. As a teaching-learning method, tutoring is characterized by how it differs from formal teaching methods on the basis of the (in)formality of the setting as well as the flexibility in pedagogical methods in terms of duration, pace of teaching, evaluation and tutor-tutee rapport.

==History==
Tutoring began as an informal and unstructured method of educational assistance, dating back to periods in Ancient Greece. Tutors operated on an ad-hoc or impromptu basis in varied and unfixed settings wherein the main goal of the tutor was to impart knowledge to the learner in order to help the latter gain proficiency in the subject area. Methods of tutoring only began to become more structured after the 20th century through focus and specialisation in the training of tutors, application of tutoring, and evaluation of tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Ralph III, Michele M. Nobel, Terri Hessler, Christopher D. Yawn, and Timothy E. Heron. “Tutoring System Innovations: Past Practice to Future Prototypes.” ''Intervention in School &amp; Clinic'' 43, no. 2 (November 2007): 71–81. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/10534512070430020701&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 20th century onwards, with the rapid spread of mainstream education, the demand for tutoring has also increased as a way to supplement formal education.

==British and Irish secondary schools==

{{see also|Teaching assistant (United Kingdom)}}

In [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[secondary school]]s, ''form tutors'' are given the responsibilities of a [[form (education)|form]] or [[class (education)|class]] of [[student]]s in a particular year group (up to 30 students). They usually work in year teams headed by a year leader, year head, or guidance teacher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Form tutors will provide parents with most of the information about their child's progress and any problems they might be experiencing. Ordinarily, the form tutor is the person who contacts a parent if there is a problem at school; however, the year leader or guidance teacher may contact the parents, since the form tutor has full-time responsibility as a specialist subject teacher.

==Private tutoring in Asia==

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]] pointed out that private tutoring can dominate the lives of young people and their families, maintain and exacerbate social inequalities, divert needed household income into an unregulated industry, and create inefficiencies in education systems. It can also undermine official statements about fee-free education and create threats to social cohesion.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/news/adb-study-highlights-dark-side-shadow-education ADB Study Highlights Dark Side of 'Shadow Education'], Shadow Education: Private Supplementary Tutoring and its Implications for Policy Makers in Asia.&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, nearly 90% of elementary students receive some sort of shadow education.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Keun. 2010. "Educational Equality", in Lee, Chong Jae; Kim, Seong-yul &amp; Adams, Don (eds.), Sixty Years of Korean Education. Seoul: Seoul National University Press, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong, about 85% of senior secondary students do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klncc.caritas.org.hk/private/document/644.pdf], Caritas, Community &amp; Higher Education Service. 2010. Private Supplementary Tutoring of Secondary Students: Investigation Report. Hong Kong: Caritas.&lt;/ref&gt; 60% of primary students in West Bengal, India,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pratham.org/aser08/ASER_2010_Report.pdf.], Pratham. 2011. Annual Status of Education Report 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of secondary students in Kazakhstan receive private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Kalikova, Saule &amp; Zhanar Rakhimzhanova. 2009. "Private Tutoring in Kazakhstan", in Silova, Iveta (Ed.), Private Supplementary Tutoring in Central Asia: New Opportunities and Burdens.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for tutoring in Asia is exploding; by comparison globally, shadow education is most extensive in Asia. This is partly due to the stratification of education systems, cultural factors, perceptions of shortcomings in regular school systems, and the combination of growing wealth and smaller family sizes.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Therefore, the education sector has become a profitable industry which businesses have created different kinds of products and advertisement such us "the king/queen of tutorial", a usual advertisement tactic of Hong Kong tutorial centers that has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India where tutors achieve "celebrity-like status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Yojana|title=Meet the 'tutor kings and queens'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-20085558|accessdate=14 June 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, successful Southeast Asian tutors will even embrace the title of "tutor". Online private tutor matching platform and online learning platform offering online learning materials are other creations.

In Cambodia, most tutoring is provided by teachers,&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter"&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Mass Schooling in East Asia: Reflections of Inequality in Japan, South Korea, and Cambodia." Asia Pacific Education Review 11(1):14-24.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Hong Kong, it is provided by individuals, small companies or large companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/article/facing-shadow-education-system-hong-kong], Kwo, Ora &amp; Mark Bray. 2011. "Facing the Shadow Education System in Hong Kong." IIAS Newsletter (University of Leiden, International Institute for Asian Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolia, most tutoring is labor-intensive,&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Alison, Batjargal Ayush, Bolormaa Tsetsgee, &amp; Tumendelger Sengedorj. 2006. "Mongolia". In Iveta Silova, Virginija Būdienė, &amp; Mark Bray (Eds.), Education in a Hidden Marketplace: Monitoring of Private Tutoring. New York: Open Society Institute, pp.257-277&lt;/ref&gt; while entrepreneurs in South Korea make use of computers and other forms of technology.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

===Policy===

A 2012 study by the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong recommended policymakers across the region take a closer look at how ‘shadow education’ affects family budgets, children's time, and national education systems. It suggested that in order to reduce the need for private lessons, improvements in mainstream schools should be made. Regulations are also needed to protect consumers.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

==Costs of tutoring==

Some studies have estimated costs associated with "shadow education". In [[Pakistan]], expenditures on tutoring per child averaged $3.40 a month in 2011. In [[India]], average spending was lower, but still equated to about $2 per month.&lt;ref&gt;Aslam, Monazza &amp; Paul Atherton. 2011. "The "Shadow" Education Sector in India and Pakistan: The Determinants, Benefits and Equity Effects of Private Tutoring." Presentation at the UKFIET (United Kingdom Forum for International Education and Training) Conference, University of Oxford, 13–15 September.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, household expenditures for private tutoring at the secondary school level was $48 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;EPPM (International Institute of Education Policy, Planning &amp; Management). 2011. Study of Private Tutoring in Georgia. Tbilisi: EPPM, p.29. (In Georgian)&lt;/ref&gt;  In Hong Kong, the business of providing private tutoring to secondary schools reached $255 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Synovate Limited. 2011. Marketing survey of tutoring businesses in Hong Kong, cited in Modern Education Group Limited (2011), Global Offering (for stock market launch), Hong Kong, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a 2008 survey estimated the size of the private tutoring sector to be $6.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Vora, Nikhil &amp; Shweta Dewan. 2009. Indian Education Sector: Long Way from Graduation!. Mumbai: IDFC-SSK Securities Ltd., p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], families spent $12 billion in 2010 on private tutoring.&lt;ref name="DawsonWalter" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, where the government has attempted to cool down the private tutoring market, shadow education costs have continually grown, reaching a staggering $17.3 billion in 2010. Household expenditures on private tutoring are equivalent to about 80% of government expenditures on public education for primary and secondary students.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Sunwoong &amp; Ju-Ho Lee. 2010. "Private Tutoring and Demand for Education in South Korea." Economic Development and Cultural Change 58(2), p.261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the tutoring market is fragmented. Some online tutoring marketplaces, however, have managed to aggregate a large number of private tutors on their platform and also tutoring data. For example, one such site has over 34,000 registered tutors in California and made public their tutoring hourly rate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutoring Rates in California: An Analysis of over 34,000 Private Tutors|url=http://www.findtutorsnearme.com/tutoring-rates-in-california-an-analysis-of-over-34000-private-tutors/|publisher=www.findtutorsnearme.com|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

In many countries, individuals can become tutors without training. In some countries, including Cambodia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, and Tajikistan, the pattern of classroom teachers supplementing their incomes by tutoring students after school hours is more a necessity than a choice, as many teachers’ salaries hover close to the poverty line.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

In the Republic of Korea, the number of private tutors expanded roughly 7.1% annually on average from 2001 to 2006, and by 2009 the sector was the largest employer of graduates from the humanities and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Kyung-Min &amp; Daekwon Park. 2012. "Impacts of Urban Economic Factors on Private Tutoring Industry." Asia Pacific Education Review 13 (20), p.273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Private tutoring is not always effective in raising academic achievement; and in some schools students commonly skip classes or sleep through lessons because they are tired after excessive external study. This means that the shadow system can make regular schooling less efficient.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Teachers who spend more time focusing on private lessons than regular classes can cause greater inefficiencies in the mainstream school system. Situations in which teachers provide extra private lessons for pupils for whom they are already responsible in the public system can lead to corruption, particularly when teachers deliberately teach less in their regular classes in order to promote the market for private lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Walter. 2009. "The Tricks of the Teacher: Shadow Education and Corruption in Cambodia", in Heyneman, Stephen P. (ed.), Buying Your Way into Heaven: Education and Corruption in International Perspective. Rotterdam: Sense Publishers, pp.51-74; Bray &amp; Lykins (2012), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;

When private tutoring is provided by well trained tutor however the effects can be dramatic, with pupils improving performance by two standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. (1984). [http://web.mit.edu/bosworth/MacData/afs.course/5/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf "The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for Methods of Group Instruction as Effective as One-to-One Tutoring"], Educational Researcher, 13:6(4-16).
&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem]].

==Types of tutoring==

There can be an existing overlap between different types of tutoring with respect to the setting or location of tutoring, the size of tutor-learner pairings/groups, and the method of tutoring provided, for example, one-on-one peer tutoring can take place through online tutoring. Tutoring is typically private since it is exists independent of the system of public and private education, that is, one can be enrolled in public/private schooling and attend private tutoring services.

=== Academic coaching ===
Academic coaching is a type of mentoring applied to academics.  Coaching involves a collaborative approach. Coaches try to help students learn how they best learn and how to operate in an academic environment. Tutors help students learn the material in individual courses while coaches help students learn how to be successful in school. In college, that includes such topics as: [[study skills]], time management, stress management, effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, and understanding how to use a syllabus. Academic coaches meet with the student regularly throughout the semester. Coaches work with students in all kinds of situations, not just those who are struggling academically.  Academic coaching is also serves to help students prepare for entrance exams to gain entry to schools or universities, and it is a particularly popular in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/world/asia/06iht-educlede06.html|title=Tutoring Spreads Beyond Asia's Wealthy|last=Gooch|first=Liz|date=2012-08-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in India, a majority of students, be it of any class or stream, visit a coaching center or a "study circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/143827.cms|title=Hey tutors! Leave us kids alone|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home-based tutoring===
{{Main|In-home tutoring}}
[[In-home tutoring]] is a form of tutoring that occurs in the home. Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation. This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs. The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil. Due to the informal and private nature of in-home tutoring, there is limited substantial or conclusive information on in-home tutoring.

===Online tutoring===
{{Main|Online tutoring}}[[Online tutoring]] is another way for a student to receive academic help, either scheduled or on-demand. Sessions are done through an application where a student and tutor can communicate. Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing, online videos and other specialized applets which make it easier to convey information back and forth. Online tutoring has relatively recently emerged as a mechanism to provide tutoring services in contrast to more traditional in-person teaching. One of the potential drawbacks of online tutoring stems from the influx or sensory overload of information from different materials. "For example, mate- rial presented in multiple modalities run the risk of interrupting the learner from a coherent learn- ing experience, of imposing a “split attention” effect (the mind cannot concentrate on two things simultaneously), or of overloading the learner's limited supply of cognitive resources."&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, John, and Paul Chandler. “Why Some Material Is Difficult to Learn.” ''Faculty of Education - Papers (Archive)'', January 1, 1994, 185–233. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532690xci1203_1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peer tutoring ===
&lt;p&gt;Peer tutoring refers to the method of tutoring that involves members of the same peer group teaching or tutoring one another. The characteristics of a peer tutoring group/pairing vary across age, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity. It has been defined as "a class of practices and strategies that employs peers as one-on-one teachers to provide individualized instruction, practice, repetition, and clarification of concepts"&lt;ref&gt;Utley, C., Mortweet, S., &amp; Greenwood, C. (1997). Peer-mediated instruction and interventions. ''Focus on Exceptional Children'', ''29''(5), 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

=== Academic performance ===
Studies have found that peer tutoring provides academic benefits for learners across the subject areas of "reading, mathematics, science, and social studies"&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. 2018. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34 (1): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer tutoring has also been found to be an effective teaching method in enhancing the reading comprehension skills of students, especially that of students with a low academic performance at the secondary level in schools. Additionally, peer tutoring has been proven especially useful for those with learning disabilities at the elementary level, while there is mixed evidence showing the effectiveness of peer tutoring for those at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Alzahrani, Turkey, and Melinda Leko. “The Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Reading Comprehension Performance of Secondary Students With Disabilities: A Systematic Review.” ''Reading &amp; Writing Quarterly'' 34, no. 1 (January 2, 2018): 1–17. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2017.1302372&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effects ===
Although certain types of tutoring arrangements can require a salary for the tutor, typically tutoring is free of cost and thus financially affordable for learners. The cost-effectiveness of tutoring can prove to be especially beneficial for learners from low-income backgrounds or resource-strapped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Song, Yang, George Loewenstein, and Yaojiang Shi. “Heterogeneous Effects of Peer Tutoring: Evidence from Rural Chinese Middle Schools.” Research in Economics 72 (March 1, 2018): 33–48. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rie.2017.05.002&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, paid tutoring arrangements can create or further highlight socioeconomic disparities between low-income, middle-income and high-income populations. A study found that access to private tutoring was less financially affordable for low-income families, who thus benefited less from private tutoring as compared to high-income populations, who had the resources to profit from private tutoring.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Hsiao-Lei. “Private Tutoring, Wealth Constraint and Higher Education.” ''Pacific Economic Review'' 20, no. 4 (October 2015): 608–34. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0106.12122&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

=== Tutoring as "Shadow Education" ===
Tutoring has also emerged as a supplement to public and private schooling in many countries. The supplementary nature of tutoring is a feature in the domain of what some scholars have termed "shadow education".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bray, Mark. “Shadow Education: Comparative Perspectives on the Expansion and Implications of Private Supplementary Tutoring.” ''Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences'' 77 (April 2013): 412–20. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.03.096&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Shadow education has been defined as "a set of educational activities that occur out side formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student's formal school career."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David Lee, and David P. Baker. “Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan.” ''American Journal of Sociology'' 97, no. 6 (1992): 1639–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "shadow" has four components to it: firstly, the existence of and need for tutoring is produced by the existence of the formal education system; secondly, the formal education system is the mainstream system and thus tutoring is its shadow; thirdly, the focus remains on mainstream education in schools; fourthly, tutoring is largely informal and unstructured as compared to formal or mainstream education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting the Shadow Education System: What Government Policies for What Private Tutoring?|last=Bray|first=Mark|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|year=2009|isbn=978-92-803-1333-8|location=Paris|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of the popularity of shadow education, private tutoring can sometimes overshadow mainstream education with more priority given to enrolling in private tutoring centers. Mark Bray claims that "Especially near the time of major external examinations, schools in some countries may be perceived by pupils to be less able to cater for their specific needs."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">The '''Volvo effect''' is a term used in critiquing [[standardized testing]] that was created by Peter Sacks in his 2001 book ''Standardized Minds''. The term has been picked up by other sociologists, and counting [[Volvo cars|Volvos]] has even been facetiously proposed as an alternative method to the spending millions of dollars on standardized testing.&lt;ref&gt;For instance in ''The Unintended Consequences of High-Stakes Testing'' by M. Gail Jones, Brett D. Jones and Tracy Y. Hargrove.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original text in which the Volvo effect was advanced:

{{cquote|Although standardized tests have a relatively bleak record of predicting success in school and work, we know that they do tend to correlate exceedingly well with the income and education of one's parents. Call it the "Volvo Effect." The data is so strong in this regard that one could make a good guess about a child's standardized test scores by simply looking at how many degrees her parents have and what kind of car they drive.&lt;ref&gt;''Standardized Minds: The High Price of America's Testing Culture and What We Can Do to Change It'' by Peter Sacks, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7382-0433-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''World Oral Literature Project''' was ''"an urgent global initiative to document and disseminate endangered oral literatures before they disappear without record"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/ World Oral Literature Project].&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Dr [[Mark Turin]] and co-located at the [[University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], at the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Yale University]], the project was established in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/about/project.html About the World Oral Literature Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 2013 the organization ceased funding projects, whilst maintaining online resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.oralliterature.org/about/project.html | title = About : The Project | accessdate = 11 Sep 2018 | quote = From March 2013 the World Oral Literature Project will no longer be offering grants. We regret that from the end of March it will not be possible to accept collections or answer emails. However, online resources and archival material will continue to be available to the public through this website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The World Oral Literature Project provided small grants to fund the collecting of [[oral literature]], with a particular focus on the peoples of Asia and the Pacific, and on areas of cultural disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/grants/grants.html World Oral Literature Project Fieldwork Grants].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Project hosted training workshops for grant recipients and other engaged scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/research/workshops.html World Oral Literature Project Workshops].&lt;/ref&gt; The World Oral Literature Project also publishes oral texts and occasional papers, and makes collections of oral traditions accessible through online media platforms such as Cambridge Streaming Media Service and [[DSpace]].

==Activities==
===Research===
Fourteen funded oral literature fieldwork and documentation projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/grants/grantees.html Grantees], World Oral Literature Project.&lt;/ref&gt; were completed between 2009-2013.

===Online collections===
The World Oral Literature Project collected data gathered by grantees and anthropology fieldworkers as well as historic collections. This data is primarily audio and visual files that are either born digital or are digitised by the Project. This material is archived using [[DSpace]] and, where culturally appropriate, disseminated to the public through the World Oral Literature Project websites and streaming media services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/collections/collections.html World Oral Literature Project: Collections], World Oral Literature Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Database===
Researchers at the World Oral Literature Project have compiled a database of language endangerment levels, including references to collections and recordings of oral literature that exist in archives around the world. Data on language endangerment are drawn from the ''online Ethnologue'', the ''UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger'', and from a 'red list' compiled by Professor William Sutherland in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref name = db&gt;[http://www.oralliterature.org/research/databaseterms.html Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

However the project states ''The World Oral Literature Project does not take responsibility for the accuracy of the materials that our researchers have compiled from these three sources, and the Project does not have the staffing capacity to keep these resources up to date.''.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;

'''Worldware''' is a term coined by [[Steve Ehrmann]] to denote materials that are a) created and marketed mainly for purposes other than (just) teaching and learning, but which are also b) used for teaching and learning.  Examples of ''worldware'' include [[personal computer]]s, most [[word processor|word processing software]], and software used mainly for professional research.&lt;ref name="Ehrmann1995"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ehrmann  | first =Stephen C. |title=Asking the right question: what does research tell us about technology and higher learning? | journal = Change  | volume = 27  | issue = 2  | pages = 20–27  | year = 1995  | url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ503284&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ503284| doi = 10.1080/00091383.1995.9937734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Instructional Technology Primer: Worldware |publisher=Trinity College | url = http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/cc/documentation/fachbk/primer/4primer.html | accessdate = 2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and development of the idea ==

Ehrmann coined the term while leading the Valuable Viable Software (VVS) project of the Educom Software Initiative. Educom is now [[Educause]], and the Educom Software Initiative was a volunteer initiative created in the late 1980s by Steven W. Gilbert, then Educom's Vice President for Education. The goal of the VVS project was to find examples of software that had gotten into widespread, influential use in [[higher education|post-secondary]] teaching and learning. In the early decades of computer use, many educators and observers assumed that the best way to use computing to support learning was to create special purpose hardware and software for that purpose, e.g., tutorial software, even educational word processors (complete with instructional materials and feedback) and even computers created specifically for educational use.

The VVS project team studied more than two dozen software packages, looking for examples that had been both valuable (evaluations and experience indicated that the software-in-use could be of great educational value) and viable (i.e., the software had been in use by enough people and for enough years to influence educational practice). Most examples of valuable viable software that they found were either ''worldware'' or "student editions of ''worldware''." [[Minitab]], one of the software packages studied by the VVS Project, was an example of a student edition of worldware. It was designed to be very much like professional software, but easier to use and cheaper to purchase than its professional counterpart.  The VVS Project also found that student editions of ''worldware'' often evolved into ''worldware''; the easy-to-use, inexpensive software was used for professional purposes, too, especially by people who had learned using the original software.

The finding was a startling one: in the early 1990s, most people still assumed that the most important way to use computing to support learning was by designing elegant, powerful software to support learning (e.g., [[intelligent tutoring system|intelligent tutors]], simulations, branching pathways of instructional information).  But such software rarely seemed to last long enough to attain widespread use.  Typically, the VVS Project found, such software would become obsolete without ever achieving wide enough use to justify further foundation or publisher funding. The obsolescence occurred for many reasons, the most fast-acting of which was usually technical — changes in operating hardware and software often required an investment as large, or larger, than the original expenditure in order for the software to survive in the new environment.  This led to the observation that, "the bigger the grant funding the development of software, the smaller the chance for the software to thrive."

Another pitfall for such software lay in the publisher practice of making a gift of such software to faculty who adopted their textbooks.  Because no income stream was directly associated with the instructional software, the publisher usually had little motivation to upgrade the software.

== Advantages ==

Worldware (and student editions) had a number of advantages that rendered them more viable than typical instructional software:

* Their use in the professional world meant that students would often have heard of the worldware and would be motivated for professional reasons to learn to use it.
* Faculty often would have used the worldware in their own research or consulting.
* The large market helped fund the upgrade of the software; the funding of upgrades and training were not dependent on income from instructional uses.
* The large market also made it more likely that a successful worldware package would be integrated into a larger world of hardware and software. For example, when early instructional experiments made use of [[Visicalc]] (an early [[spreadsheet]]), faculty were not crippled when VisiCalc went out of existence. [[Lotus 1-2-3]] (another spreadsheet) could read the VisiCalc files. And if a faculty member then wanted to shift to [[Microsoft Excel]], those files could be read, too.  In contrast, when instructional software disappeared, all the instructor's work of curricular revision and skill development became useless.  Worldware could provide a foundation for incremental, cumulative curricular change and instructional improvement, a learning curve far less vulnerable to unexpected technical or business disruptions.&lt;ref name="kent-p"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://metric1.ma.imperial.ac.uk/articles/Worldware.html|title=Why we should be using 'worldware' in computer-based learning|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=CTI Maths &amp; Stats Newsletter|year=1995|issue=May|author=Phillip Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
