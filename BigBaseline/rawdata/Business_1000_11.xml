      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">An '''account manager''' is a person who works for a company and is responsible for the management of [[sales]] and [[Customer relationship management|relationships]] with particular [[customer]]s. An account manager maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The account manager does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the [[Customer|client]] of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one account manager throughout the duration of hiring the company. Account managers serve as the interface between the [[customer service]] and the [[sales]] team in a company.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The account manager serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Model_Job_Descriptions.html?id=z6R_uExfMGAC
 |title=Handbook of Model Job Descriptions |author =Barry.C|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key accounts''' provide the most business because they contain a small number of clients which contribute a large portion of the company's sales. According to research, sales from a company's key accounts have increased from 23% in 1975 to 60% currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130815025753/http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-08-15 |title=The Evolution of Key Account Management |author=Phill J. |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of an account manager can vary depending on the industry they work in, size of the company and nature of the business. Each [[customer account]] can vary in demands and an account manager may work with [[brand manager]]s for one account and a media department for another. Account managers usually report directly to the account director or agency director of the activity and status of accounts and transactions. An account manager may also manage a single account or a variety of accounts depending on the requirement of the company. Although the responsibility can vary between companies and between accounts, there are a shared set of common responsibilities which are as follows:

# Generate sales for a portfolio of accounts and reach the company's [[sales target]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Identify new sales opportunities within existing accounts to retain a client-account manager relationship by [[up-selling]] and [[cross-selling]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Manage and solve conflicts with clients&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; The Account Manager is expected to have specific information regarding daily operations of the Company and keep the Client updated.
# Interact and coordinate with the sales team and other staff members in other departments working on the same account&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Establish budgets with the client and company&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Meet time deadlines for accounts&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are situations in which an account manager, for example in advertising firms, is responsible for more than one account and therefore looks after multiple clients. When account locations do not overlap the account manager can be placed at the divisional, district, or territory level. When a sales team has a senior sales manager, the account manager coordinates sales accounts from other departments or specialties.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYKyKAxpUvwC&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Sales management: a global perspective |author1=Earl D. Honeycutt |author2=John B. Ford |author3=Antonis C. Simintiras |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, the sales team will work under the direct supervision of influencers and deciders instead of with a [[buyer]].&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

* '''Global account managers:''' Manage company accounts worldwide. This typically occurs in large companies with international accounts.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;
* '''National account managers:''' Manage numerous accounts nationwide. This typically occurs in medium to large companies when a company has multiple locations across the country.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

Global account managers and national account managers may work together in a hierarchical or matrix structure. The trend is to move responsibility for the major key accounts to the global level.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

==Key account manager==
Key account manager is assigned to a company headquarters to oversee the account team assigned to a particular account.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; Key account management includes sales but also includes planning and managing the full relationship between a business and its most important customers. An account manager who works in this role will engage in a variety of tasks including [[project management]], coordination, [[strategic planning]], [[relationship management]], negotiation, leadership and innovative development of opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YutAr0bk2OUC&amp;pg=PA294 |title=Key Account Plans |author1=Lynette Ryals |author2=Malcolm McDonald |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and keeping record of transaction of sale and purchase goods. The tasks may include working with [[product design]] and application, [[logistics]], sales support, and [[marketing]].

==Key account management models==
The basic assumption for a key account management model is the correct classification of the key accounts. A basic model often used in the period of 1950-1970 was the classification model of Webster. This model has been adapted by Milman and Wilson into a two-dimensional model and was paramount in the period of 1970-1990. Bensaou has tested this model empirically by his research of [[carmaker]]s in the [[Automotive industry in the United States|United States]] and [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japan]] and made revisions. De Blick synthesized the adaptations into the 4S-model, a key account classification model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor=Sloan Management Review volume 4 issue 4|title=Portfolios of buyer-seller relationships|author =M.Bensaou, |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, key account management spread to most B2B ([[business-to-business]]) models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Account_Management.html?id=QEwXt2F3GssC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Global Account Management |author =Peter C.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work environment==
Account managers can work for small or large companies either corporate, financial, retail, or government for instance.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Any company with a specific clients they conduct business with, can employ an account manager. Typical employers can be: 
#Direct marketing consultancies and agencies
#Marketing departments 
#Major commercial organizations

Account managers usually work in an office setting and can work more than 40 hours weekly. Travel is usually included in the job description. National or global account managers will very likely experience extra travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://davidmaister.com/articles/key-account-management/
 |title=Key Account Management |author =David.M|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
Although personality and an [[business acumen|aptitude for sales]] is key, a degree in business, marketing, or related field is typically required and depending on the nature of the account, a background in marketing or [[media studies]] may be preferred.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Due to each company having different requirements, it is important to obtain information from each potential company of employment.

'''Acuris''', formerly '''Mergermarket Group''' (Mergermarket Ltd.), is a media company that provides specialist news, research, analysis and data on financial markets. It is owned by [[BC Partners]], a private equity group. Singapore sovereign wealth fund [[GIC Private Limited]] has a minority stake.

The company has 1,300 staff, including 600 journalists and analysts, in 67 locations around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acuris.com/the-acuris-story|title=The Acuris Story|date=2017-05-17|work=Acuris|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with headquarters in London, New York and Hong Kong.

==History==
Acuris began with a single product, Mergermarket, which was established in December 1999 by founders Caspar Hobbs, Charlie Welsh and Gawn Rowan Hamilton. Its founding idea was that in the M&amp;A market, âThere is a lot of information out there but very little intelligence.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/army-major-cashes-in-on-mergermarket-sale-411135.html|title=Army major cashes in on Mergermarket sale|date=2006-08-09|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006 the company, then known as Mergermarket Ltd, was acquired by [[Financial Times|The Financial Times Group]] for Â£101m,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pearson.com/news/announcements/2006/august/pearson-acquires-mergermarket-adds-new-financial-content-and-serv.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pearson agrees to sell Mergermarket unit to BC Partners|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/396ca876-58e9-11e3-a7cb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3GCY5W3jb|accessdate=15 October 2014|agency=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|date=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; publisher of the Financial Times newspaper and FT.com. FT Group was a division of [[Pearson plc|Pearson PLC]], the international media group.

In 2013, the company was renamed to Mergermarket Group. In November 2013, Pearson agreed to sell Mergermarket Group to London[[private equity| private equity investor]] [[BC Partners]] in a transaction valuing the business intelligence and news service at Â£382m including debt. Based on the deal, Mergermarket Group was valued at [[EV/EBITDA|15 times its last year operating income]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/396ca876-58e9-11e3-a7cb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2piulFB00&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2014, [[Moody's Investors Service]] assigned a B3 corporate family rating to the Mergermarket Group.&lt;ref name="Moody's Rating Action: Mergermarket"&gt;{{cite news |title=Moody's assigns B3 CFR to Mergermarket; stable outlook |url= https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-B3-CFR-to-Mergermarket-stable-outlook--PR_290725?WT.mc_id=NLTITLE_YYYYMMDD_PR_290725 |date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the Mergermarket Group rebranded as Acuris. The announcement of this move fueled speculation that a sale of the company might come in the next year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityam.com/263372/mergermarket-rebrand-fuels-speculation-possible-sale&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, BC Partners sold a minority stake of around 30% to Singapore sovereign wealth fund [[GIC Private Limited|GIC]] in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://realdeals.eu.com/news/2017/07/03/bc-partners-sells-minority-stake-mergermarket-gic/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse''' (abbreviated '''AKB''' or '''AK Boerse''') is a [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Mannheim]] ([[Germany]]), focused on [[investment banking]], [[capital markets]], consulting and [[start-up companies]] within the [[financial technology]] sector. It is the oldest financial association lead by students in Germany and with over 1,000 members among the largest student organizations in Germany. The Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse is dedicated to connect students interested in financial markets associated with worldwide leading [[bank]]s and [[consulting firms]]. These include [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]], which are premium partners of Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse. It is organized first and foremost by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] but is receiving increasing support from students of other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== History ==
The Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse was founded in response to a perceived gap in the services provided by student societies at the [[University of Mannheim]]. Students interested in the [[stock exchange]] and [[financial markets]], that sought to actively participate in [[capital markets]] did not have the opportunity to do so whilst engaging on campus as no such opportunity had yet been offered. 
Therefore, a small group of students independently organized an evening event within the university with the aim of creating a platform for students interested in the financial markets . Supported by the University this group developed into a non-profit association which was registered by the city of [[Mannheim]] on November 6th 1984.

Corresponding with positive developments within financial markets, membership within the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse steadily grew to exceed 1,000 students within a few years. Through their stock market analysis and research papers the Arbeitskries BÃ¶rse rapidly became well throughout the [[Rhine-Neckar]] area, which led to leading global investment banks and consulting firms taking notice of the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse. At the [[University of Mannheim]] the lecture series "Semester Program of the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse" was established and the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse focused on building partnerships with financial institutions within the European financial hubs, London and Frankfurt in the following years. To satisfy external requests the "Kreis der Freunde und FÃ¶rderer des AKB" was founded in October 1988, an association that could be joined by everyone interested in the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse.

Today the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse is the largest finance association run by students in Germany and the largest student society at the [[University of Mannheim]]. The Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse still provides the same extensive semester program and within the framework of their lectures they attract renowned speakers from both the world's leading investment banks and consulting firms. While doing this the students of the [[University of Mannheim]] get the chance to develop business contacts at several networking events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/historie/|title= History of Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse|accessdate =2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
As a student initiative, the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse is mainly organized by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] in addition to several students from other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]]. In June, the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse annually appoints its new leading team and executive board. The team is made up of the heads of five resorts: member management, [[event management]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[marketing]] and social events. The executive board consists of five additional students who are responsible for resort management, [[finances]], working groups, semester programme, special events, contacts to the university, developments of the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse as an association, premium partners and other cooperation partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/team/|title= Team of Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse|accessdate= 2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse is supported by external partners, including [[Oliver Wyman]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] as well as the [[Mannheim Business School]] and alumni.

== Activities and semester program ==
The Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse attempts to form a direct link between the theoretical frameworks covered in academic studies and the practical application of these within a company. 
During each semester various events are organized on Mannheim's main [[campus]] - the [[Mannheim Palace]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg]], [[Germany]]. Firstly topical lectures are held by renowned individuals from within the financial or consulting industry, these have for instance included Armin von Falkenhayn, Head of Global Corporate and Investment Banking Germany at [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]; Dr. Marcus Schenk, [[Chief Financial Officer]] at [[Deutsche Bank]]: Christian Zorn, Head of Investment Banking Germany at [[Morgan Stanley]] and Frank Mattern, former [[CEO]] at [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]]. Occasionally representatives of other industries such as [[Kurt Bock]], [[CEO]] at [[BASF SE]], are invited to hold such lectures. Secondly, several company [[workshops]] as well as student work groups are conducted to support Mannheim students aspiring a career in the financial sector. Within these lectures, the various companies prepare case studies that provide insight into their structure and everyday work environment. Following these lectures, the audience is able to discuss specific topics with top tier personalities and get to know company recruiters as well as employees.

The companies that have held lectures or offered workshops during the past years in cooperation with the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse are - besides the premium partners [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]] - leading banks such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Commerzbank]], [[Fidelity]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Lazard]], [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]], [[UBS]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Leonardo &amp; Co.]] and [[Jefferies]], the central banks [[European Central Bank]] and [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] in addition to leading consulting firms such as [[Bain &amp; Company]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]], [[Roland Berger Strategy Consultants]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[L.E.K. Consulting]], [[strategy&amp;]]. Further cooperating companies are [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Perella Weinberg Partners]], Blackstone, [[3i|3I]], [[Fresenius]] and [[BASF SE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/events/archiv/|title=Event archives of Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lectures ===
In cooperation with several company partners the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse organizes an extensive lecture series every semester, composed of up to 12 company presentations and technical lectures concerned with current topics from the financial community and industry. To do so, companies from the fields of [[investment banking]], [[asset management]], [[consulting]] and [[auditing]] are invited to create a thought provoking presentation that explores various points of view. The lectures demonstrate relationships between the latest case studies and theoretical foundations from academia as well as findings from their business applications. At the following get-together with snacks and drinks students have the opportunity to get in personal contact with the speakers, to discuss specialist topics and ask questions regarding internships and career options.&lt;ref name="Startseite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/start/|title=akboerse.de|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshops ===
Similar to this, the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse, in cooperation with company partners organises numerous workshops every semester. Case studies offer a rare opportunity to gain better insight into specific business divisions and to analyse complex business matters. After the presentation of results, students come into contact with employees and are able ask specific questions and acquire information about a potential career within these companies. Getting to know preferences and strengths during the workshops makes it easier for a single business division or a certain enterprise to make a decision.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Working groups ===
Another task of the Arbeitskreis BÃ¶rse is to transmit knowledge in Excel and Bloomberg and to encourage active discussions with problems from the area of finance industry and management consultancy. Students can meet weekly to acquire and deepen fundamental knowledge in the respective subject areas under instruction from experienced Alumni to be optimally prepared for internships and entry into the workforce. To advanced students, a platform to discuss highly demanding problems is offered. The knowledge acquired in the working groups is indispensable for future entry into financial business.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Social events ===
During each semester, numerous social events take place, which promote cohesion among members and help familiarise students with recently joined fellow students as well provide a temporary escape from stressful university life. Thus the students become part of a large community that outlasts their time at university and allows Alumni to return to Mannheim annually.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7885">'''Asset stripping''' is a term used to refer to the practice of selling off a company's [[asset]]s in order to improve returns for equity investors.  With a lower level of assets, it is maintained, the business is rendered financially less stable or viable.  For example, the sale-and-leaseback of a building would lead to an increased rental bill for the company.

The proceeds of the sale of assets may be used to lower the company's net debt. Alternatively, they may be used to pay a dividend to equityholders, leaving the company with lower [[net worth]] â i.e. the same level of debt but fewer assets (and weaker earnings) to support that debt.

In many cases where the term is used, a financial investor, referred to as a '[[corporate raid]]er', [[takeover|takes control of]] another company and then auctions off the acquired company's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Asset-stripping|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally used in a [[pejorative]] sense as such activity is not considered helpful to the company.  Asset stripping has been considered to be a problem in economies such as [[Russia]] or [[China]] which are making a transition to being market economies.  In these situations, managers of a state-owned company have been known to sell the assets they control, leaving behind nothing but debts to the state.

==History==

Early innovators of asset stripping were [[Carl Icahn]], [[Victor Posner]], and [[Nelson Peltz]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Mark|title=King Icahn|date=May 2014|publisher=Createspace|page=4|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom were investors in the 1970s and 1980s. Carl Icahn performed one of the most notorious and hostile takeovers when he acquired [[Trans World Airlines]] in 1985. Here Icahn stripped TWA of its assets, selling them individually to repay the debt assimilated during the takeover. This particular corporate raid formed the idea of selling a company's assets in order to repay debt, and eventually increase the raider's net worth.

One of the biggest corporate raids that failed to materialize was the takeover of [[Gulf Oil]] by [[T. Boone Pickens]]. In 1984, Pickens attempted to acquire Gulf Oil and sell its assets individually to gain net worth. However, the purchase would have had been severely detrimental to [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]; a customer of Gulf Oil. Therefore, Chevron stepped-in and [[Merger|merged]] with Gulf Oil for $13.2 billion, which at that time was the biggest merger between two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mattera|first1=Phillip|title=Chevron: The Big Oil Boys|url=http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1992/04/mm0492_11.html |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[BC Partners]] acquired [[Phones 4u]] for a fee in the region of Â£700 million. At this point in time Phones 4u had already entered [[Administration (law)|administration]] and had deep financial struggles. However, this did not prevent BC Partners from taking a Â£223 million dividend in order to pay off some of its own debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-stripping by bosses finished Phones4U|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/39005/Asset-stripping+by+bosses+finished+Phones4U |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ownership of BC Partners, Phones 4u had very little [[Financial independence|financial freedom]] to expand and claim back the contract of EE. In September 2014 [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[Vodafone UK|Vodafone]] and [[Hutchinson 3G|Three]] decided to withdraw the rights for Phones 4u to sell their products. Due to the already poor financial situation of Phones 4u, the company has now no alternative but to sell its individual assets and close down. The net worth of Phones 4u's assets are estimated to exceed Â£1.4 billion, which provides BC Partners with the credit to pay off some of its debts and significantly improve its net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Partington|first1=Adam|title=Ex-Phones 4U employee: How the retailer fell down around our ears, and BC Partners forgot to say goodbye |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/exphones-4u-employee-how-the-retailer-fell-down-around-our-ears-and-bc-partners-forgot-to-say-goodbye-9787723.html |publisher=London Evening Standard|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Asset stripping is highly controversial topic within the financial world. The benefits of asset stripping generally go to the corporate raiders, who can slash the debts they may have whilst improving their net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinger|first1=Tejvan|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/asset-stripping/ |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, since asset stripping often results in thousands of employees losing their jobs without much consideration of the consequences to the affected community, the concept can be unpopular in the public sphere. One particular example of where asset stripping cost a significant number of workers their jobs was in the [[Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas|Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stutz|first1=Howard|title=Removal of Fontainebleau's construction crane signals doom for ill-fated Strip hotel|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/economy/removal-fontainebleau-s-construction-crane-signals-doom-ill-fated-strip-hotel |publisher=Stephens Media LLC|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the takeover, 433 people lost their jobs when assets were sold off and the company was stripped.

==In the United Kingdom==
The process of asset stripping is not an illegal practice. If a corporate raider sells the target companies assets individually and pays off its debts the [[financial regulator]]s have no room for investigation. However, some firms perform the process illegally and if found guilty may incur a substantial fine or even prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |publisher=Crown |accessdate=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030194421/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asset stripping by private equity firms in Europe is now regulated pursuant to the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]].

===Phoenixing===

This is one of two methods a corporate raider can use to strip assets illegally. For this method to work, the corporate raider and the targeted firm must have the same director. Assets of the targeted firm are transferred to the corporate raider to ensure they remain safe from debt collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/Fraud_Law/Asset_Stripping |publisher=Law on the Web|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process lets the corporate raider improve their net worth while leaving liabilities with the targeted company.

===Liquidation===

This method acts on completely fraudulent terms, and results in a higher punishment from the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). Here, corporate raiders take ownership of a company on hostile terms, transfer the assets to their name and then put the dilapidated firm into liquidation. This ensures that the corporate raider improves their net worth, and has no liability to deal with the firm recently placed into liquidation. In comparison to phoenixing, this method has the highest rate of jail sentences issued for those found guilty.

The '''Association for Business Communication''' ('''ABC''') is  a  [[learned society]] for the field of [[business communication]]. Its mission statement states: "The Association for Business Communication (ABC) is an international organization committed to fostering excellence in business communication scholarship, research, education, and practice". The organization is [[interdisciplinary]], with members belonging to academic fields such as [[management]], [[marketing]], [[English language|English]], foreign languages, [[public speaking|speech]], [[communication]], [[linguistics]], and [[information systems]]. Additionally the organization brings together university academicians, business practitioners, and business consultants.

==Organizational structure==
ABC is an international organization, divided into nine regional divisions (Europe, Asia and Pacific Rim, Caribbean and Central America, and five North American regions: Canada plus Eastern, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western United States), each with its own separate academic conferences. Each year, the association holds an International Conference in October or November. Midyear, regional conferences are heldâone in the European region and one or two of the North American regions. The Asia and Pacific Rim region holds a conference every two years or more frequently.

A [[board of directors]] and an [[executive committee]] lead the ABC. The board of directors is directly elected with a vice president elected from each of 9 regions and 12 directors at large, with staggered terms. The executive committee consists of a permanent position of executive director and four officers of the association. The members of the executive committee serve for four years in rotating capacity, beginning as second vice president in the first year, then first vice president the next, president the next, and past president the last year on the committee. The organization as a whole elects the second vice president position from among candidates on the board of directors.

The current executive director of the ABC is [[James M. Dubinsky]] ([[Virginia Tech]]). He took office in 2011.

For 2018-2019 the executive committee consists of President Lisa Gueldenzoph Snyder ([[North Carolina A &amp; T University]]), First Vice President Marcel Robles ([[Eastern Kentucky University]]), Second Vice President Geert Jacobs ([[Ghent University]]), and immediate Past President Deborah Roebuck ([[Kennesaw State University]]).

== Publications ==
Two [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]]s, ''[[International Journal of Business Communication]]'' and the ''[[Business and Professional Communication Quarterly]]'' are published by [[SAGE Publications]] on behalf of ABC.

== Standing committees, ad hoc committees and interest groups ==

The ABC has standing committees, as follow:

    Academic Environment
    Business Practices
    Conference Procedures
    C.R. Anderson Research Fund
    Diversity and Inclusion
    Employment Opportunities
    Graduate Studies
    International Issues
    Marketing and Membership
    Modern Language Association Liaison (MLA)
    Nominating
    Publications Board
    Research
    Student Competition
    Teaching
    Technology
    Undergraduate Studies

The ABC has ad hoc committees for interests that have not yet warranted a standing committee, but may in the future become so. Many of the standing committees began as ad hoc committees. In 2017, the ABC had these ad hoc committees:

    Finance Committee
    National Communication Association Liaison
    Proceedings Editorial Review Board
    Vision/Mission Review Committee

Additionally, ABC members pursue a number of professional objectives through voluntary interest groups. A Special Interest Group may be convened by the First Vice President or by membersâ current interest groups. In 2017, the ABC had the following Special Interest Groups:

    Business Writing and Speaking Centers
    Community College
    Consulting
    Intercultural Communication
    MBA
    Rhetoric
    Teaching with Technology


==History==

ABC was founded in 1936, beginning with a modest membership of 72 members, all but one from the United States (the only exception being from Canada). The organization, based at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], was then named the âAssociation of College Teachers of Business Writers.â The next year, 1937, that name changed to the âAmerican Business Writing Association.â

By the 1960s, the field had grown considerably and became heavily interested in areas well beyond business writing (such as oral presentations, negotiations, and nonverbal communication among others). In 1967, the Board of Directors voted to change the name of the organization to the âAmerican Business Communication Associationâ to reflect this change.

By the late 1970s, as the membership of the organization grew to include more members from outside the Americas and as the focus of research expanded heavily into the fields of intercultural communication and cross-cultural business communication practice, the term âAmericanâ became increasingly inaccurate of both the membership and focus of the organization. In 1985, the Board of Directors voted to change the name to its current âAssociation for Business Communication.â

In 1990, ABC moved its headquarters from [[Illinois]] first to the [[University of North Texas]] (1990â1994) and then to [[Baruch College]] [[CUNY]] in [[New York City]] (from 1994â2007) and then to [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]] (from 2007-2011). Presently, the ABC is headquartered at [[Stephen F. Austin State University]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">'''Available-to-promise''' ('''ATP''') is a business function that provides a response to customer order enquiries, based on resource availability.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, M.O. et al. (2004), "Available to Promise" in ''Handbook of Quantitative Supply Chain Analysis - Modeling in the E-Business Era'', Kluwer&lt;/ref&gt; It generates available quantities of the requested product, and delivery due dates. Therefore, ATP supports order promising and fulfillment, aiming to manage demand and match it to production plans.

Available-to-promise functions are IT-enabled and usually integrated in enterprise management [[software]] packages. However, ATP execution may need to be adjusted for the way a certain company operates.

== Classification ==
A fundamental distinction between ATP functions is based on the [[push-pull strategy]]. Push-based ATP is based on forecasts regarding future demand - based on anticipation of demand, ATP quantities and availability dates are computed. A prominent example is the traditional determination of ATP based on the [[Master Production Schedule]]. The push-based approach is fundamentally limited by dependence on [[forecasts]], which may prove inaccurate. Gross ATP represents the total available supply, and net ATP represents the supply remaining to support new demands, after existing commitments to customers have been accounted for.

Pull-based models, on the other hand, dynamically allocate resources in response to actual customer orders. This means that pull-based ATP is able to balance forecast-driven resource replenishment with order-triggered resource utilization,&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Z. (2005), "Optimization-based Available-to-promise with Multi Stage Resource Availability", Annals of Operations Research 135, 65-85&lt;/ref&gt; but because resources are allocated with each coming order, the process will yield myopic results.

== ATP Execution ==
ATP functions can be executed in real time, driven by each individual order, or in batch mode â meaning that at a certain time interval, the system checks availability for orders piled up in that period of time. The process is triggered by the need to check resource availability before making a commitment to deliver an order. For example, ATP calculation using SAP [[software]] depends on the level of "stock, planned receipts (production orders, purchase orders, planned orders and so on), and planned requirements (sales orders, deliveries, reservations, etc.)"

The '''Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT) Project''' is an [[open source software]] project that provides reporting and [[business intelligence]] capabilities for [[rich client]] and [[web application]]s, especially those based on [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Java EE]]. BIRT is a top-level software project within the [[Eclipse Foundation]], an independent [[not-for-profit]] consortium of software industry vendors and an [[open source community]].

The project's stated goals are to address a wide range of reporting needs within a typical application,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = BIRT Project Description and Scope| url = http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/project/description.php| accessdate = 2007-05-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070604013725/http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/project/description.php| archivedate= 4 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from operational or [[enterprise reporting]] to multi-dimensional online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]). Initially, the project has focused on and delivered capabilities that allow application developers to easily design and integrate reports into applications.

The project is supported by an active community of users at BIRT Developer Center and developers at the Eclipse.org BIRT Project page.

BIRT has two main components: a visual report designer within the [[Eclipse IDE]] for creating BIRT Reports, and a runtime component for generating reports that can be deployed to any Java environment. The BIRT project also includes a charting engine that is both fully integrated into the report designer and can be used standalone to integrate charts into an application.

BIRT Report designs are persisted as [[XML]] and can access a number of different data sources including [[Java Data Objects|JDO datastores]], [[JFire|JFire Scripting Objects]], [[POJO]]s, [[SQL]] [[Database management system|databases]], [[Web Services]] and XML.

== History ==

The BIRT project was first proposed and sponsored by [[Actuate Corporation]] when Actuate joined the Eclipse Foundation as a Strategic Developer on August 24, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Actuate Joins Eclipse Foundation as Strategic Developer and Board Member | url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/aug242004actuatepr.html | date=2004-08-24| work=Press Release | publisher=[[Eclipse Foundation]]| accessdate=2007-05-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609183919/http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/aug242004actuatepr.html| archivedate= 9 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was subsequently approved and became a top-level project within the Eclipse community on October 6, 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eclipse Foundation and Actuate Announce Approval of Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools Project | url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/oct62004birtpr.html | date=2004-10-06 | work=Press Release | publisher=[[Eclipse Foundation]]| accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project contributor community includes [[IBM]], and Innovent Solutions.

In 2007 [[Tivoli Software|IBM's Tivoli Division]] adopted BIRT as the infrastructure for its Tivoli Common Reporting (TCR) product. TCR produces historical reports on Tivoli-managed IT resources and processes.

The initial project code base was designed and developed by Actuate beginning in early 2004 and donated to the Eclipse Foundation when the project was approved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2458">A '''banishment room''' (also known as a '''chasing-out-room''' and a '''boredom room''') is a modern [[employee exit management]] strategy whereby employees are transferred to another department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Ida|title=Japanese companies using âbanishment roomsâ to push employees to resign|url=http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Japan Daily Press|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASAHI&gt;{{cite news|title=BANISHMENT ROOM: Top companies under investigation over unfair labor practices|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=THE ASAHI SHIMBUN|date=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TABUCHI&gt;{{cite news|last=TABUCHI|first=HIROKO|title=Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethicality of the practice is questionable and may be construed as [[constructive dismissal]] in some regions.

The practice, which is not officially acknowledged, is common in [[Japan]] which has strong labor laws and a tradition of [[permanent employment]].

'''Bleisure travel''' ('''UK''' /ËbleÊ.ÉÊ³/ '''US''' /ËbliË.ÊÉ/) is a [[portmanteau]] of â[[business]]â and â[[leisure]]â, and, it refers to âthe activity of combining [[business travel]] with leisure timeâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/author/cambridgewords|title=About words. New words â 1 January 2018|last=|first=|date=1 January 2018|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term bleisure was first published in 2009 by the Future Laboratory as part of their biannual Trend Briefing. The term was originally coined by writer and silent revolutionist, Jacob Strand, then a future forecaster working for The Future Laboratory. And co-written by journalist and futurologist Miriam Rayman.

In [[Corporate business travel|corporate business]] travel, extending a business trip for personal purposes is also known as âbizcationâ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/maximizing-the-value-of-641761817|title=Maximizing the value of conferences to communities: 'Bleisure Travel' and 'Bizcations' emerge with social media boosts.|last=Zak|first=Karen|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been studied from 2011, from this year on, a report shows that bleisure travel has been maintaining a constant growth, accounting for 7% of all business trips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.gbta.org/l/5572/2017-06-02/55l1xn|title=Extending business travel into leisure time â Bleisure study|last=Global Business Travel Association in partnership with Hilton|first=|date=June 2017|website=GBTA Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bleisure traveller profiles ==
Bleisure travellers can be described as âindividuals who combine leisure with professional business obligations when abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichy, McLeay|first=Jessica, Fraser|date=August 2017|title=Bleisure, motivation and typologies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318878088_Bleisure_Motivations_and_Typologies?enrichId=rgreq-0166c8432de1f7b171f9bd6a403e0082-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMxODg3ODA4ODtBUzo1MjMyMjc3MDI4NjE4MjRAMTUwMTc1ODYxMzY5Nw%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_3&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|volume=|pages=|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;â.

The elements characterising bleisure travellers are some and different, this make difficult to draw a defined profile of these individuals. Bleisure is a widespread practice among US travellers, especially for those working in [[Technology]], [[Health system|Healthcare]], [[Public administration|Public Administration]] sectors. A report shows that US traveller add bleisure to nearly half of the cases, precisely 52% for International trips and 42% for domestic ones. The main reasons for travelling would be [[conference]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[team building]], client meetings and [[presentation]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.advertising.expedia.com/influencing-bleisure-travelers|title=Profile of American bleisure traveller|last=Expedia Media Solutions and Luth Research|first=|date=6 December 2016|website=Expedia Media Solutions Blog|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travellers could be grouped according to various aspects, in particular [[gender]], [[Ageing|age]] and trip frequency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carlsonwagonlit.com/content/dam/cwt/pdf/insights/20160712-solutions-group-white-paper-bleisure.pdf|title=A quantitative look at the bleisure phenomenon|last=CWT Solutions Group|first=|date=July 2016|website=Carson Wagonlit Travel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research indicates that female business travellers would be more likely to take bleisure trips than male. In both groups 20% of travellers would take one or more bleisure trips in a year time, however women look to register higher rate: 8.5% against 6.8% of men.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this observation, CWT have looked at the average number of bleisure trips per bleisure travellers per year, this was roughly the same value for both genders (1.4). However, women take overall fewer business trips than men, on average. This difference in the total amount of business travel is responsible for the higher bleisure rate measured in the female population.&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger travellers (between 20 and 25) look significantly more likely to add weekends to their business trips, measuring a rate close to 15%. This result is two or three times higher than those for 45-50 age interval.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this finding, CWT calculated the average number of bleisure trips  in each segment. Across the age range 20 to 65, this varies from 1.3 to 1.5 bleisure trips/year. At the same time, the amount of total travel varies much more significantly (+2 trips/year), from the 20-25 to the 45-50 age interval. The larger denominator in the bleisure rate is thus responsible for the lower values observed in the 45-50 group. Interpretation: these results show that travellers appear to have fixed capacity for bleisure: when they do it, they take 1 or bleisure trips per year, almost irrespective of how much they travel. In other words, bleisure does not scale with the total amount of travel.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millennials]] travellers deserve a special attention because they appear to be the individuals shaping the future of business travel, nearly twice likely to travel for business than [[Baby boomers|Baby Boomers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could be attributed to their flexible attitude to life, which would lead to the blurring of the line between their private and professional life. Millennials seem to work often from home or during the evening hours, to dedicate leisure on-goings to traditional work hours. A consequence of this freedom could be their willingness to extend business trips including [[vacation]] activities. In comparison with other age group, Millennials look to be more likely to take bleisure trips, compared to older travellers. However, it is not clear whether this reflects unique preferences or transitory life events.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Do take more bleisure trips than other generations did in their 20s and 30s? Or will Millennials take much fewer bleisure trips in later years? It seems possible that Millennials are actually different. One observation in particular would reinforce this idea: When business travellers have children, they seem to be equally likely to extend their trip, compared to those who do not have them. This would suggest that, when Millennials will have families in greater numbers, they may still take bleisure trips&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent travellers taking 20 trips or more per year seem to be less than 5% likely to take a bleisure trip during the year, they would account for 8% of all bleisure trips. By contrast, one third of all bleisure trips would be taken by employees travelling once a month.

== Factors influencing the phenomenon ==
It seems evident that Millennials workers are increasingly demanding for bleisure from their work trip. Despite the state-of-the-art technology available nowadays, Millennials still prefer face-to-face meetings to get business done, therefore travel is still important for business companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.gbta.org/groups/reviews/item/20/11/2155|title=GBTA Business Traveler Sentiment Indexâ¢|last=GBTA Foundation|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travel looks as a good opportunity to save on travel expenses, mostly for those who do not take a lot of vacation: 66% of US business traveller spend more money on leisure activities because of the money they save on travel. 60% take bleisure trips because do not have a lot of regular vacations. To decide whether to turn a business travel into bleisure or not, employee takes into consideration travelling on exciting destinations, additional costs required to extend the trip, how close the trip is to the weekend, the number of night they must stay for business, how affordable the hotel is, whether they have friends or family in the area, whether they can bring friends or family along. The general trend would indicate the addition of one or two days as the most frequent option, only 23% of bleisure travellers would extend their trips for more than three days. In many cases leisure days equal (37%) or even exceed business days (42%). The length of business trip seems to be a crucial factor when considering extending the trip in 62% of cases. In particular, when business days are more than three, bleisure travellers are not only likely to extend the trip, but also to visit different cities in the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Advantages for employee and companies ==
For the [[Employment|employees]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/welcome-to-the-world-678428901|title="Welcome to the world of bleisure: the trend is growing of adding leisure time to the business trip."|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compromise between work [[duties]] and leisure time;
* [[Career development]].
* Possibility to bring family or friend with them; 
* Improvement of their [[well-being]];
For the companies:
* Improvement of the knowledge about the culture of the location theyâre visiting that would simplify business negotiations;
* Possibility to have happier and therefore more productive employees;
* Discounted rate offered by the hotels;
* Opportunity to recruit new workers and attempting to retain current ones.

== Main activities and destinations ==
The more likely bleisure destinations are cities offering a combination of different elements, which could allow the travellers to add leisure time to their business trip, such as sightseeing locations, [[Sports venue|sport venues]] and cultural events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The difference between the origin and the destination city seems to affect bleisure rates: in the case of domestic trips, the amount of bleisure is expected to be low because the two cities should be easily accessible and share similar culture. On the other hand, long intercontinental trips would offer the chance to know realities that are different from ordinary. Researches seem to confirm this trend: bleisure trips would account for 5.2% of the domestic trips and 9.7% of the international ones. The highest bleisure rate (18.4%) appears in international trips when the origin and destination cities are located in different geographical regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The top bleisure cities in [[United States|US]] are: [[Honolulu]] (above 20%), [[Miami]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Las Vegas]] (12-15%) [[New York City|NYC]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] (9-12%). In [[Europe]] rates looks lower, this could be due to the shorter domestic and continental routes: [[Lisbon]], [[Barcelona]], [[Nice]], [[Istanbul]] (8-11%), [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Moscow]], [[Rome]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[Madrid]] (6-8%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Corporate policy ==
Given that bleisure travel is a rising phenomenon, there is still no official regulation, therefore extending business trips for bleisure would have to be decided by [[management]] on a case-by-case basis. Some preventive measures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/the-atlas/bleisure-travel-policy/|title=American Express Global Business Travel|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be followed in advance to avoid misunderstanding.
* Companies have to differentiate between business and non-business amenities and declare what is willing to pay for; 
* Employees have to define when the business travel ends and when the leisure one starts;
* Company and employees must arrange a corporate travel insurance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Blindspots analysis''' (also '''blind spots analysis''') is a method aimed at uncovering obsolete, incomplete, or incorrect assumptions in a decision makerâs mental scheme of the environment. [[Michael Porter]] used the term "blind spots" to refer to conventional wisdom which no longer holds true, but which still guides business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porter Michael, E. |date=1980|title= Competitive Strategy|location= NY|publisher= Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further popularized by [[Barbara Tuchman]], in her book ''The March of Folly'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuchman, Barbara |date=1985|title= The March of Folly|location= NY|publisher= Ballantine Books |edition=Paperback }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe political decisions and strategies which were clearly wrong in their assumptions, and by other authors since, such as social psychologists [[Mahzarin Banaji]] and [[Anthony Greenwald]] in their study of [[prejudice]].

==Uncovering blind spots==
Ben Gilad fully developed, in his book, ''Business Blindspots'' (1994), the following three-step "Gilad method" for uncovering blind spots&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step One'': Conducting a [[Porter five forces analysis|Porterâs Industry Structure â aka 5 force analysis]] on a given industry or segment (market), augmented with identification of possible change drivers, which are defined as trends with the potential to have profound (structural) effect on the balance of power among the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step Two:'' Collecting [[competitive intelligence]] on the target companyâs top executives assumptions regarding the same industry structure as in Step One. Sources may include annual reports' letters to shareholders, autobiographies, interviews in the press, public appearances and speeches, industry meetings, congressional testimonies, conference calls with security analysts (transcripts are publicly available), and all other statements regarding vision and beliefs. An alternative technique is known among competitive intelligence professionals as âstrategyâs reverse engineeringâ which looks for the underlying assumptions which can rationalize existing strategy.
#''Step Three:'' Compare the results of Step Two with the analysis in Step One. Any contradiction with the analysis in Step One is a potential blindspot.

== Underlying assumptions ==

Underlying Blindspots Analysis is an assumption about the inherent [[cognitive bias|biases]] of decision making at the top of organizations (business, government or otherwise) exceeding those of their subordinates or outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liff, Stewart|author-link=Stewart Liff|title= The Complete Guide to Hiring and Firing Government Employees|pages= 109â111|publisher= AMACOM|location= New York|date=2009|isbn= 978-0-8144-1450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many top executives in business and government organizations are smart, capable people, they are also vulnerable to several decision biases that come with their powerful positions, including [[cognitive dissonance]], motivated cognitions, overconfidence, and ego-involvement.&lt;ref&gt;(Cramer et al., 2005),(Rosenzweig, 2007), (Bossidy and Charan, 2004), (USA Today, 2005), (Gilad, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenzweig, Phil|title= The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|location= NY|publisher=The Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0743291255|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impaired ability of leaders to see reality for what it is, and the more objective (less ego-involved) analysis of analysts and mid-level planners means that Step 3 of the Blindspots Analysis can be a powerful tool for pointing to potential blinders

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013 }}

A '''board of directors''' is a recognized group of people who jointly oversee the activities of an [[organization]], which can be either a for-profit [[business]], [[nonprofit organization]], or a [[government agency]]. Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.

In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s and the board is the highest [[authority]] in the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}} its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Other names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''. It may also be called "the executive board" and is often simply referred to as "the board".{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

==Roles==
{{Business administration}}
Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and setting out strategic objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]] (of which the titles vary from organization to organization; the chief executive may be titled [[chief executive officer]], [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[executive director]]);
* terminating the chief executive;
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s for the organization's performance;
* setting the salaries, compensation and benefits of senior management;

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and between  jurisdictions. For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.

Typically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the "chair" or "chairperson"), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}

==Directors==
The directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director "inside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director "executive director"]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director "outside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director "nonexecutive director"]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside director===
An inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.&lt;ref name=Ivestopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside director===
{{Main|Independent director}}

An outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.&lt;ref name="Investopedia 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that only serves a domestic market, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate "insider dealing" between insider directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.

===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===
*'''Director''' â a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.
*'''Inside director''' â a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization
*'''[[Outside director]]''' â a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization
*'''Executive director''' â an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''[[Non-executive director]]''' â an inside director who is not an executive with the organization
*'''Shadow or ''de facto'' director''' â an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization
* '''Nominee director''' â an individual who is appointed by a shareholder, creditor or interest group (whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting) and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointor/s or other interest in the appointing company

Individual directors often serve on more than one board.&lt;ref name=Businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Process and structure==
[[File:Tetley Board Room 31 August 2018 1.jpg|thumb|right|The board room of [[Tetley's Brewery]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school Board Process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142343/http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization in the USA are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Consulting and The Board Group.

===Board meetings===
[[File:Board room at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.jpg|thumb|Typical board room setting]]
A board of directors conducts its meetings according to the rules and procedures contained in its governing documents. These procedures may allow the board to conduct its business by [[conference call]] or other [[Videoconferencing|electronic]] means.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 19)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also specify how a [[quorum]] is to be determined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most organizations have adopted ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' as its guide to supplement its own rules{{where|date=November 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/faq/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |quote = ". . . the 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is the current edition of the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the rules for conducting board meetings may be less formal if there is no more than about a dozen board members present.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9-10,487-488}} An example of the informality is that [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] are not required if it's clear what is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 158|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size ===
Historically, nonprofit boards have not uncommonly had large boards with up to twenty-four members, but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/NWK6-E3CC|title=For Nonprofit Boards, Smaller is Better|last=White|first=Cyrus|date=|website=perma.cc|publisher=The South Cabin Group LLC|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that after seven people, each additional person reduces the effectiveness of [[group decision-making]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Non-corporate boards==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Membership organizations===
In [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]].{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481â483}} The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

The setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the "shareholders" are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold. These ex-officio members have all the same rights as the other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the board may be removed before their term is complete. Details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not contain such details, the section on disciplinary procedures in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In a [[public company|publicly held company]], directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the companyâthe [[shareholder]]s/stockholders.   In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].

===Governance===
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.&lt;ref name=CRI&gt;[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref name=CRI/&gt;

A contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-tier system===
In some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).

{{Globalise/UK | section|date=April 2016}}

The development of a separate board of directors to manage/govern/oversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that "the directors and the directors alone shall manage."&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;
See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election and removal ===

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Although in 2002 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASDAQ]] required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y. (2007). [http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf Corporate governance and firm value: The impact of the 2002 governance rules] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611072244/http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf |date = 11 June 2010 }}. ''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more "gray outsider directors" (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D. (1999). [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis]. ''Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so "with cause"; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A â a meeting must be held.}} The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985.}} Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous "[[golden parachute]]" which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cai|first=Jay|author2=Garner, Jacqueline |author3=Walkling, Ralph |title = Shareholder Access to the Boardroom: A Survey of Recent Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=15â26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007â2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sometimes imposes a ban (a "D&amp;O bar") on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases, and one of these was upheld in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/442382/sec-wins-d-o-bar-against-alleged-hedge-fund-scammer SEC Wins D&amp;O Bar Against Alleged Hedge Fund Scammer]. Law360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise of powers===
The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

===Duties===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder," ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Proper purpose" ====
Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}

==== "Unfettered discretion" ====
Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===="Conflict of duty and interest"====

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

=====Transactions with the company=====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..." (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}

===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than Â£5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than Â£2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B â the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:

: "(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

===== Competing with the company =====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

==== Common law duties of care and skill ====
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

: "a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

: "such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Remedies for breach of duty ====
In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

====Current trends====
Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to "soften" the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole" and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company's employees
* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see, for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Board and Society====

Most companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board &lt;ref&gt;Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board], London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society.These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification. 

Social Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed.They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.

===United States===

====SarbanesâOxley Act====

The [[SarbanesâOxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is a "financial expert."

The law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) to have a majority of independent directorsâdirectors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it.

====Size====
According to the Corporate Library's study, the average size of publicly traded company's board is 9.2 members, and most boards range from 3 to 31 members. According to Investopedia, some analysts think the ideal size is seven.&lt;ref name=BoD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp#ixzz27Kekd83e |title=Evaluating The Board Of Directors|publisher= investopedia.com|date= 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State law may specify a minimum number of directors, maximum number of directors, and qualifications for directors (e.g. whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities).&lt;ref name=BoD2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/corporate-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Corporate Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoD3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/nonprofit-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Nonprofit Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees====
While a board may have several committees, twoâthe compensation committee and audit committeeâare critical and must be made up of at least three [[independent director]]s and no inside directors. Other common committees in boards are nominating and governance.&lt;ref name=BoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf Compensation Committee Structure, Function and Best Practices] Richard E. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compensation====
Directors of [[Fortune 500]] companies received median pay of $234,000 in 2011. Directorship is a part-time job. A recent National Association of Corporate Directors study found directors averaging just 4.3 hours a week on board work.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/story/2011-10-25/director-compensation-rising/50918332/1 | work=USA Today | title=Company directors see pay skyrocket | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys indicate that about 20% of [[nonprofit foundation]]s pay their board members,&lt;ref name="Schambra"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schambra | first=William A. | title=Board Compensation: To Pay or Not to Pay? | work=Philanthropy magazine |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable | url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/compensating_foundation_directors1 | accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2% of American [[nonprofit organization]]s do.{{sfn|BoardSource|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite |author=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |date=4 February 2008 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |quote=Charities should generally not compensate persons for service on the board of directors except to reimburse direct expenses of such service. ...

===Criticism===
According to John Gillespie, a former investment banker and co-author of a book critical of boards,&lt;ref&gt;''Money for Nothing: How the Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions''&lt;/ref&gt; "Far too much of their time has been for check-the-box and cover-your-behind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders".&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; At the same time, scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousseau|first1=Peter|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|title=Director Histories and the Pattern of Acquisitions|journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=671â698|doi=10.1017/s0022109015000289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-border investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroup|first=Caleb|title=International Deal Experience and Cross-Border Acquisitions|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|pages=73â97|date=November 28, 2015|ssrn=2037512|doi=10.1111/ecin.12365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]] has been the subject of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and [[comply or explain]] systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senden|first1=Linda|title=The Multiplicity of Regulatory Responses to Remedy the Gender Imbalance on Company Boards|journal=Utrecht Law Review|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=5|pages=51â66|doi=10.18352/ulr.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, upper-middle classes tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825â855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55014">'''Business valuation''' is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the [[valuation (finance)|economic value]] of an owner's interest in a business.  [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is used by financial market participants 
to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business.  In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwok|first=Benny K. B. |title=Forensic Accountancy (2nd edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tfg8twAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-962-8972-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the court would appoint a forensic accountant as the joint expert doing the business valuation.

== Standard and premise of value ==
{{see also|Business valuation standard}}
Before the value of a business can be measured, the valuation assignment must specify the reason for and circumstances surrounding the [http://bvint.com/ business valuation]. These are formally known as the business value standard and premise of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pratt | first = Shannon | authorlink =  |author2=Robert F. Reilly |author3=Robert P. Schweihs   | title = Valuing a Business | publisher = McGraw Hill | series = McGraw-Hill Professional  | year = 2000  | doi =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WO6wd8O8dsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shannon+pratt&amp;ei=fcfUR6q-F4TCyQSrxfWABA&amp;sig=Fpqt8pGRjbLPZJ9e_QEQGFzQ7y0#PPA913,M1  | isbn = 0-07-135615-0 }} hmegrii
&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of value is the hypothetical conditions under which the business will be valued.  The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).

== Standards of value ==

* Fair market value â a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction.
* Investment value â a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value.
* Intrinsic value â the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential.

==Premises of value==

* Going Concern â Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise.
* Assemblage of assets â value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations.
* Orderly disposition â value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. 
* Liquidation â value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation.

Premise of value for fair value Calculation

* In use â If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group.
* In Exchange â If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. 
Business valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value.  In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition.  If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered.  Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability.

Note, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value.

These assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.

== Elements of business valuation ==

=== Economic conditions ===

{{Globalize/US|date=March 2011}}

A business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.
A common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's [[Beige Book]], published eight times a year by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.

=== Financial analysis ===
The [[financial statement analysis]] generally involves common size analysis, [[financial ratio|ratio analysis]] (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis.  This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's [[financial statements]] in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends.  How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.

It is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow.
Cash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.

=== Normalization of financial statements ===
The key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories:
* Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's [[financial statements]] to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its [[financial statements]].
* Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the [[fair market value]] standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.
* Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the [[financial statements]] will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance.
* Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine [[fair market value]], the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.

=== Income, asset and market approaches ===
Three different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valuadder.com/valuationguide/business-valuation-three-approaches.html Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the [[net present value]] of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the [[First chicago method]] which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.

In certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework,&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; as discussed [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|below]].

In determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.

== Income approach ==
The income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine [[fair market value]] by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into [[present value]]. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or [[cash flow]]s, discounted future cash flows ("[[discounted cash flow|DCF]]"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the [[fair market value]] of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies.  [http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/revruling59-60.htm IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.

However, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.

=== Discount or capitalization rates ===
A [[Discounted cash flow|discount rate]] or [[capitalization rate]] is used to determine the [[present value]] of the [[expected return]]s of a business. The discount rate and [[capitalization rate]] are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or [[capitalization rate]] may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.

* In [[discounted cash flow|DCF]] valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the [[cost of capital]] for the business, is used to calculate the [[net present value]] of a series of projected [[cash flow]]s. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.
* On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time.  For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate [[cash flow]]s, a [[capitalization rate]] may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months.

There are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]], which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a [[risk premium]] that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.

Capitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate.

==== Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) ====
The [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with "beta", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.

One of the criticisms of the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself.  Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.

===== Alternative valuation approaches and factor models =====
With regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the [[Arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT) as well as the [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on ''multiple'' risk sources and thus being less restrictive:

* Models of the Q theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chu|date=2009|title=On the explanatory power of firm-specific variables in cross-sections of expected returns|url=|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=|pages=306-317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FamaâFrench three-factor model]]
* [[Carhart four-factor model]]
* Fama-French five-factor model

Nevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show [[market anomalies]]. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GleiÃner Werner|first=Gregor Dorfleitner|date=2016|title=Valuing streams of risky cash flows with risk-value models|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found.

====Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model====
The Cost of Equity (Ke) is computed by using the Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model (Mod. CAPM)

&lt;math&gt;k_e  = R_f + \beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP  &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;R_f&lt;/math&gt;   =   Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government  Bond Yield)

&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;   =   Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns)

&lt;math&gt;k_e&lt;/math&gt;   =   Cost of Equity

&lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt;   =    Market Rate of Return

SCRP = Small Company Risk Premium

CSRP= Company specific Risk premium

==== Weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") ====
The [[weighted average cost of capital]] is an approach to determining a discount rate. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] method determines the subject company's actual [[cost of capital]] by calculating the weighted average of the company's [[interest (finance)|cost of debt]] and cost of [[stock|equity]]. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] must be applied to the subject company's net [[cash flow]] to total invested capital.

One of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] according to the subject company's existing [[capital structure]], the average industry [[capital structure]], or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics.

Indeed, since the [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation.

Once the [[capitalization rate]] or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax [[cash flow]], aftertax [[cash flow]], pretax [[net income]], after tax [[net income]], excess earnings, projected [[cash flow]], etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches.

Careful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net [[cash flow]] is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.

==== Build-Up Method ====
The Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a "build-up" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.

Similarly, investors who invest in small cap stocks, which are riskier than blue-chip stocks, require a greater return, called the "size premium." Size premium data is generally available from two sources: [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]'s (formerly [[Roger G. Ibbotson|Ibbotson]] &amp; Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills &amp; Inflation and [[Duff &amp; Phelps]]' Risk Premium Report.

By adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the "systematic risks." This type of investment risk cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium.

In addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include "unsystematic risk" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns.

Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. One of those categories is the "industry risk premium". It is also known as [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector.  Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code.

The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as "company specific risk." Historically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations.  P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together:

Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta*equity risk premium
TCOE = risk-free rate + beta*equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium

The only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium.

While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the following equation: TCOE = risk-free rate + Total beta*equity risk premium.

It is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach.  The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) is a relatively new concept.  It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation community since it is based on modern portfolio theory.  Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.

It is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.

[[closely held company|Closely held companies]], on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky.  (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)

== Asset-based approaches ==
The value of asset-based analysis of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to [[fair market value]] wherever possible.
The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall [[enterprise value]]. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the [[fair market value]] of the business.
In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.

Adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where [[book value|net book value]] is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may also be used as a "sanity check" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...

== Market approaches ==
{{main|Valuation using multiples}}

The market approach to business valuation is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the "comparable sales" method that is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]]. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.

The difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a [[private company]], the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a [[public company]], its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a [[market-based valuation]] would give.

When there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.

=== Guideline Public Company method ===
Guideline Public Company method entails a [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] of the subject company to [[publicly traded companies]]. The [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a "multiple." If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk.

However, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.

==Option pricing approaches==
[[Business valuation#Income.2C asset and market approaches|As above]], in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework.&lt;ref name="Damodaran"&gt;[[Aswath Damodaran]] ([[Stern School of Business]]):  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].&lt;/ref&gt; For general discussion as to context see [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|#"Valuing flexibility"]] under [[corporate finance]], and [[Contingent claim valuation]]; for detail as to applicability and other considerations see [[Real options valuation#Limitations|#"Limitations"]] under [[real options valuation]].

In general, equity may be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm,&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637â654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]&lt;/ref&gt; and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.&lt;ref name="Damodaran2"&gt;Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business):  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].&lt;/ref&gt;  The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of [[distressed securities]], already discussed in the original [[Black-Scholes]] paper.&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"/&gt; Here, since the principle of [[limited liability]] protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see [[bond valuation]]. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]]) and not to [[liquidate]]. Thus analogous to [[out the money]] options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debtâand this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|option valuation technique]]. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of [[principalâagent problem]]s;&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; see [[Principalâagent problem#Contract design|contract design]] under [[principalâagent problem]].)

Certain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [[Real options valuation#Further reading|"Applications"]] under the [[Real options valuation]] references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the [[discounted cash flow|discounted cash flow value]]) plus any real option value.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Rappaport and [[Michael Mauboussin]] ([[Columbia Business School]]): [http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/tutorial11.shtml How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's "Real Options"?]&lt;/ref&gt; Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare [[Priceâearnings ratio#PVGO|PVGO]].

A common application is to [[natural resource]] investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Brennan (finance) |last=Brennan |first=J. |authorlink2=Eduardo Schwartz |last2=Schwartz |first2=E. |jstor=2352967 |title=Evaluating Natural Resource Investments |journal=[[The Journal of Business]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=135â157 |doi=10.1086/296288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the [[underlying|underlying asset]] is the resource itself; the value of the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the [[Commodity market|price of the commodity in question]].  The value of the resource is then the difference between the value of the asset and the cost associated with [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|developing the resource]]. Where positive ("[[in the money]]") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a [[call option]].  A [[:Category:Mining companies|resource firm]] may (should) therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or [[Outline of finance#Valuation|other standard techniques]]) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the [[real options]] framework. See [[Mineral economics]].

Product [[patents]] may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents â typically firms in the [[:Category:Biotechnology companies|bio-science]], [[:Category:Technology companies|technology]],  and [[:Category:Pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical]] sectors â can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.&lt;ref&gt;P. Alonso, V. Azofra, and G. de la Fuente. (2006). [https://uam.academia.edu/PablodeAndr%C3%9EesAlonso/Papers/811295/The_real_options_component_of_firm_market_value_The_case_of_the_technological_corporation  The real options component of firm market value: The case of the technological corporation] ; A. Buckley,  K. Tse, H. Rijken and  H. Eijgenhuijsen. (2002). [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eurman/v20y2002i5p512-526.html Stock Market Valuation with Real Options: lessons from Netscape]&lt;/ref&gt;  As regards the option analysis, since the patent provides the firm with the right to develop the product, it will do so only if the [[present value]] of the expected cash flows from the product exceeds the cost of development, and the patent rights thus correspond to a [[call option]]. See [[Patent valuation#Option-based method|Patent valuation Â§ Option-based method]]. Similar analysis may be applied to [[Option (filmmaking)|options on films]] (or other works of [[intellectual property]]) and the valuation of [[film studio]]s.

== Cultural valuation method ==
Besides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.

== Discounts and premiums ==
The valuation approaches yield the [[fair market value]] of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.
Discussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the "levels of value". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.
The intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies â small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.
Controlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a [[control premium]] over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.
Non-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less "liquid" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.
Despite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening .  Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.
Valuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.

=== Discount for lack of control ===
The first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists:
MID = 1 â [1 / (1 + CP)]
The most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]]. Mergerstat defines the "control premium" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&amp;A transaction.
While it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.

=== Discount for lack of marketability ===
A "discount for lack of marketability" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block.&lt;ref name=IRSpub&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/dlom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WillDLOM&gt;http://www.willamette.com/pubs/presentations/tax_lawyer_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

All other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.&lt;ref&gt;Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: "Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Several empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. &lt;ref&gt;Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively.  Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as  much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family-owned companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==== Restricted stock studies ====
Restricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.
The underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.

==== Option pricing ====
In addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC [[Regulation S]], enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the [[marketability discounts]] inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.
Studies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds [[restricted stock]] and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a [[put option|put]]), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the [[put option|put]] is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%.  However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection.  A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or [[Single-stock futures]], demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.

==== Pre-IPO studies ====
Another approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

=== Applying the studies ===
The studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the [[rate of return]] to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.
The referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).

== Estimates of business value ==
The evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are "publicly traded," meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated "market capitalization" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded "over the counter" or in "pink sheets"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.

A number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, &amp; Moore, "Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., "Value of Private Businesses in the United States," Business Economics (2009) 44, 87â108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.

A '''change request''' is a [[document]] containing a call for an adjustment of a [[system]]; it is of great importance in the [[change management process]].

[[Image:Example change request.png|right|350px|'''Figure 1''': Example change request for the car industry|alt=]]

A change request is declarative, i.e. it states what needs to be accomplished, but leaves out how the change should be carried out. Important elements of a change request are an ID, the customer (ID), the [[Deadline (time limit)|deadline]] (if applicable), an indication whether the change is required or optional, the change type (often chosen from a domain-specific [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and a change [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], which is a piece of narrative (Keller, 2005). An example of a change request can be found in Figure 1 on the right.

Change requests typically originate from one of five sources: 
# problem reports that identify [[Software bug|bugs]] that must be fixed, which forms the most common source
# system enhancement requests from [[User (computing)|users]]
# events in the development of other systems
# changes in underlying structure and or standards (e.g. in software development this could be a new operating system)
# demands from senior management (Dennis, Wixom &amp; Tegarden, 2002).
Additionally, in [[Project Management]], change requests may also originate from an unclear understanding of the goals and the objectives of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Dave. [http://www.pmhut.com/how-to-control-change-requests "How to Control Change Requests"], ''PM Hut'', November 15, 2009. Retrieved on March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Change requests have many different names, which essentially describe the same concept:
* Request For Change (RFC) by Rajlich (1999); RFC is also a common term in [[ITIL]] (Keller, 2005) and [[PRINCE2]] (Onna &amp; Koning, 2003).
* Engineering Change (EC) by Huang and Mak (1999);
* Engineering Change Request (ECR) at Aero (Helms, 2002);
* Engineering Change Order (ECO) by Loch and Terwiesch (1999) and Pikosz and Malmqvist (1998). Engineering Change Order is a separate step after ECR. After ECR is approved by Engineering Department then an ECO is made for making the change;
* Change Notice at Chemical (Helms, 2002);
* Action Request (AR) at ABB Robotics AB (Kajko-Mattson, 1999);
* Change Request (CR) is, among others, used by Lam (1998), MÃ¤kÃ¤rÃ¤inen (2000), Dennis, et al. (2002), Crnkovic, Asklund and Persson-Dahlqvist (2003) and at ABB Automation Products AB (Kajko-Mattsson, 1999).
* Operational Change Request (OCR).
* Enterprise Change Request (ECR).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">A '''chief innovation officer''' ('''CINO''') or '''chief technology innovation officer''' ('''CTIO''') is a person in a [[company]] who is primarily responsible for managing the process of [[innovation]] and [[change management]] in an organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/16/chief-innovation-officer-leadership-managing-accenture.html |title=You Need A Chief Innovation Officer |publisher=Forbes |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being in some cases the person who "originates new ideas but also recognizes innovative ideas generated by other people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/conferences/innovation06/heidrick.pdf ''Heidrick &amp;  Struggles'' (Time Inc. website)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602114906/http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/conferences/innovation06/heidrick.pdf |date=June 2, 2010 }} "What Makes a Successful Chief Innovation Officer?&lt;/ref&gt;  The CINO also manages [[Technological change]].

==Overview==
The term "chief innovation officer" was first coined and described in the 1998 book ''[[Fourth Generation R&amp;D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. and Morris, L. Fourth Generation R&amp;D - Managing Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation, Wiley, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations with a CINO/CTIO are practicing part of the fourth generation of innovation theory and practice to emerge since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. Chapter 21 "The Generations of R&amp;D and Innovation Management", Encyclopedia of Technology &amp; Innovation Management, edited by V.K. Narayanan &amp; Gina Colarelli O'Connor, Wiley 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Successful chief innovation officers focus on delivering on the key principles behind innovation - [[leadership]], creating networks, harnessing [[Voice of the customer|VOC]]/HOC in idea development, leveraging the right incentives, and building/running an effective, transparent, and efficient innovation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/05/24/5-key-success-principles-the-cure-for-innovation-envy/ |title=5 Key Success Principles â the Cure for Innovation Envy &amp;#124; Innovation Management |publisher=Innovationmanagement.se |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CINO is responsible for managing the innovation process inside the organization that identifies [[strategies]], [[business opportunities]] and new [[technologies]] and then develops new capabilities and [[architectures]] with partners, new [[business models]] and new industry structures to serve those opportunities.

CINO/CTIO doesn't have to report to the CEO or another C-level executive. CINO/CTIO is a functional title, similar to the [[chief information security officer]]. The words "chief" and "officer" are used to communicate that a person in this position is responsible for driving innovation throughout the entire organization. Using a functional "chief ... officer" title helps to communicate that this is a cross-organizational position and enables this person to work across organizational silos.

The CINO/CTIO focuses on radical or breakthrough innovation. The coined term CINO/CTIO is used to differentiate the position from the [[chief information officer]], who is responsible for the information technology and computer systems that support enterprise goals.

==Chief technology innovation officer==
A chief technology innovation officer (CTIO) is focused on the organizational innovation through technology. This is an important strategic position especially in an organization that has significant technology component in addition to the traditional information technology. This position is typically held by a person with a broad technical expertise in that organization's industry.

The title chief technology innovation officer is commonly used in the organizations that have a technology component as a part of its core business. The CTIO is responsible for maintaining organizational technological strategy, defining the requirements for new technology implementations and communicating them to key business stakeholders.

The CTIO is responsible for organizational leadership on technology issues, management of the technology research and review function, ensuring the alignment of technology vision with business strategy, and for driving technology innovation throughout the entire organization. The position can also be responsible for tracking new technology developments in areas of interest to the organization to ensure that it maintains a technological edge within the industry, analyzing and improving upon technology standards and maintaining organizational awareness of new technologies.

In business dealings, [[Financial transaction|transactions]] often occur that include variables based on future events that can be difficult to ascertain (for example, a company may sell in an amount stock along with a percentage of that companyâs net profits.)  As these transactions are contingent on payments that occur in the future, and the total selling price cannot be determined as of the end of the taxable year of the sale, they are known as '''Contingent Payment Sales'''.&lt;ref&gt;See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the uncertainty surrounding the final amounts of these transactions, they are difficult to evaluate for the purpose of tax liability.

== Methods of computing tax liability for contingent sales ==

===Maximum Selling Price===
If the maximum  amount of sales can be determined in the year in which they occur by assuming that all contingencies are met, the price can be calculated in a manner similar to the installment sales method.  If the amount is reduced in subsequent years, than the formula is recomputed accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg Â§15.A453-1(c)(2)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed Period===
If the maximum selling price cannot be determined, but the period over which payments may be received is fixed, then the sellerâs basis is recovered ratably over the period during which payment may be received under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. Â§15.A453-1(c)(3)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the agreement neither specifies a stated maximum price nor limits payments to a fixed period, than a question arises as to whether a sale has realistically occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Treas. Reg. Â§15.A453-1(c)(4)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example in Finance ==

===General Mills Acquisition Case===

====Origin of the Transaction====
Seeking to build growth [[momentum]], [[General Mills]] studied areas of potential growth and value creation in the spring of 1998. This had generated some smaller acquisitions and a general receptivity to acquisition proposals by the firm. In early 2000, the firmâs financial advisers suggested that Diageo might be interested in selling Pillsbury, in an effort to focus Diageo on its beverage business, and that Pillsbury would complement General Millsâ existing businesses.

In March 2000, Diageoâs chief operating officer contacted General Millsâ chairman and CEO to explore a possible sale of Pillsbury. General Mills submitted its proposed deal terms to Diageo in June 2000âthe total proposed payment was $10.0 billion. Diageo submitted an [[asking price]] of $10.5 billion. The two sides would budge no further, and it looked as if the negotiations would
founder. General Mills did not want to issue more than one-third of its post-transaction shares to Diageo, and believed that its shares were undervalued in the stock market. Diageo believed it was necessary to value General Millsâ shares at the current trading prices. In an effort to bridge the difference in positions, the two firms agreed upon including in the terms of the deal a '''contingent payment''' on the first anniversary of the transaction that would depend on General Millsâ share price. James Lawrence, chief financial officer of General Mills, said, âWe genuinely believe this is a way in which they could have their [[cake]] and we could eat it, too. Thereâs no question in my mind that, absent this [[Instrumentation (music)|instrument]], we wouldnât have been able to reach this deal.â

David Van Benschoten, General Millsâ treasurer, added that the contingent payment was another example of the âdevelopment of the use of [options] in the past 20 years as finance has come to first understand, and work with, the constructs of optionality.â

'''''Corporate DNA''''' is [[business jargon]] for [[organizational culture]]. It is a metaphor based on the biological term ''[[DNA]]'', the molecule that encodes the genetic instructions in living organisms.{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}}{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=5}}

In a 1997 book, Gareth Morgan defined the corporate DNA metaphor as the "visions, values, and sense of purpose that bind an organization together" to enable individuals to "understand and absorb the mission and challenge of the whole enterprise".{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=95}} Lindgreen and Swaen define it as an "organization's culture and strategy".{{sfn|Lindgreen|Swaen|2010}} Ken Baskin defines it as "flexible, universally available database of company procedures and structures" which develops from the company's history, and that the organization's employees behave to satisfy the resultant corporate identity.{{sfn|Mason|2006|ps=This corporate DNA is built from past history and Baskin believes that people act in ways to fulfil a company's identity due to the corporate DNA}} Baskin also likens the availability of information throughout an organization to the presence of DNA in all of an organism's [[Cell (biology)|cells]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1999}} [[Arnold Kransdorff]] defines corporate DNA as the set of institution-specific experiences that "characterizes any organization's ability to perform".{{sfn|Kransdorff|2006|p=Back cover}}&lt;!-- similar claims are in the text, but I don't have access to it --&gt;

==Definition==
In a ''[[Strategy+Business]]'' article, Gary Neilson, Bruce A. Pasternack, and Decio Mendes state that the four DNA bases for an organization are its structure, decision rights, motivating factors, and information.{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}} In the book ''DNA Profiling : The Innovative Company: How to Increase Creative Ability in Business'', Isabelle Denervaud and Olivier Chatin state that the four organizational bases are actors, ideation, emotion, and collaboration.{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=17-18}} Denervaud and Chatin also extend the metaphor by identifying factors that may mutate organizational DNA (discontinuity, traditional playing fields, new lands, and individuals),{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=5, 19}} much like a genetic [[mutation]] may change the [[nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] of the [[genome]] of an organism, and Neilson, Pasternack, and Mendes describe a company adapting to structural and environmental changes analogous to biological [[adaptation]].{{sfn|Neilson|Pasternack|Mendes|2003}} The term DNA is also used to describe an organization's ability to [[innovation|innovate]].{{sfn|Galt|2010}}{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011|p=15}}

In ''Corporate Culture: The Ultimate Strategic Asset'', Eric Flamholtz and Yvonne Randle state that organization culture is "transmitted to generations of employees" via that organization's DNA,{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=18}} and that the DNA of the culture of the company is established "during its initial stages" reflecting the "personal and professional values" of the founders.{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=18}} They also state that it can be "transformed through the entrance of new people with new ideas",{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=194}} and that significant differences in organizational performance can be derived from small changes in organizational DNA.{{sfn|Flamholtz|Randle|2011|p=24}} According to Virginia Healy-Tangney, such changes must come throughout the organization and are time-consuming.{{sfn|Healy-Tangney|2013}} These changes may result in increased [[productivity]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], and in a reduction of [[Turnover (employment)|employee turnover]].{{sfn|Asplund|Blacksmith|2012}}

Preservation of organizational DNA is important to ensure business continuity and persistence. Organizations have implemented various techniques to prevent organizational DNA from being controlled by external influences, such as [[Mars, Incorporated]] remaining [[Privately held company|privately owned]] to limit control of [[share capital]].{{sfn|Nurdin|2011|p=180}} Another method is by branding corporate work environments to "clearly reflect the culture" of the organization.{{sfn|Haynes|2012}}

&lt;!-- this needs better phrasing --&gt;
DNA is used to describe the skills, properties, or qualities of an individual that describe that individual's character.{{sfn|Dyer|Gregersen|Christensen|2011}}
{{sfn|Denervaud|Chatin|2011}}

The term is also used to describe the set of architectural and spatial characteristics considered by the [[Residency (domicile)|inhabitants]] of a city to be constituents of that city's [[Cultural identity|identity]].{{sfn|Crowhurst Lennard|Lennard|1995|p=7}} This may include "materials and colours, a typical arrangement of scale and architectural forms, building lot size, roof lines, scale of public and semi-public spaces" which should be respected by new buildings and urban spaces in the city.{{sfn|Crowhurst Lennard|Lennard|1995|p=7}} In an article in ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', Kelli Richards claims that the organizational culture at [[Apple Inc.]] in the 1990s has become part of the DNA of [[Silicon Valley]].{{sfn|Richards|2012}}

'''Corporate sourcing''' refers to a system where divisions of companies coordinate the [[procurement]] and distribution of materials, parts, equipment, and supplies for the organization.  This is a [[supply chain]], [[purchasing]]/[[procurement]], and [[inventory]] function. This enables [[bulk discounting]], [[auditing]], and [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|Sarbanes-Oxley compliance]].

Duties of a corporate sourcing agent include:
#Coordinating all activities related to [[procurement]] of a [[commodity]] beginning with intent to purchase through delivery
#Analyzing the requirements of the commodity, including preliminary specifications, preferred supplier, and date commodity is needed
#Soliciting and evaluating proposals for the requested commodity. Investigating and/or interviewing potential suppliers to determine if they meet the specified requirements.

Some of corporate sourcing agents:
[[Richman Chemical]], [[Onetouch]], [[Worldwide Brands]], [[SAOS]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6147">'''Desktop outsourcing''' is the process in which an [[organization]] contracts a third party to maintain and manage parts of its [[IT infrastructure]]. Contracts vary in depth and can range from [[Computer maintenance|Computer hard]]- and [[software maintenance]] to [[Desktop virtualisation]], [[SaaS]]-implementations and [[Helpdesk]] operation.  It is estimated, that 32% of U.S. and Canadian IT organisations make use of desktop outsourcing in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekker|first1=Scott|title=Should You Outsource Your Help Desk?|url=http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2014/09/01/Should-You-Outsource.aspx?Page=3|website=Redmond Magazine|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market reports suggest the adoption of [[BYOD]] policies to allow the end-user a free choice of devices in their working environment may increase this market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xbv6lv/global_desktop|website=Research and Markets|publisher=TechNavio|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desktop-Outsourcing im Trend|url=http://www.itadministrator.de/themen/virtualisierung/111035.html|website=ITAdministrator.de|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viability==
Justification for desktop outsourcing could include shifting focus and energy to areas of core competency, reducing staffing costs, and the routine maintenance, upgrades, and repairs associated with managing multitudes of PC systems and servers. (Applegate et al. 2007). Managers may also seek desktop outsourcing as a method of simplifying organisational structures to cut costs associated with them.&lt;ref name="dfcw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedlander|first1=David|title=Why outsource desktop management?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Why-outsource-desktop-management|website=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For smaller companies it might also be more viable financially to outsource their desktop at a set price per machine, rather than creating an entire internal IT department.&lt;ref name="littman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littman|first1=Dan|title=Outsourcing the desktop|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2655241/techology-business/outsourcing-the-desktop.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market growth can also be attributed to the decreasing price of hardware, making replacement more favourable than repairs.&lt;ref name="dfcw" /&gt; Possible risks when desktop outsourcing are ensuring continued support for old a unique systems the company depends on, specifically if any of the systems in question were internally developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Stephen|title=Managing Risk in Outsourcing: The Strategy|url=http://www.sourcingmag.com/managing-risk-in-outsourcing-the-strategy/|website=SourcingMag.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may cause the contractor to be unable to fulfil their contractual obligations, as in the case of the US Navy outsourcing their IT systems to EDS in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ephraim|title=Painful lessons from IT outsourcing gone bad|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2652801/outsourcing/painful-lessons-from-it-outsourcing-gone-bad.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market situation==
A 2012 TechNavio market report forecasts that the desktop outsourcing market will grow by 4.65% yearly, between 2012 and 2016. [[Atos]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[IBM]] are considered the leading desktop outsourcing vendors for that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research and Markets: Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016 Research Report|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-markets-global-desktop-outsourcing-104100265.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gartner]] report from 2013, however, considers the desktop outsourcing market to be in decline, with growth only occurring on the Latin American and Asia/Pacific markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide IT Outsourcing Market to Reach $288 Billion in 2013|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2550615|website=gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic analysis typically focuses on two views of organization: the industry-view and the [[resource-based view]] (RBV). These views analyse the organisation without taking into consideration relationship between the organizations strategic choice (i.e. [[Porter generic strategies]]) and institutional frameworks.'' The National Diamond''' is a tool for analyzing the organization's task environment. The National Diamond highlights that strategic choices should not only be a function of industry structure and a firm's resources, it should also be a function of the constraints of the institutional framework. Institutional analysis (such as the National Diamond) becomes increasingly important as firms enter new operating environments and operate within new institutional frameworks.

'''[[Michael Porter]]'s National Diamond''' framework resulted from a study of patterns of [[comparative advantage]] among industrialized nations. It works to integrate much of Porter's previous work in his competitive [[five forces]] theory, his [[value chain]] framework as well as his theory of [[competitive advantage]] into a consolidated framework that looks at the sources of competitive advantage sourcable from the national context. It can be used both to analyze a firm's ability to function in a national market, as well as analyse a national market's ability to compete in an international market.

It recognizes four pillars of research (factor conditions, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, firm structure, strategy and rivalry) that one must undertake in analysing the viability of a nation competing in a particular international market, but it also can be used as a comparative analysis tool in recognising which country a particular firm is suited to expanding into.

Two of the aforementioned pillars focus on the (national) [[macroeconomics]] environment to determine if the demand is present along with the factors needed for production (i.e. both extreme ends of the [[value chain]]). Another pillar focuses on the specific relationships supporting industries have with the particular firm/nation/industry being studied. The last pillar it looks at the firm's strategic response ([[microeconomics]]) i.e. its strategy, taking into account the industry structure and rivalry (see [[five forces]]). In this way it tries to highlight areas of competitive advantage as well as competitive weakness, by looking at a companies/nations suitability to the particular conditions of a particular market.

==Components==

The six different components of the framework are:
* Factor endowment
* Related and supporting industries
* Demand conditions
* Strategy, structure, and rivalry
* Government
* Chance
===Factor conditions (endowments)===
Factor endowment can be categorized into two forms:
* "Home-grown" resources/highly specialized resources
* Natural endowments

For example, in analyzing Hollywood's preeminence in film production, Porter has pointed out the local concentration of skilled labor, including the different schools of film ([[UCLA]] &amp; [[University of Southern California|USC]]) in the area. Also, resource constraints may encourage development of substitute capabilities; Japan's relative lack of raw materials has spurred miniaturization and [[Zero Defects|zero-defect]] manufacturing.

===Related and supporting industries===
For many firms, the presence of related and supporting industries is of critical importance to the growth of that particular industry. A critical concept here is that national competitive strengths tend to be associated with "clusters" of industries. For example, [[Silicon Valley]] in the USA and [[Silicon Glen]] in the UK are [[techno cluster]]s of high-technology industries which includes individual computer software and semi-conductor firms. In Germany, a similar cluster exists around chemicals, synthetic dyes, textiles and textile machinery.

===Demand conditions===
Demand conditions in the [[domestic market]] provide the primary driver of growth, innovation and quality improvement. The premise is that a strong domestic market stimulates the firm from being a startup to a slightly expanded and bigger organization. As an illustration, we can take the case of Germany which has some of the world's premier automobile companies like [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[BMW]], [[Porsche]]. German auto companies have dominated the world when it comes to the high-performance segment of the world automobile industry. However, their position in the market of cheaper, mass-produced autos is much weaker. This can be linked to a domestic market which has traditionally demanded a high level of engineering performance. Also, the transport infrastructure of Germany, with its [[Autobahns]] does tend to favor high-performance automobiles.

===Strategy, structure and rivalry===
National performance in particular sectors is inevitably related to the strategies and the structure of the firms in that sector. Competition plays a big role in driving innovation and the subsequent upgradation of [[competitive advantage]]. Since domestic competition is more direct and impacts earlier than steps taken by foreign competitors, the stimulus provided by them is higher in terms of innovation and efficiency. As an example, the [[Japanese automobile industry]] with 8 major competitors ([[Honda]], [[Toyota]], [[Suzuki]], [[Isuzu]], [[Nissan]], [[Mazda]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Subaru]]) provide intense competition in the domestic market, as well as the foreign markets in which they compete.

===The role of government===
The role of government in Porter's Diamond Model is "acting as a catalyst and challenger; it is to encourage - or even push - companies to raise their aspirations and move to higher levels of competitive performance â¦" . They must encourage companies to raise their performance, stimulate early demand for advanced products, focus on specialized factor creation and to stimulate local rivalry by limiting direct cooperation and enforcing anti-trust regulations.

===Chance===
The role of chance basically denotes the idea that it may occur that many times a product or an enterprise may get an opportunity to maximize its benefits out of sheer luck. Thus chance if received plays a key role in determining the fate of the product as well.

==Criticism==
Criticism on Porter's national diamond model revolve around a number of assumptions that underlie it. As described by Davies and Ellis: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; "sustained prosperity may be achieved without a nation becoming 'innovation-driven', strong 'diamonds' are not in place in the home bases of many internationally successful industries and inward foreign direct investment does not indicate a lack of 'competitiveness' or low national productivity". &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Porter generalized from the North American, European and Japanese experiences; for countries developing in the presence of these now developed regions of the world, the model may need to be re-examined.

'''Ecoprenuership''', also known as '''Green Entrepreneurship''', not to be mistaken for â[[Sustainable Business]]â or â[[Green Business]]â is most simply referred to as the development of enterprise through entrepreneurship while incorporating an environmentally responsible perspective into the operations and goals of the entrepreneur. Ecopreneurship is also a term coined to represent the process of principles of entrepreneurship being applied to create businesses that solve environmental problems or operate sustainably.

==History and Development of Ecoprenuership==
Literature began being published on Ecoprenuership in the early 1990s with the introduction of ''Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecoprenuership'' by Gwynn Schuyler (Schuyler. 1998). Schuyler offers a simple yet unprecedented definition of Ecoprenuership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merging Economic and Environmental Concerns Through Ecopreneurship|last=Schuyler|first=Gwen|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Schuyler's definition in 1998 the definition of Ecopreuership has developed and concepts defining the term have changed. David Kainrath of the Umea School of Business has defined Ecoprenuership as the convergence of three main concepts, including:
# Eco-innovation
# Eco-opportunity
# Eco- commitment
Furthermore, Kainrath states that an Ecoprenuerial Company is "a company in which the three Ecoprenuership Concepts manifest."

== Systems thinking ==
Systems Thinking is a core principle to any business concerned with sustainability and the environment. It is an approach to problem solving that studies how something interacts with its environment as a whole, whether that be social, economic or natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thinking.net/Systems_Thinking/Intro_to_ST/intro_to_st.html|title=Intro to Systems Thinking|last=Aronson|first=Dan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to a linear thinking model, which would isolate a problem and study only its directly related processes to find solutions. It consists of the notion that in order to understand vertical problems (looking deeply at one particular issue), you must understand and evaluate the horizontal environment as a whole (the entire system and its interrelated functions). As it pertains to business is best illustrated in the book ''Entrepreneurship and Sustainability'' by Andrea Larsen,&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Systems thinking applied to new ventures reminds us that companies operate in complex sets of interlocking living and non-living, including markets and supply chains as well as non-living systems.... Taking a systems perspective reminds us that we are accustomed to thinking of business in terms of discrete units with clear boundaries between them. We forget that these boundaries exist primarily in our minds or as legal constructs."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Strategy and the Environment|last=Larson|first=Andrea|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=304â317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Product Design==
[[Product design]] incorporating sustainability can happen at any stage of the business, including material extraction, [[logistics]], the manufacturing process, disposal, etc. Sustainable product design can be achieved using innovative technology (or Eco-innovation), cradle to cradle design, [[Biomimetics|bio-mimicry]], etc. In a description by the government of Canada's department on Innovation, Science and Economic Development, sustainable product design is further explained:

"Product design offers the opportunity to incorporate green and socially responsible attributes into a product. Referred to as Design for Sustainability (D4S), it is a process that addresses environmental and social considerations in the earliest stages of the product development process to minimize negative environmental and social impacts throughout the product's life cycle and to comply with the principles of economic, social and ecological sustainability.

Sustainable product design can encompass the selection of materials, use of resources, production requirements and planning for the final disposition (recycling, reuse, remanufacturing, or disposal) of a product. It takes into account the socio-economic circumstances of the company and the opportunity for the firm to address social problems associated with poverty, safety, inequity, health and the working environment. It is not a stand-alone methodology but one that must be integrated with a company's existing product design so that environmental and social parameters can be integrated with traditional product attributes such as quality, cost, and functionality."

==Innovative Technology==
Companies practicing ecopreneurship aim to solve environmental issues by developing new technology or innovating existing technologies. Within the past five years modern society has witnessed development of precedent setting technologies such as long range electric vehicles as well as the improvement though innovation of existing technologies such as solar panels. Examples of innovation backed by an environmentally responsible attitude has inspired a new class of entrepreneurs who identify as Ecoprenuers.

The development of innovative technologies has developed an opportunity for Ecoprenuers to apply technology to sustainable or green businesses. Cosmin Nacu and Silvia Avasilcai state that "this trend has created a full range of opportunities for entrepreneurs: from creating green-technology, using technology to promote environmental sustainability (e.g. energy management) to simply make the existing business more environmentally friendly to take advantage of the benefits" (Source). The development of new and innovative technologies are complimentary to the development of green enterprises and enable Ecoprenuers to continue developing enterprise that are environmentally sustainable.

==Cradle to cradle Design==
[[Cradle-to-cradle design]] is a popular environmental approach to product design that seeks to eliminate waste by designing products that can be continuously recirculated through our economy. This is contrasted against a "cradle to grave" design which typically includes single use products or products made of multiple different materials that cannot be separated in order to be recycled properly.[5] Cradle to Cradle design is mimicked after processes in the natural environment which do not create waste but instead every output is an input for another organism. Cradle to Cradle design is often achieved through using environmentally friendly resources (non-toxic) that can either be recycled into other products or composted. Another important component of cradle to cradle design is the ability to easily take products apart for better reuse as well as designing with durability in mind. This idea was popularized by the 2002 book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' written by William McDonough and Michael Braungart.

==Challenges and Opportunities==
The Sustainable Business Industry is one of the biggest opportunities in commerce in the past 20 years according to Thierry Volery, author of Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volery|first1=Thiery|title=Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/T_Volery/publication/36387113_Ecopreneurship_rationale_current_issues_and_futures_challenges/links/54b3e67a0cf2318f0f9697fb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, there continues to be a trend of challenges that Ecoprenuers face when developing their enterprise. "Ecology and economy have often been seen as conflicting, because the prevailing view is that there is an inherent and fixed trade-off between the two" and Ecoprenuers are constantly subjected to higher prices of operation that are inherit to operating in an environmentally sustainable way Rationale, current issues and futures challenges|url. The fact that Ecoprenuers aim to sustain "public goods" such as air, oceans, topsoil and wild species develops a challenge of measuring the use and value of these goods. Volery, author of '''Ecopreneurship: Rationale, current issues and futures challenges''' states  "it will never be profitable to  produce public goods privately, because the producer who incurs the cost of production cannot prevent the consumer from using the good freely" because public goods are non-excludable in consumption meaning that citizens cannot stop consuming certain public goods such as water or air.

Opportunities to develop sustainable business through Ecoprenuership represent a huge opportunity to take advantage of business practices of the future. Companies leading the way in sustainable business practices are taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015.[44] Since environmental concerns have become pressing many profitable opportunities have arisen. Government backed grants often lay the foundation for Ecoprenuers to take advantage of a quickly growing industry while being able to kickstart their endeavors with government money.

== Triple bottom line accounting ==
[[Triple bottom line]] Accounting is an accounting method that combines traditional [[accounting]] methods of measuring profit with those that measure social and environmental benefits as well. The phrase was created by John Elkington in 1994 at his company [http://www.sustainability.com/company SustainAbility]. Some criticisms have sprung up over what methods are to be used to measure environmental and social impacts.

== Legal forms ==
Ecopreneurs may decide to develop their company under traditional business legal forms like a [[sole proprietorship]] or an [[Limited liability company|LLC]] or they might chose some newer forms discussed below. These business forms are popular among the environmentally conscious community for their emphasis on social benefit.
* [[Low-profit limited liability company]] or (L3C) is a company that follows the same legal and tax codes as a traditional LLC but has a main goal of increasing social welfare like that of a non-profit organization.  This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013.
* [[Benefit corporation]] is for-profit legal entity that differs in its purpose and accountability from that of a regular corporation. Its emphasis on mission-driven purpose allows it a different accountability to stakeholders. This form of business is not available in every state of the USA as of 2013. More information can be found on the official website benefitcorp.net [http://benefitcorp.net/]

'''Electronic News Production System '''(ENPS) is a [[software]] application developed by the [[Associated Press]]'s Broadcast Technology division for producing, editing, timing, organizing and running news broadcasts. The system is scalable and flexible enough to handle anything from the local news at a small-market station to large organizations spanning remote [[News bureau|bureau]]s in multiple countries.

The basic organization of each news broadcast is called a "rundown" (US) or "running order" (UK). The run-down is a grid listing scripts, [[video]], [[Sound|audio]], [[character generator]] data, [[teleprompter]] control, director notations, camera operator cues, and timing estimates for each section of the broadcast.

ENPS integrates scripts, [[wire feed]]s, [[device control]], and production information in a [[Server (computing)|server]]/client environment. On the server side, ENPS runs an identical [[backup server]] (called a "buddy") at all times as a fail-safe. If the primary server fails, all users are redirected to the buddy server until such time as the primary comes back on-line. All document changes are queued on the buddy and copied back to the primary automatically when it returns to production. Note that this is not a [[mirror website|mirror server]] as the changed data is copied to the buddy, but there is no direct replication inherent within the intercommunications between the servers, so if the data is corrupted due to hardware failure on one server, this corruption will not be replicated to the "buddy".

Device control can be managed either through a [[serial interface]], or the MOS ([[Media Object Server]]) protocol. MOS functionality is included in the base ENPS license, but may be an extra add-on for the device that needs to interface with ENPS. MOS items such as video or audio clips can be added directly to scripts, and then used by third party software and devices during the broadcast. Many broadcast media systems support the MOS protocol to a greater or lesser degree by implementing any of the seven MOS Protocol 'profiles'. An example of a MOS System which fully supports all seven MOS Profiles is SIENNA [http://www.enps.com/partner_systems/51/gallery_sienna] [http://sienna.tv], used by ENPS customers including the BBC.

The ENPS client utilizes the .NET framework and other Windows-only technologies. The client, therefore, will only run in the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]].

ENPS was originally developed by the Associated Press for use at the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]] as a replacement for the [[text mode]] system [[BASYS]] (which developed into [[Avid iNEWS]]), and the Corporation has the largest installation of the system with over 12,000 users in 300 different locations [http://www.enps.com/files/marketing/ENPS%20and%20BBC.pdf].

On December 15, 2011 [[Synaptic Digital]] announced a partnership with ENPS to deliver their content on [[thenewsmarket.com]] directly to subscribers of their feed.[http://www.synapticdigital.com/2011/12/15/synaptic-digital-teams-up-with-the-associated-press-to-distribute-video-content-from-thenewsmarket-com-via-enps-system/]

The '''Employee of the Month''' (EOM) is a type of reward program given out by companies (often to encourage the staff to work harder and more productively). It involves recognising employees for achieving excellence in their field, and being the best worker across all fields. Traditionally, the award is given out every month, but that is not necessarily the case. The system is popular in the United States.

==Criteria==
One of the main factors of Employee of the Month systems that make them unique is the criteria used to work out who is the "best" worker for a given month. A document called Employee of the Month Selection Criteria suggests the two main criteria are "quality of work standards" and "attitude standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/1791437/Employee-of-the-Month-Selection-Criteria | title=Employee of the Month Selection Criteria | accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee of the month is usually based on performance, quality, attendance and many other determining factors from previous month(s) based on the associate's role.  The "best" worker is then rewarded the following month with the title of "Employee of the Month". During this month, the associate is usually rewarded with a certificate, trophy, or other honors.

In '''FSN analysis''', items are classified according to their rate of consumption. The items are classified broadly into three groups: F â means Fast moving, S â means Slow moving, N â means Non-moving. The FSN analysis is conducted generally on the following basis:
*The last date of [[receipt]] of the items or the last date of the issue of items, whichever is later, is taken into account.
*The time period is usually calculated in terms of months or number of days and it pertains to the time elapsed seems the last movement was recorded.
 
FSN analysis helps a company in identification of the following
*The items considered to be âactiveâ may be reviewed regularly on more frequent basis.
*Items whose [[stocks]] at hand are higher as compared to their rates of consumption.
*Non-moving items whose consumption is ânilâ or almost insignificant.

The '''grandfather principle''' is related to the [[Management accounting|control]] and order within [[hierarchical]] [[organisations]].

==Decisions making==

Examples of the principle's use in decision making:

* A major decision has to be approved by the [[Management|manager]]'s manager (the "grandparent").
* To guarantee fair and objective remuneration, all decisions concerning personal [[compensation and benefits]] made by a manager are also approved by the manager's manager.

==Responsibility/authorisation==

Examples of the principle's use related to responsibility and authorisation:

* A case of uncertainty about personal responsibility or authorisation should be cleared by the immediate manager in conjunction with the manager's manager.

==Flaws/corruption==

Examples of the principle's use to limit organisational corruption:

* An individual who identifies corruptive order within the organization hierarchical structure related to his/hers own manager is advised to contact the manager's manager concerning the matter. 
* An individual who identifies corruptive order within the organization hierarchical structure can bring up the matter before a manager at ANY hierarchical level within the organization. The "ANY" is related to where the corruptive part is located hierarchically and the immediate manager above that level, is the preferred manager to be addressed. The manager, acting Grandfather of the organization as entity, should treat the individual, acting Father and guard of the organization as entity, with a mutual respect related to the authority of the hierarchical level addressed, the importance of the subject being addressed and the courage undertaken to surface the subject in matter.

'''Latigent LLC''' was an international provider of [[Business Intelligence]], Enterprise RSS, and [[Call Center]] Reporting and Analytics software.

==History==
Latigent, LLC of [[Chicago, IL]], was founded in 2002, as a privately held and funded company, by Chris Crosby and Jason Kolb, two veterans of the contact center industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Both founders believed that there was a more efficient way of using the information typically gathered in the contact center to better serve the customer and more profitably serve the enterprise.  As a result, the Latigent BlueVue performance management product was born and introduced to the market in 2003.

In December 2005, Latigent released BlueVue II, a Business Information (BI) suite.  Besides reporting functionality and complete data warehousing capabilities, BlueVue II also offered data integration capabilities for performance management.

On September 27, 2007 [[Cisco Systems]] announced a definitive agreement to acquire Latigent LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_092707.html Announced A Definitive Agreement to Acquire Latigent LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Looker Data Sciences''' (doing business as '''Looker''') is an American [[computer software]] company headquartered in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  Looker markets a [[data exploration]] and discovery [[business intelligence]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looker.com/ |title=Looker |publisher=Looker |date= |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in Santa Cruz, California in January, 2012 by Lloyd Tabb and Ben Porterfield. The product grew out of Tabb's experience building software at companies like [[Netscape]], [[LiveOps]], and Luminate before founding Looker.

Looker makes use of a simple modeling language called LookML that lets data teams define the relationships in their database so business users can explore, save, and download data without needing to know the [[SQL]] query language.
The product was the first commercially available [[business intelligence]] platform built for and aimed at scalable or [[Massively parallel (computing)|massively parallel]] [[relational database management systems]] like [[Amazon Redshift]], Google [[BigQuery]], HP [[Vertica]], [[Netezza]], and [[Teradata]].

On August 13, 2013, Looker announced a Series A round of funding from [[Redpoint Ventures]], First Round Capital, and PivotNorth Capital, raising more than $18M.&lt;ref name="looker_series_a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pando.com/2013/08/13/looker-announces-16m-series-a-and-a-savvy-new-ceo-rise-above-stodgy-old-bi-solutions/ |title=Looker announces a $16M Series A and a savvy new CEO to rise above stodgy old BI solutions |author=Carney, Michael |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |publisher=PandoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Series A round, Looker raised $2M in a seed round from [[First Round Capital]] and [[PivotNorth Capital]].&lt;ref name="looker_series_a"/&gt; On March 11, 2015 Looker raised $30M in series B funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/11/looker-raises-30m-to-further-its-analytics-aims/ |title= Looker Raises $30M To Further Its Analytics Aims |author= Ben Kepes |work= Forbes |date= March 11, 2015 |access-date= August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July, 2015, Jen Grant joined as chief marketing officer, and the company estimated it has 140 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Fast-growing data analytics company Looker hires former Box exec Jen Grant |author= Dylan Tweney |date= July 1, 2015 |work= Venture Beat |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2016 Looker raised $48M in series C funding from [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers|Kleiner Perkins Claufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title =  Looker Series C Funding from Kleiner Perkins |work= Press release |publisher= Looker Data Sciences|url = http://www.looker.com/news/press/looker-secures-48-million-series-c-funding-from-kleiner-perkins |date= January 14, 2016  |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the company estimated 450 customers, including [[Jet.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Data analytics startup Looker raises $48 million, led by Kleiner Perkins |work= Venture Beat |author= Jordan Novet |date= January 14, 2016  |access-date = August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30th, 2017 Looker raised $81.5M in series D funding led by Capital G.

A '''mobile virtual network enabler''' ('''MVNE''') is a company that provides network infrastructure and related services, such as business support systems, administration and operations support systems to a [[Mobile Virtual Network Operator]] (MVNO).  This enables MVNOs to offer services to their own customers with their own brands. The MVNE does not have a relationship with consumers, but rather is a provider of network enablement platforms and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/mvne-mobile-virtual-network-enabler|title=Gartner Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MVNEs specialise in planning, implementation and management of mobile services. Typically this includes SIM provisioning and configuration, customer billing, customer relationship management and value-added service platforms. In effect, they enable an MVNO to outsource both the initial integration with the MNO and the ongoing business and technical operations management. A related type of company is [[mobile virtual network aggregator]], or MVNA. MVNE is a telecom solution, whereas MVNA is a business model which includes wholesale of an operator's airtime and routing of traffic over the MVNE's own switches. 

The benefits of using an MVNE include a reduction in the upfront capital expenses of an MVNO, financing arrangements offered by MVNEs to cover start-up costs and reduced wholesale airtime costs achieved through economies of scale of hosting multiple MVNOs on a single MVNE platform. The other benefits could be reduced operational expenses by outsourcing management of business and technical operations, smoother launch processes and benefiting from previous experience of the MVNE as a negotiating channel for smaller MVNOs to reach a wholesale agreement with the MNO.

However, not all MVNEs are the same. There is significant variation in the level of experience, technical capability, integration and operational support. Furthermore, using an MVNE may not be appropriate for all MVNOs. The considerations for this decision are manifold, however, some of the key reasons for an MVNO against using an MVNE are:
* The MVNO is large enough to achieve volume efficiency when going direct to the host operator (usually several hundred thousand subscribers);
* The brand and distribution channels are sufficiently strong to negotiate a joint-venture or direct relationship and obtain better margins;
* The MVNO has access to existing telecoms infrastructure, for example switches, international capacity, fixed infrastructure and billing platforms.

Adoption of the MVNE model will have a significant impact on the margins of an MVNO business, acting either to improve or shrink these margins relative to direct or self-build models. As such, the decision to use an MVNE should not be taken lightly as the impacts could range from customer experience to business efficiency.

The expression " operating lease" is somewhat confusing as it has a different meaning based on the context that is under consideration.
From a product characteristic stand point, this type of a lease, as distinguished from a finance lease, is one where the lessor takes residual risk. As such, the lease is non full payout. From an accounting stand point, this type of lease (if it fails to meet varied criteria that define a finance lease) results in off balance sheet financing.

The determination of whether a lease is a finance (also called capital) lease or an operating lease from an accounting point of view is defined in the United States by [http://www.fasb.org/pdf/fas13.pdf Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13)]. In countries covered by [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], the tests are defined in [http://www.ifrs.org/Documents/IAS17.pdf IAS 17]. In July 2006, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) and the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) announced the commencement of a joint project to comprehensively reconsider lease accounting. In July 2008, the boards decided to defer any changes to lessor accounting, while continuing with the project for lessee accounting, with the stated intention to recognise an asset and liability for all lessee leases (in essence, eliminating operating lease accounting). This culminated in the issuance of IFRS 16 and FASB Topic 842. Both are effective January 1,2019.The similarity in the two pronouncements is that leases, which previously qualified as operating leases- and hence resulted in off balance sheet treatment, are now to be capitalized by the lessee.

Unlike a finance lease, at the end of the operating lease the title to the asset does not pass to the lessee, but remains with the lessor. Accordingly, at the end of an operating lease, the lessee has several options:

*Return of the equipment
*Renewal of the lease 
*Purchase of the equipment

Operating leases, where the lessor takes a residual position, offer a host of benefits to the lessee the type of which finance leases do not

An '''operational system''' is a term used in [[data warehousing]] to refer to a system that is used to process the day-to-day transactions of an organization. These systems are designed in a manner that processing of day-to-day transactions is performed efficiently and the integrity of the transactional data is preserved.
== Synonyms ==
Sometimes operational systems are referred to as [[operational database]]s, [[transaction processing system]]s, or [[online transaction processing]] systems (OLTP). However, the use of the last two terms as synonyms may be confusing, because operational systems can be [[batch processing]] systems as well.

Any enterprise must necessarily maintain a lot of data about its operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1233">In [[law]], the '''ordinary course of business''' covers the usual transactions, customs and practices of a certain business and of a certain firm. This term is used particularly to judge the validity of certain transactions.  It is used in several different sections of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] of the United States.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/article1.htm#s1-201 Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code] defines a "Buyer in the ordinary course of business" by a four-part test:

# a person that buys goods in [[good faith]],
# without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;e.g. a [[security interest]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
# and in the ordinary course from a person, other than a [[pawnbroker]], '''in the business of selling goods of that kind'''.
# A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person '''comports with the usual or customary practices''' in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller's own usual or customary practices.

In [[Process philosophy|philosophy]], a '''process ontology''' refers to a universal model of the structure of the world as an ordered wholeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas}} Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sohst, Wolfgang|url=http://www.xenomoi.de/product_info.php/info/p180_NEU--Prozessontologie--Ein-systematischer-Entwurf-der-Entstehung-von-Existenz-.html|title=Prozessontologie.

Fundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to any [[empirical]] proof in itself, but to be a structural design pattern, out of which empirical [[phenomena]] can be explained and put together consistently. Throughout Western history, the dominating fundamental ontology is the so-called [[substance theory]]. However, fundamental process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times, because the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics spurred the development of a basic concept able to integrate such boundary notions as "[[energy]]," "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]", and those of the physical dimensions of [[space]] and [[time]].

In [[computer science]], a '''process ontology''' is a description of the components and their relationships that make up a process. A formal process ontology is an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the knowledge domain of processes. Often such ontologies take advantage of the benefits of an [[Upper ontology (information science)|upper ontology]]. [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning software]] can be used to perform plan generation based on the formal description of the process and its constraints. Numerous efforts have been made to define a process/planning ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/old/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|pages=9â26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==

A process may be defined as a set of transformations of input elements into output elements with specific properties, with the transformations characterized by parameters and constraints, such as in manufacturing or biology. A process may also be defined as the [[workflow]]s and [[sequence of events]] inherent in processes such as manufacturing, engineering and [[business process]]es.

== Ontologies ==

=== PSL ===
{{main|Process Specification Language}}
The Process Specification Language (PSL) is a process ontology developed for the formal description and modeling of basic manufacturing, engineering and business processes. This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level of event-instances, object-instances, and timepoints. PSLâs top level is built around the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Activity â a class or type of action, such as install-part, which is the class of actions in which parts are installed
* Activity-occurrence â an event or action that takes place at a specific place and time, such as a specific instance of install-part occurring at a specific [[timestamp]]
* Timepoint â a point in time
* Object â anything that is not a timepoint or an activity

=== Cyc ===
{{main|Cyc}}
In a process/planning ontology developed for the ontology Cyc, classes and relations above the ground level of PSL allow processes to be described purely at the type-level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|title=Process Representation and Planning in Cyc: From Scripts and Scenes to Constraints|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/plan01-ws.pdf|publisher=Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI), University of Edinburgh|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|first2=Jon|last2=Curtis&lt;!--|title=A Process Ontology--&gt;|title=Design of a Process Ontology: Vocabulary, Semantics, and Usage&lt;!--|url=http://www.cyc.com/doc/white_papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf--&gt;|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|work=Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management: Ontologies and the Semantic Web|year=2002|volume=2473|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|publisher=Springer|pages=263â270|doi=10.1007/3-540-45810-7_13|ISBN=978-3-540-44268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground level of PSL uses the primitives of event-instance, object-instance, and timepoint description. The types above the ground level of PSL have also been expressed in PSL, showing that the type-level and the ground level are relatively independent. The type-levels for the Cyc process ontology above this ground level use the following concepts:
* Process â formalized as a ''script''
* Aggregate process â a process at a level above that of a single episode of a process, to represent the numbers of participants in an action by ranges of integers and qualitative values like ''few'' or ''many''
* Script â a typical pattern of events that can be expected to re-occur
** a ''script'' has subevents, which means that ''scripts'' are composite events
* Scene â a subevent of a ''script''
* Roles/participants â specifies types of actors and objects that may play in the ''script'' or ''scene''
* Conditions â precondition(s) that must be true for a ''scene'' (event) to be executable, and postcondition(s) (effects) that must be true after a ''scene''
* Repetition â the number of repetitions of a process may be known, or may be unspecified, or may be repeated until a specific condition is true
* Properties of ordering and constitution of repeated subevents for composite processes:
** Begin-Ordered â subevents start at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** End-Ordered â subevents end at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** EndsBeforeEnd â subevents end before or at the same time as subevent instances which start before them
** Sequential â no overlapping subevents
** Terminating â there is a subevent after which no other subevents begin, and since all activities have a begin and end point, there is a time point at which the process ends
** Uniform â all subevents are of the same event type
* Identity â the identity of participants in a process, that actor(s) or object(s) playing a role in one ''scene'' or repetition are the same as those in another ''scene'' or repetition, is represented by constraints on possible participants

Together in DDPO, DOLCE and DnS are used to build a Plan Ontology that includes physical and non-physical objects (social entities, mental objects and states, conceptualizations, information objects, constraints), events, states, regions, qualities, and constructivist situations. The main target of DDPO is tasks, namely the types of actions, their sequencing, and the controls performed on them.

The ontology oXPDL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Marmolowski, Mateusz |author3=Oren, Eyal |author4=Gaaloul, Walid |title=A Process Ontology for Business Intelligence|url=http://www.deri.ie/fileadmin/documents/DERI-TR-2008-04-01.pdf|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a process interchange ontology based on the standardised XML Process Definition Language ([[XPDL]]). The purpose of oXPDL is to model the semantics of XPDL process models in standardized Web ontology languages such as [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] and [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], while incorporating features of existing standard ontologies such as [[Process Specification Language|PSL]], [[RosettaNet]], and [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|SUMO]].

=== GFO ===
{{main|General Formal Ontology}}
The General Formal Ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO)|url=http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo|publisher=Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=University of Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herre, Heinrich|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO): A Foundational Ontology for Conceptual Modelling|url=http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf|publisher=Research Department Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=IMISE University of Leipzig|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Upper ontology (information science)#General Formal Ontology .28GFO.29|GFO]]) is an ontology integrating processes and objects. GFO includes elaborations of categories like objects, processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories, such as the existence of atomic time-intervals vs. dense time. Two of the specialties of GFO are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category, a persistant{{sic}}. A persistant is a special category with the intention that its instances "remain identical" over time. With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called "time boundaries") are derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.

=== m3po and m3pl ===
The multi metamodel process ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Oren, Eyal |title=A process ontology to represent semantics of different process and choreography meta-models|url=http://www.m3pe.org/deliverables/process-ontology.pdf|location=National University of Ireland, Galway|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |author3=Kotinurmi, P. |title=m3po: An Ontology to Relate Choreographies to Workflow Models|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)|date=September 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3po.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (m3po) combines workflows and choreography descriptions so that it can be used as a process interchange ontology. For internal business processes, Workflow Management Systems are used for process modelling and allow describing and executing business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Georgakopoulos, D. |author2=Hornick,  M. |author3=Sheth, A. |title=An overview of workflow management: From process modeling to workflow automation infrastructure|journal=Distributed and Parallel Databases|volume=3|issue=2|pages=119â153|year=1995|doi=10.1007/bf01277643}}&lt;/ref&gt; For external business processes, choreography descriptions are used to describe how business partners can cooperate. A choreography can be considered to be a view of an internal business process with the internal logic not visible, similar to public views on private workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chiu, D. K. W.|title=Workflow view driven cross-organizational interoperability in a web service environment|journal=Inf.

The m3po ontology is written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]]. The related ontology m3pl, written in [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] using the extension FLOWS (First Order Logic for Web Services), enables the extraction of choreography interfaces from workflow models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |title=m3pl: A Work-FLOWS ontology extension to extract choreography interfaces|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantics for Business Process Management, in conjunction with ESWC2006|location=Budva, Montenegro|date=June 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3pl_sbpm2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The m3po ontology combines features of the following reference models and languages:
* [[XPDL]] â a standard for exchanging workflow models, without runtime information, between different workflow management systems
* [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] â an ontology that allows the capture of the semantics of workflow models and enables translations of models between workflow management systems
* [[YAWL]] â a research workflow language that supports all workflow patterns directly
* [[BPEL]] â an executable business process language and includes an abstract protocol
* [[WS-CDL]] â a multi-party collaboration model

The m3po ontology is organized using five key aspects of workflow specifications and workflow management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jablonski, S. |author2=Bussler, C. |title=Workflow Management: Modeling Concepts, Architecture and Implementation|publisher=International Thomson Computer Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different workflow models put a different emphasis on the five aspects, the most elaborate reference model for each aspect was used and combined into m3po.
* Functional and Behavioural â the most important concepts are ''processType'', ''processOccurrence'', ''activityType'' and ''activityOccurrence''
* Informational â defined by data and data-flow
* Organizational â defines who is responsible for carrying out a specific task; security related issues
* Operational â interaction of the workflows with their environment by manual tasks performed by users and automatic tasks performed by automated computer programs
* Orthogonal â scheduling based on time; integrity and failure recovery

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">A '''professional conference organiser''', '''professional congress organiser''' ('''PCO''') or '''conference company''' is a company which specialises in the organisation and management of congresses, conferences, seminars and similar events.

==Role==
PCOs can typically work as consultants for academic and professional associations. They usually provide full service management for conferences including conference design, [[abstract_management|abstract management software]], program development, registration, site and venue selection and booking, audiovisuals, IT support, logistics, leisure management, marketing, printing and web services, sourcing speakers, funding,  sponsorship and exhibitor sales, financial management and budget control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uKDnKFv3v0YC&amp;pg=PT322&amp;lpg=PT322&amp;dq=pco+conferences&amp;source=web&amp;ots=44eHJG8Ei5&amp;sig=ZQTKIwLhEwzOlMiEjG8Fx2b0y-4#PPT321,M1 Conferences and Conventions: A Global Industry By Tony Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies offer related services including travel agents and public relations companies. They tend to focus on limited areas such as destination management.

==Size of market sector==
Recent surveys of UK conference venues have found that a third of conference bookings were made by PCOs or venue-finding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC Information drawn from the British Conference Venues Survey 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100649/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf Survey of Conferences in Scotland in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070507/http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html Paid report in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (first part free)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207013830/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html |date=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 UK-based conferences generated Â£7.6 billion in direct sales giving PCOs a central role in some Â£2.5 billion of revenue generation. The UK is ranked second behind the US for global market share of conferences. Thus, although there is no one source of global statistics for the conference market it appears that PCOs play a central role in several billion dollars' worth of revenue generation worldwide.

'''SAS''' (previously "'''Statistical Analysis System'''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sas.com/en_us/company-information.html#history|title=About SAS|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a software suite developed by [[SAS Institute]] for advanced analytics, [[multivariate analyses]], [[business intelligence]], [[data management]], and [[predictive analytics]].

SAS was developed at [[North Carolina State University]] from 1966 until 1976, when SAS Institute was incorporated. SAS was further developed in the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of new statistical procedures, additional components and the introduction of [[JMP (statistical software)|JMP]]. A point-and-click interface was added in version 9 in 2004. A [[social media analytics]] product was added in 2010.

==Technical overview and terminology==
SAS is a software suite that can mine, alter, manage and retrieve data from a variety of sources and perform statistical analysis on it.&lt;ref name="encycl"/&gt; SAS provides a graphical point-and-click user interface for non-technical users and more advanced options through the [[SAS language]].&lt;ref name="encycl"&gt;
{{Cite journal | title = Encyclopedia of Research Design Encyclopedia of research design | doi = 10.4135/9781412961288 | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781412961271 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAS programs have DATA steps, which retrieve and manipulate data, and PROC steps, which analyze the data.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; Each step consists of a series of statements.&lt;ref name="DelwicheSlaughter2012"&gt;

| pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DATA step has executable statements that result in the software taking an action, and declarative statements that provide instructions to read a data set or alter the data's appearance.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; The DATA step has two phases: compilation and execution. In the compilation phase, declarative statements are processed and syntax errors are identified. Afterwards, the execution phase processes each executable statement sequentially.&lt;ref name="Li2013"&gt;

The PROC step consists of PROC statements that call upon named procedures. Procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics, analyses, and graphics. There are more than 300 procedures and each one contains a substantial body of programming and statistical work.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt; PROC statements can also display results, sort data or perform other operations.&lt;ref name="DelwicheSlaughter2012"/&gt;

SAS macros are pieces of code or variables that are coded once and referenced to perform repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name="BassSolutions2007"&gt;

===Development===
SAS was re-designed in SAS 76 with an [[open architecture]] that allowed for [[compilers]] and procedures. The INPUT and INFILE statements were improved so they could read most data formats used by IBM mainframes. Generating reports was also added through the PUT and FILE statements. The ability to analyze [[general linear model]]s was also added&lt;ref&gt;

Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt;

SAS version 4 had limited features, but made SAS more accessible. Version 5 introduced a complete macro language, array subscripts, and a full-screen interactive user interface called Display Manager.&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt; In 1985, SAS was rewritten in the [[C programming language]]. This allowed for the SAS' Multivendor Architecture that allows the software to run on [[UNIX]], [[MS-DOS]], and [[Windows]]. It was previously written in [[PL/I]], [[Fortran]], and [[assembly language]].&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="expert"/&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, SAS released a number of components to complement Base SAS. SAS/GRAPH, which produces graphics, was released in 1980, as well as the SAS/ETS component, which supports econometric and time series analysis. A component intended for pharmaceutical users, SAS/PH-Clinical, was released in the 1990s. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] standardized on SAS/PH-Clinical for new drug applications in 2002.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;

In a 2005 article for the ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'' comparing statistical packages from SAS and its competitors [[Stata]] and [[SPSS]], Alan C. Acock wrote that SAS programs provide "extraordinary range of data analysis and data management tasks," but were [[Usability|difficult to use]] and learn.&lt;ref name="Acock"/&gt; SPSS and Stata, meanwhile, were both easier to learn (with better documentation) but had less capable analytic abilities, though these could be expanded with paid (in SPSS) or free (in Stata) add-ons. Acock concluded that SAS was best for [[power user]]s, while occasional users would benefit most from SPSS and Stata.&lt;ref name="Acock"&gt;{{cite journal|pages=1093â1095|title=SAS, Stata, SPSS: A Comparison |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00196.x|volume=67|issue=4 |date=November 2005 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00196.x/full | last=Acock |first=Alan C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], gave similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/compare_packages.htm |title=Compare Packages |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitors such as [[Revolution Analytics]] and [[Alpine Data Labs]] advertise their products as considerably cheaper than SAS'. In a 2011 comparison, Doug Henschen of ''[[InformationWeek]]'' found that start-up fees for the three are similar, though he admitted that the starting fees were not necessarily the best basis for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/low-cost-options-for-predictive-analytics-challenge-sas-ibm/d/d-id/1099191?page_number=1 |title=Low-Cost Options For Predictive Analytics Challenge SAS, IBM|first=Dough |last=Henschen |work=InformationWeek|date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAS' business model is not weighted as heavily on initial fees for its programs, instead focusing on revenue from annual subscription fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SAS' revenue up 12% in 2011|work=The News &amp; Observer, |location= Raleigh, North Carolina |date=January 20, 2012 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/01/20/1790587/sas-revenue-up-12-in-2011.html|last=Ranii|first=David |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoftBus"&gt;{{cite web|last=Turchin|first=Brian|title=SAS Profile -- Going Its Own Way|url=http://www.cabnr.unr.edu/gf/apst650/sassoftbusiness.pdf|publisher=Software Business Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F. Taylor 1856-1915.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] (1856â1915), leading proponent of scientific management]]

'''Scientific management''' is a theory of [[management]] that [[Analysis|analyzes]] and [[wikt:synthesis#Noun|synthesizes]] [[workflow]]s. Its main objective is improving [[economic efficiency]], especially [[Workforce productivity|labour productivity]]. It was one of the earliest attempts [[applied science|to apply science]] to the [[engineering]] of [[business process|process]]es and to management. Scientific management is sometimes known as '''Taylorism''' after its founder, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]].&lt;ref name="Mitcham05p1153"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mitcham|2005|p=1153}} Mitcham, Carl and Adam, Briggle ''Management'' in Mitcham (2005) p. 1153&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor began the theory's development in the [[United States]] during the 1880s and '90s within [[manufacturing]] industries, especially steel. Its peak of influence came in the 1910s;&lt;ref name=Wodham1997p12&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodham|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor died in 1915 and by the 1920s, scientific management was still influential but had entered into [[competition]] and [[syncretism]] with opposing or complementary ideas.

Although scientific management as a distinct theory or school of thought was obsolete by the 1930s, most of its themes are still important parts of [[industrial engineering]] and management today. These include: analysis; synthesis; [[logic]]; [[rationality]]; [[empiricism]]; [[work ethic]]; efficiency and [[waste reduction|elimination of waste]]; [[standardization]] of [[best practice]]s; disdain for tradition preserved merely for its own sake or to protect the [[social status]] of particular workers with particular skill sets; the transformation of [[craft production]] into [[mass production]]; and [[knowledge transfer]] between workers and from workers into tools, processes, and documentation.

== Name ==
Taylor's own names for his approach initially included "shop management" and "[[process management]]". However, "scientific management" came to national attention in 1910 when crusading attorney [[Louis Brandeis]] (then not yet Supreme Court justice) popularized the term.&lt;ref name="Drury1915pp15-21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924002406647#page/n19/mode/2up/search/Brandeis+find+scientific+management pp. 15â21]&lt;/ref&gt; Brandeis had sought a consensus term for the approach with the help of practitioners like [[Henry L. Gantt]] and [[Frank B. Gilbreth]]. Brandeis then used the consensus of "scientific management" when he argued before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)]] that a proposed increase in railroad rates was unnecessary despite an increase in labor costs; he alleged scientific management would overcome railroad inefficiencies (The ICC ruled against the rate increase, but also dismissed as insufficiently substantiated that concept the railroads were necessarily inefficient.) Taylor recognized the nationally-known term "scientific management" as another good name for the concept, and adopted it in the title of [[The Principles of Scientific Management (monograph)|his influential 1911 monograph]].

== History ==
The [[Midvale Steel Company]], "one of America's great armor plate making plants," was the birthplace of scientific management. In 1877, at age 22, Frederick W. Taylor started as a clerk in Midvale, but advanced to foreman in 1880. As foreman, Taylor was "constantly impressed by the failure of his [team members] to produce more than about one-third of [what he deemed] a good day's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor determined to discover, by scientific methods, how long it should take men to perform each given piece of work; and it was in the fall of 1882 that he started to put the first features of scientific management into operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Horace Bookwalter Drury]], in his 1918 work, ''Scientific management: A History and Criticism'', identified seven other leaders in the movement,  most of whom learned of and extended scientific management from Taylor's efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B.

* [[Carl G. Barth]] (1860â1939) 
* [[Horace K. Hathaway]] (1878â1944) 
* [[Morris Llewellyn Cooke|Morris L. Cooke]] (1872â1960)
* [[Sanford E. Thompson]] (1867â1949)
* [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank B. Gilbreth]] (1868â1924). Gilbreth's independent work on "motion study" is on record as early as 1885; after meeting Taylor in 1906 and being introduced to scientific management, Gilbert devoted his efforts to introducing scientific management into factories. Gilbreth and his wife Dr [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878â1972) performed micro-motion studies using stop-motion cameras as well as developing the profession of industrial/organizational psychology. 
* [[Harrington Emerson]] (1853â1931) began determining what industrial plants' products and costs were compared to what they ought to be in 1895. Emerson did not meet Taylor until December 1900, and the two never worked together.

Emerson's testimony in late 1910 to the Interstate Commerce Commission brought the movement to national attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By January 1911, a leading railroad journal began a series of articles denying they were inefficiently managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B.

When steps were taken to introduce scientific management at the government-owned [[Rock Island Arsenal]] in early 1911, it was opposed by [[Samuel Gompers]], founder and President of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (an alliance of [[craft unions]]). When a subsequent attempt was made to introduce the bonus system into the government's [[Watertown Arsenal]] foundry during the summer of 1911, the entire force walked out for a few days. Congressional investigations followed, resulting in a ban on the use of time studies and pay premiums in Government service.

Taylor's death in 1915 at age 59&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0320.html|title=F. W. Taylor, Expert in Efficiency, Dies|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; left the movement without its original leader. In management literature today, the term "scientific management" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples ("classical", implying "no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. Today, task-oriented optimization of work tasks is nearly ubiquitous in industry.

== Pursuit of economic efficiency ==
Flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th century, scientific management built on earlier pursuits of [[economic efficiency]]. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of [[wikt:thrift#Noun|thrift]], it favored [[Empiricism|empirical methods]] to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus it was followed by a profusion of successors in applied science, including [[time and motion study]], the [[Efficiency Movement]] (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), [[Fordism]], [[operations management]], [[operations research]], [[industrial engineering]], [[management science]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[logistics]], [[business process management]], [[business process reengineering]], [[lean manufacturing]], and [[Six Sigma]]. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.

Taylor rejected the notion, which was universal in his day and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by [[craft production]] methods. In the course of his empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of [[manual labour|manual labor]]. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; [[material handling equipment]] as we know it today was mostly not developed yet. He looked at [[shovel]]ing in the unloading of [[railroad car]]s full of [[ore]]; lifting and carrying in the moving of [[pig iron|iron pigs]] at steel mills; the manual inspection of [[ball (bearing)|bearing balls]]; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"/&gt;

Subsequent forms of scientific management were articulated by Taylor's disciples, such as [[Henry Gantt]]; other engineers and managers, such as [[Benjamin S. Graham]]; and other theorists, such as [[Max Weber]]. Taylor's work also contrasts with other efforts, including those of [[Henri Fayol]] and those of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth, Sr.]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (whose views originally shared much with Taylor's but later diverged in response to Taylorism's inadequate handling of human relations).

== Soldiering ==

Scientific management requires a high level of managerial control over employee work practices and entails a higher ratio of managerial workers to laborers than previous management methods. Such detail-oriented management may cause friction between workers and managers.

Taylor observed that some workers were more talented than others, and that even smart ones were often unmotivated. He observed that most [[worker]]s who are forced to perform repetitive tasks tend to work at the slowest rate that goes unpunished. This slow rate of work has been observed in many industries and many countries&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=13â14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called by various terms.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp19,23,82,95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=19, 23, 82, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor used the term "soldiering",&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soldier|title=Definition of SOLDIER|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term that reflects the way [[Conscription|conscripts]] may approach following orders, and observed that, when paid the same amount, workers will tend to do the amount of work that the slowest among them does.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911|pp=13â29, 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor describes soldiering as "the greatest evil with which the working-people ... are now afflicted."&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"/&gt;

This reflects the idea that workers have a vested interest in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one [[Best practice|best method]] for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their [[productivity]] would go up.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"/&gt; Thus his compensation plans usually included [[piece work|piece rates]]. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.

== Relationship to mechanization and automation ==
[[File:Musterarbeitsplatz.png|thumb|A machinist at the Tabor Company, a firm where Frederick Taylor's consultancy was applied to practice, about 1905]]

Scientific management evolved in an era when [[mechanization]] and [[automation]] were still in their infancy. The ideas and methods of scientific management extended the [[American system of manufacturing]] in the transformation from [[craft production|craft]] work (with humans as the only possible agents) to mechanization and automation, although proponents of scientific management did not predict the extensive removal of humans from the production process. Concerns over [[Technological unemployment|labor-displacing technologies]] rose with increasing mechanization and automation.

By factoring processes into discrete, unambiguous units, scientific management laid the groundwork for automation and [[offshoring]], prefiguring [[industrial control systems|industrial process control]] and [[numerical control]] in the absence of any machines that could carry it out. Taylor and his followers did not foresee this at the time; in their world, it was ''humans'' that would execute the optimized processes. (For example, although in their era the instruction "open valve A whenever pressure gauge B reads over value X" would be carried out by a human, the fact that it had been reduced to an algorithmic component paved the way for a machine to be the agent.) However, one of the common threads between their world and ours is that the agents of execution need not be "smart" to execute their tasks. In the case of computers, they are ''not able'' (yet) to be "smart" (in that sense of the word); in the case of human workers under scientific management, they were often ''able'' but were ''not allowed''. Once the time-and-motion men had completed their studies of a particular task, the workers had very little opportunity for further thinking, experimenting, or suggestion-making. They were forced to "play dumb" most of the time, which occasionally led to revolts.

The middle ground between the craft production of skilled workers and full automation is occupied by systems of extensive mechanization and partial automation operated by semiskilled and unskilled workers. Such systems depend on algorithmic workflows and [[knowledge transfer]], which require substantial engineering to succeed. Although Taylor's intention for scientific management was simply to optimize work methods, the process engineering that he pioneered also tends to build the skill into the equipment and processes, removing most need for skill in the workers. Such engineering has governed most industrial engineering since then. It is also the essence of successful offshoring. The common theme in all these cases is that businesses engineer their way out of their need for large concentrations of skilled workers, and the high-wage environments that sustain them. This creates competitive advantage on the local level of individual firms, although the pressure it exerts systemically on [[employment]] and [[employability]] is an [[externality]].

== Impact ==

=== Market economies ===

==== Taylor's view of workers ====

Taylor often expressed views of workers that may be considered insulting.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized differences between workers, stressed the need to select the right person for the right job, and championed the workers by advocating frequent breaks and good pay for good work.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911pp13-29,95"/&gt; He often failed to conceal his condescending attitude towards less intelligent workers, describing them as "stupid" and comparing them to draft animals in that they have to have their tasks managed for them in order to work efficiently.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911p59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1911,}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoJMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other thinkers soon offered more ideas on the roles that workers play in mature industrial systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just the needs of the whole. [[James Hartness]] published ''The Human Factor in Works Management''&lt;ref name="Hartness1912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hartness|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, while [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The [[Human Relations Movement|human relations]] school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures.&lt;ref name="Braverman_1998_1974"&gt;{{Harvnb|Braverman|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly, a [[syncretism]] has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.

==== Taylorism, anomie, and unions ====

With the division of labor that became commonplace as Taylorism was implemented in manufacturing, workers lost their sense of connection to the production of goods. Workers began to feel disenfranchised with the monotonous and unfulfilling work they were doing in factories. Before scientific management, workers felt a sense of pride when completing their good, which went away when workers only completed one part of production. "The further 'progress' of industrial development... increased the anomic or forced division of labor," the opposite of what Taylor thought would be the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melossi|first1=Dario|title=Controlling Crime, Controlling Society: Thinking about Crime in Europe and America|date=December 2008|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial adoption of Taylor's principles by management seeking to boost efficiency, while ignoring principles such as fair pay and direct engagement by managers, led to further tensions and the rise of unions to represent workers needs.

Taylor had a largely negative view of unions, and believed they only led to decreased productivity. Although he opposed them, his work with scientific management led disenfranchised workers to look to unions for support.

==== Early decades: Making jobs unpleasant ====

Under scientific management, the demands of work intensified. Workers became dissatisfied with the work environment and became angry.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} During one of Taylor's own implementations at the [[Watertown Arsenal]] in Massachusetts, a [[Strike action|strike]] led to an investigation of Taylor's methods by a U.S. House of Representatives committee. The committee reported in 1912, concluding that scientific management did provide some useful techniques and offered valuable organizational suggestions,{{Request quotation|date=April 2011}} but that it also gave production managers a dangerously high level of uncontrolled power.&lt;ref name="Mullins2004p70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullins|2004|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After an attitude survey of the workers revealed a high level of resentment and hostility towards scientific management, the Senate banned Taylor's methods at the arsenal.&lt;ref name="Mullins2004p70"/&gt;

Scientific management lowered worker morale and exacerbated existing conflicts between labor and management. As a consequence, the method inadvertently strengthened [[labor union]]s and their bargaining power in labor disputes,&lt;ref name="Drury1915pp170-174"&gt;
{{Harvnb|Drury|1915|pp=170â174}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby neutralizing most or all of the benefit of any productivity gains it had achieved. Thus its net benefit to owners and management ended up as small or negative. It took new efforts, borrowing some ideas from scientific management but mixing them with others, to produce more productive formula.

==== Later decades: Making jobs disappear ====

Scientific management may have exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: the erosion of employment in developed economies via both [[offshoring]] and automation. Both were made possible by the deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the [[knowledge transfer]] that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been [[commodification|commoditized]], and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to [[perfect competition|pure]] than it had been, depressing wages and [[job security]]. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to othersâwhich could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of [[automation]],&lt;ref name="Noble1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Noble|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; hastening the onset of the later stages just described.

In a central assumption of scientific management, "the worker was taken for granted as a cog in the machinery."&lt;ref name="Rosen1993p139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1993|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; While scientific management had made jobs unpleasant, its successors made them less remunerative, less secure, and finally nonexistent as a consequence of [[structural unemployment]].

==== Relationship to Fordism ====

It is often assumed that [[Fordism]] derives from Taylor's work. Taylor apparently made this assumption himself when visiting the [[Ford Motor Company]]'s Michigan plants not too long before he died, but it is likely that the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp249-253"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=249â253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles E. Sorensen]], a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until [[Henry Ford II]] took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. [[Henry Ford]] felt that he had succeeded ''in spite of'', not ''because of'', experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts.&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956p41"/&gt; Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor [[Walter Flanders]] in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the [[efficiency movement]] during the decade of 1905-1915.

=== Planned economies ===

Scientific management appealed to managers of [[planned economy|planned economies]] because [[Economic planning|central economic planning]] relies on the idea that the expenses that go into economic production can be precisely predicted and can be optimized by design. The opposite theoretical pole would be [[laissez-faire]] thinking in which the [[invisible hand]] of free markets is the only possible "designer". In reality most economies today are somewhere in between. Another alternative for economic planning is [[workers' self-management]].

==== Soviet Union ====

In the [[Soviet Union]], Taylorism was advocated by [[Aleksei Gastev]] and ''nauchnaia organizatsia truda'' (''the movement for the scientific organisation of labor''). It found support in both [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]]. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939.&lt;ref name="Beissinger1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beissinger|1988|pp=35â37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. As scientific management was believed to epitomize American efficiency,&lt;ref name="Hughes_2004_1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]] even claimed that "the combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of [[Leninism]]."&lt;ref name="Hughes_2004_1989_p251"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2004|p=251}}, quoting Stalin 1976 p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sorensen was one of the consultants who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era,&lt;ref name="Sorensen1956pp193-216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=193â216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Cold War]] made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. [[Anti-communism]] had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and [[anti-capitalism]] in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.

==== East Germany ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-19361-006, Chemnitz, Normierung im FrÃ¤smaschinenwerkes "Fritz Heckert".jpg|thumb|East German machine tool builders, 1953.]]

By the 1950s, scientific management had grown dated, but its goals and practices remained attractive and were also being adopted by the [[German Democratic Republic]] as it sought to increase efficiency in its industrial sectors. In the accompanying photograph from the [[German Federal Archives]], workers discuss standards specifying how each task should be done and how long it should take. The workers are engaged in a state-planned instance of process improvement, but they are pursuing the same goals that were contemporaneously pursued in [[Capitalism|capitalist]] societies, as in the [[Toyota Production System]].

== Organized labor reactions ==
In 1911, organized labor erupted with strong opposition to scientific management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924002406647|title=Scientific management; a history and criticism|first=Horace B. (Horace Bookwalter)|last=Drury|date=29 January 2018|publisher=New York, Columbia university; [etc., etc.]|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;, spreading from [[Samuel Gompers]], founder and president of the American Federal of Labor (AFL), in the US to far around the globe. By 1913 [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote that the "most widely discussed topic today in Europe, and to some extent in Russia, is the 'system' of the American engineer, Frederick Taylor"; Lenin decried it as merely a "'scientific' system of sweating" more work from laborers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/13.htm|title=Lenin: A 'Scientific' System of Sweating|first=V.I.|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1914, Lenin derided Taylorism as "manâs enslavement by the machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/mar/13.htm|title=Lenin: The Taylor SystemâMan's Enslavement by the Machine|first=V.I.|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[Russian Revolutions]] brought him to power, Lenin wrote in 1918 that the "Russian is a bad worker [who must] learn to work. The Taylor system... is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1918/mar/x03.htm|title=The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote box
 |quote = [The early US history of labor relations with scientific management was described by Dr Drury thusly:] ...for a long time there was thus little or no direct [conflict] between scientific management and organized labor... [However] One of the best known experts once spoke to us with satisfaction of the manner in which, in a certain factory where there had been a number of union men, the labor organization had, upon the introduction of scientific management, gradually disintegrated. 

...From 1882 (when the system was started) until 1911, a period of approximately thirty years, there was not a single strike under it, and this in spite of the fact that it was carried on primarily in the steel industry, which was subject to a great many disturbances. For instance, in the [[Philadelphia general strike (1910)|general strike in Philadelphia]], one man only went out at the Tabor plant [managed by Taylor], while at the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin Locomotive]] shops across the street two thousand struck.

...Serious opposition may be said to have been begun in 1911, immediately after certain testimony presented before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] [by Harrington Emerson] revealed to the country the strong movement setting towards scientific management. National labor leaders, wide-awake as to what might happen in the future, decided that the new movement was a menace to their organization, and at once inaugurated an attack... centered about the installation of scientific management in the [[Watertown Arsenal|government arsenal at Watertown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Watertown Arsenal in Massachusetts provides an example of the application and repeal of the Taylor system in the workplace, due to worker opposition.  In the early 2001, neglect in the Watertown shops included overcrowding, dim-lighting, lack of tools and equipment, and questionable management strategies in the eyes of the workers. Frederick W. Taylor and Carl G. Barth visited Watertown in April 1909 and reported on their observations at the shops. Their conclusion was to apply the Taylor system of management to the shops to produce better results.  Efforts to install the Taylor system began in June 1909.  Over the years of time study and trying to improve the efficiency of workers, criticisms began to evolve.  Workers complained of having to compete with one another, feeling strained and resentful, and feeling excessively tired after work.  There is, however, no evidence that the times enforced were unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aitken|1985}}, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2017}} In June 1913, employees of the Watertown Arsenal petitioned to abolish the practice of scientific management there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; A number of magazine writers inquiring into the effects of scientific management found that the "conditions in shops investigated contrasted favorably with those in other plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuing current reactions==
{{criticism section|date=February 2017}}

[[Criticism]] of Taylor's principles of effective [[workmanship]] and the [[productivity]] of the workers continues today. Often, his theories are described as man-contemptuous and portrayed as now overhauled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= F. W. Taylor und der Taylorismus. Ãber das Wirken und die Lehre Taylors und die Kritik am Taylorismus.|last= Hebeisen|first= W.|publisher= |year= 1999|isbn= |location= ZÃ¼rich: vdf Hochschulverlag AG.|pages= 7|quote= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the principles of Taylor are still being pursued by [[Kaizen]] and [[Six Sigma]] and similar methodologies, which are based on the development of working methods and courses based on systematic [[analysis]] rather than relying on tradition and rule of thumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= F. W. Taylor und der Taylorismus. Ãber das Wirken und die Lehre Taylors und die Kritik am Taylorismus.|last= Hebeisen|first= W.|publisher= |year=1999|isbn= |location= ZÃ¼rich: vdf Hochschulverlag AG.|pages= 188|quote= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism is, according to Stephen P. Waring, considered very controversial, despite its popularity.  It is often{{quantify|date=June 2017}} criticized for turning the worker into an "automaton" or "machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drury|1915}}, pp. 195â198&lt;/ref&gt; Due to techniques employed with scientific management, employees claim to have become overworked and were hostile to the process. Criticisms commonly came from workers who were subjected to an accelerated work pace, lower standards of workmanship, lower product-quality, and lagging wages.  Workers defied being reduced to such machines, and objected to the practices of Taylorism. Many workers formed unions, demanded higher pay, and went on strike to be free of control issues.  This ignited [[class conflict]], which Taylorism was initially meant{{by whom|date=June 2017}} to prevent.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  Efforts to resolve the conflicts included methods of scientific collectivism, making agreements with unions, and the [[personnel management]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waring|1991}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of 1960 some [[Countermovement|counter-movements]] to Taylorism arose.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Representatives of the so-called [[Human relations movement|Human Relations movement]] urged humanization and democratization of the working world. The criticism of Taylorism supports the unilateral approach of [[labour economics|labor]]. Strictly speaking, Taylorism is not a scientific theory. All theories of F. W. Taylor are based on experiments. On the basis of samples, conclusions were made, which were then generalized. There is no [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]] of the selected sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.klett.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=terrasse_artikel__layout__pdf&amp;art_id=1010818|title= Infoblatt Taylorismus.

Another reason for criticizing Taylor's methods stemmed from Taylor's belief that the [[scientific method]] included the calculations of exactly how much time it takes a man to do a particular task, or his rate of work.  However, the opposition to this argument is that such a calculation relies on certain arbitrary, non-scientific decisions such as what constituted the job, which men were timed, and under which conditions.  Any of these factors are subject to change, and therefore can produce inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aitken|1985}}, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dismiss so-called "scientific management"/Taylorism as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = Meanwhile, the pseudo-science of Taylorism justified heightened outside surveillance of the laboring body, positing a rational 'technology of the productive human body' [...]. Significantly, Taylorism altered previous Cartesian notion of the body as a kind of working machine by redefining 'work' in the more narrow sense used in physics, as 'force working against resistance' [...].

== Legacy ==

Scientific management was one of the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem. It may have been the first to do so in a "bottom-up" way and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. With the advancement of statistical methods, [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into [[operations management]], [[operations research]], and management [[cybernetics]]. In the 1980s [[total quality management]] became widely popular, and in the 1990s "re-engineering" went from a simple word to a mystique. Today's [[Six Sigma]] and [[lean manufacturing]] could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their [[cultural evolution|evolutionary]] distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, [[Shigeo Shingo]], one of the originators of the [[Toyota Production System]], believed that this system and [[Japanese management culture]] in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Peter Drucker]] saw Frederick Taylor as the creator of [[knowledge management]], because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes. Although the typical application of scientific management was manufacturing, Taylor himself advocated scientific management for all sorts of work, including the management of universities and government. For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to "the work of our salesmen".  Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using Taylorism for "sales engineering"&lt;ref name="Dawson2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Person was talking about what is now called [[sales process engineering]]âengineering the processes that [[sales]]people useânot about what we call [[sales engineering]] today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate [[marketing]].

Google's methods of increasing productivity and output can be seen to be influenced by Taylorism as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Nicholas G.|title=The Shallows|date=June 2010|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silicon Valley company is a forerunner in applying behavioral science to increase knowledge worker productivity. In classic scientific management as well as  approaches like lean management or business process reengineering leaders and experts develop and define standard. Leading high-tech companies use the concept of nudge management to increase productivity of employees. More and more business leaders start to make use of this new scientific management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Philip|last2=Freibichler|first2=Wolfgang|year=2017|title=Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity|url=http://jorgdesign.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41469-017-0014-1|journal=Journal of Organization Design|volume=6:4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[Military|militaries]] employ all of the major goals and tactics of scientific management, if not under that name. Of the key points, all but wage incentives for increased output are used by modern military organizations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Wage incentives rather appear in the form of skill bonuses for enlistments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Scientific management has had an important influence in sports, where stop watches and motion studies rule the day. (Taylor himself enjoyed sports, especially tennis and golf. He and a partner won a national championship in doubles tennis. He invented improved tennis racquets and improved golf clubs, although other players liked to tease him for his unorthodox designs, and they did not catch on as replacements for the mainstream implements).&lt;ref name="Kanigel1997"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kanigel|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern human resources can be seen to have begun in the scientific management era, most notably in the writings of [[Katherine M. H. Blackford]], who was also a proponent of [[eugenics]].

Practices descended from scientific management are currently used in offices and in medicine (e.g. [[managed care]]) as well.&lt;ref name="Head2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Head|2005|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the tendency to overcome Taylorism is very great. The trend is moving away from assembly line work, since people are increasingly being replaced by [[machine]]s in production plants and sub-processes are [[Automation|automated]], so that human labor is not necessary in these cases. The desire for automated [[workflow]] in companies is intended to reduce costs and support the company at the operational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Business Process Management.|last=Dumas, M., La Rosa, M., Mendling, J. &amp; Reijers, H.|first=|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=Berlin Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=372|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it can be observed that many companies try to make the [[workplace]] as comfortable as possible for the [[employees]]. This is achieved by light flooded rooms, [[Feng shui|Feng Shui]] methods in the workplace or even by creative jobs. The efficiency and creativity of the employees is to be promoted by a pleasant atmosphere at the workplace. Approaches of the Scientific Management, in which attempts are also made to make the work environment pleasant, are partly recognizable here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/karriere/ausland/jobs-im-silicon-valley-arbeiten-bei-google-facebook-evernote-a-965811.html|title=Arbeiten im Silicon Valley.

In the works of Gouldner and Crozier, the recognition of the plurality of [[industrial society|industrial]] forms is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geschichte des organisatorischen Denkens|last=Bonazzi|first=G.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Wiesbaden: Springer Fachmedien.|pages=261|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, we have a modern corporate management, where managers are given the available positions in [[Company|companies]] and are given the right to take legal action.&lt;ref name="Freriks 1996 117"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Modelle der BetriebsgrÃ¶Ãe im Maschinenbau. Koordination und Kontrollmechanismen bei organisatorischem Wachstum.|last=Freriks|first=R.|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=Opladen: Leske+ Budrich.|pages=117|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working world of the 21st century is mainly based on [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]]. This is derived from quality control. In contrast to Taylorism, by which products are produced in the shortest possible time without any form of quality control and delivered to the end customer, the focus in the 21st century is on quality control at TQM. In order to avoid error rates, it is necessary to hire [[Expert|specialists]] to check all the products which have been manufactured before they are delivered to the end customer. The quality controls have improved over time, and incorrect partial processes can be detected in time and removed from the production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=EinfÃ¼hrung in das Management von GeschÃ¤ftsprozessen.|last=Koch|first=S.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism approaches are largely prevalent in companies where machines can not perform certain activities. Certain subprocesses are still to be carried out by humans, such as the sorting out of damaged fruit in the final process before the goods are packed by machines. It turns out that the quality control is ultimately to be verified by the individual man. Certain activities remain similar to the approach of Taylorism. There are no "zero error programs", employees have to be trained and thus reduce error rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=EinfÃ¼hrung in das Management von GeschÃ¤ftsprozessen. Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|last=Koch|first=S.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=Berling Heidelberg: Springer Verlag.|pages=185|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[invention]] of the management one managed positions, which are equipped with disposition rights. The positions are occupied by paid employees and form the basis for the current, modern [[Management|corporate management.]] In order to be able to perceive these positions, it was no longer necessary to bring in resources such as capital, but instead [[job qualification|qualification]]s were necessary. Written rights are also passed on to employees, which means that the leaders of an organization tend to fall into the background and merely have a passive position.&lt;ref name="Freriks 1996 117"/&gt;

The structure and size of a company must be distinguished. Depending on which dispositions are predominant, the size of the company, the sector, and the number of employees in an organization, one can examine whether approaches of Taylorism are prevalent. It is believed to be predominant in the automotive industry. In spite of the fact that a lot of activities have been replaced by machines during the production, it is ultimately the person who can check the [[quality (business)|quality]] of a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theoretische Modelle der BetriebsgrÃ¶Ãe im Maschinenbau. Koordination und Kontrollmechanismen bei organisatorischem Wachstum.|last=Freriks|first=R.|publisher=1996|year=|isbn=|location=Opladen: Leske+ Budrich.|pages=114|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylorism led to a [[performance]] increase in companies. All superfluous working steps are avoided. The company benefits from the [[productivity]] of the workers and this in turn from higher [[wage]]s. Unused productivity resources were effectively exploited by Taylorism.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1â2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humanisierung der Arbeit. Neue Formen der Arbeitsgestaltung als Determinante von Arbeitszufriedenheit am Beispiel teilautonomer Arbeitsgruppen.|last=Von Berg|first=A.|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=Georg- August UniversitÃ¤t: GÃ¶ttingen.|pages=1â2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's work environment in the 21st century benefits from the [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]] of working conditions. Corporate [[Strategy|strategies]] are increasingly focused on the flexibility of work. Flexible adaptation to demand should be possible. The qualifications of the employees, the work content as well as the work processes are determined by the competition situation on the market. The aim is to promote [[Discipline|self-discipline]] and the [[motivation]] of employees in order to achieve their own tasks and at the same time to prevent [[wikt:monotonous|monotonous]] work. Technical progress has led to more humane working conditions since inhumane work steps are done by the [[machine]]s.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1â2"/&gt;

Taylorism's approach is called [[wikt:inhuman|inhuman]]. The increased wage alone is not a permanent incentive for the workers to carry out the same monotonous work. Worker-friendly work structures are required. People no longer want to be perceived merely as executive organ. The complete separation from [[manual labor|manual]] and [[Headworks|headwork]] leads to a lack of [[pleasure]] in the execution of the work steps.&lt;ref name="Von Berg 2009 1â2"/&gt;

In the 21st century the rising level of [[education]] leads to better trained workers, but the [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] [[pressure]] also rises. The interplay of [[Economy|economic]] as well as the pressure to innovate also lead to uncertainty among employees. The national diseases in the 21st century have become [[Occupational burnout|burn-out]] phenomena and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]s, often in conjunction with the [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and the increased performance pressure in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humanisierung der Arbeit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16173">'''Shared services''' is the provision of a service by one part of an organization or group, where that service had previously been found, in more than one part of the organization or group. Thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider. The key here is the idea of 'sharing' within an organization or group. This sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider. The provider, on the other hand, needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures ([[Performance indicator|KPI]]s, cost, quality etc.).

== Overviews ==
Shared services is similar to collaboration that might take place between different organizations such as a Hospital Trust or a Police Force. For example, adjacent Trusts might decide to collaborate by merging their HR or IT functions.

There are two arguments for sharing services:&lt;ref name="thesystemsthinkingreview18"&gt;[http://www.thesystemsthinkingreview.co.uk/index.php?pg=18&amp;utwkstoryid=266 Why do we believe in economy of scale?]. Thesystemsthinkingreview.co.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The âless of a common resource' argument and the âefficiency through industrialization' argument. The former is âobvious': if you have fewer managers, IT systems, buildings etc; if you use less of some resource, it will reduce costs. The second argument is âefficiency through industrializationâ. This argument assumes that efficiencies follow from specialization and standardization â resulting in the creation of âfront' and âback' offices. The typical method is to simplify, standardize and then centralize, using an IT 'solution' as the means.

Shared services is different from the model of [[outsourcing]], which is where an external third party is paid to provide a service that was previously internal to the buying organization, typically leading to redundancies and re-organization. There is an ongoing debate about the advantages of shared services over [[outsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/30/78681_23OPreality_1.html Outsourcing vs. shared services | InfoWorld | Column | 2006-05-30 | By Ephraim Schwartz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115115454/http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/30/78681_23OPreality_1.html |date=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/item/?ci=18405 Shared Services vs. Outsourcing | IT Business Edge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029160946/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/item/?ci=18405 |date=2006-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.capgemini.com/news/current_news.asp?ID=441&amp;PRyear=2004 Capgemini U.S. | Jury Is Still Out On Outsourcing Versus Shared Services As Dominant Service Delivery Model, Says Capgemini Survey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.109.6832 | last1 = Janssen | first1 = M. | last2 = Joha | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Motives for Establishing Shared Service Centers in Public Administrations | journal = International Journal of Information Management | issn = 0268-4012 | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 102â116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes assumed that a [[joint venture]] between a government department and a commercial organization is an example of shared services. The joint venture involves the creation of a separate legal commercial entity (jointly owned), which provides profit to its shareholders.

Traditionally the development of a shared-service organization (SSO) or shared-service centre (SSC) within an organization is an attempt to reduce costs (often attempted through [[economies of scale]]), standardized processes (through centralization). A global Service Center Benchmark study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssonetwork.com/business-process-outsourcing/webinars/the-hackett-group-and-sson-service-center-benchmar/#.UdGPftfF8ms SSON and Hackett Group global Service Center Benchmark study | Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Network (SSON) | Webinar | 2009-03-31 | Presented by Penny Weller]&lt;/ref&gt; carried out by the Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Network (SSON) and the Hackett Group, which surveyed more than 250 companies, found that only about a third of all participants were able to generate cost savings of 20% or greater from their SSOs. At NASA, the 2006 switch to a shared services model is realizing nearly $20 million of savings annually. Further, by the end of 2015, the NASA Shared Services Center is expected to save the organization a total of over $200 million, according to NASAâs Director of Service Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Newton, âShared Services: Bringing Efficiency from NASA to Higher Education,â The EvoLLLution, October 17, 2014. Accessed at http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/shared-services-bringing-efficiency-nasa-higher-education/&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale cultural and process transformation can be a key component of a move to shared services and may include redundancies and changes of work practices. It is claimed that transformation often results in a better quality of work life for employees although there are few case studies to back this up {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}.

Shared services are more than just centralization or consolidation of similar activities in one location. Shared services can mean running these service activities like a business and delivering services to internal customers at a cost, quality, and timeliness that is competitive with alternatives.

== Critics of shared services ==

The management thinker and inventor of [[The Vanguard Method]], Professor [[John Seddon]] claims that shared service projects based on attempts to achieve '[[economies of scale]]' are a mix of the plausibly obvious and a little hard data, brought together to produce two broad assertions, for which there is little hard factual evidence.&lt;ref name="thesystemsthinkingreview18"/&gt; He argues that shared service projects fail (and often end up costing more than they hoped to save) because they cause a disruption to the service flow by moving the work to a central location, creating waste in handoffs, rework and duplication, lengthening the time it takes to deliver a service and consequently creating [[failure demand]] (demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for a customer).&lt;ref&gt;Systems Thinking in the Public Sector, John Seddon, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial structures ==

A shared service can take a variety of different commercial structures. The basic commercial structures include:

; Unitary: A single organization consolidating and centralizing a business service
: Lead department: An organization consolidating and centralizing a business service that will be shared by other organizations
; Joint initiatives: Agreement between two or more organizations to set up and operate shared services

== Location variations ==

It is sometimes argued that there are three basic location variations for a shared service including:

; On-shore: Work is carried out in the same country but at a different location
; [[Nearshoring|Near-shore]]: Work is carried out in a close location (e.g. continental Europe relative to the UK)
; [[Offshoring|Off-shore]]: Work is carried out anywhere in the world that is not on-shore or near-shore

This is not just to take advantage of wage arbitrage but to appreciate the talents of particular economies in delivering specific service offerings.

The difficulty with this argument is that near-shore and off-shore are normally associated with the [[outsourcing]] model and are difficult to reconcile with the notion of an internally shared service as distinct from an externally purchased service. Clearly, the use of off-shore facilities by a government department is not an example of shared services.

== Benchmarking and measurement ==

In establishing and running a shared service, [[benchmarking]] and [[measurement]] is considered by some as a necessity. Benchmarking is the comparison of the service provision usually against [[best in class]]. The measurement occurs by using agreed key performance indicators (KPIs). Although the amount of KPIs chosen differs greatly it is generally accepted that fewer than 10 carefully chosen KPIs will deliver the best results.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Organizations do attempt to define benchmarks for processes and business operations.

Benchmarking can be used to achieve different goals including:&lt;br&gt;
'''1.''' To drive performance improvements using benchmarks as a means for setting performance targets that are met either through incremental performance improvements or transformational change.&lt;br&gt;
-	Strategic: with a focus on a long term horizon; and &lt;br&gt;
-	Tactical: with a focus on the short and medium term

'''2.''' To focus an organization on becoming world class with processes that deliver the highest levels of performance that are better than those of its peer group.

== In the private sector ==

The [[private sector]] has been moving towards shared services since the beginning of the 1980s. Large organizations such as the [[BBC]], [[BP]], [[Bristol Myers Squibb]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[GE]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Pfizer]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], [[ArcelorMittal]], and [[SAP AG|SAP]] are operating them with great success. According to the English Institute of Chartered Accountants, more than 30% of U.S. Fortune 500 companies have implemented a shared-service center, and are reporting cost savings in their general accounting functions of up to 46%.

The conventional accounting practice used to generate these figures is disputed however by management thinker Professor [[John Seddon]], who argues that the measurement known as 'unit cost' tells you nothing about overall costs. Overall costs include '[[failure demand]]', which is defined as a failure to do something or do something right for the customer.

== In the public sector ==
The public sector has taken note of the benefits derived in the private sector and continues to strive for best practice. The United States and Australia among others have had shared services in government since the late 1990s. However, the failures of these projects are increasingly being reported by the press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com.au/article/392372/government_shared_services_navigate_rocky_road_-_part_1 Government shared services navigate a rocky road - Part 1 - shared services, government services division, queensland health].

=== UK ===
The UK government under a central drive to efficiency following from the [[Gershon Review]] are working to an overall plan for realizing the benefits of shared services. The [[Cabinet Office]] has established a team specifically tasked with the role of accelerating the take up and developing the strategy for all government departments to converge and consolidate. The savings potential of this transformation in the UK Public Sector was initially estimated by the [[Cabinet Office]] at Â£1.4bn per annum (20%  of the estimated cost of HR and Finance functions). The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]] in its November 2007 report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/07-08/07089.pdf NAO report (HC 2007-08): improving corporate functions using shared services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that this Â£1.4bn figure lacked a clear baseline of costs and contained several uncertainties, such as the initial expenditure required and the time frame for the savings.

There are reports of UK government shared service centres failing to realise savings, such as the Department of Transport's project, described as 'stupendous incompetence' by the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/systems-management/2008/12/16/mps-condemn-dft-shared-services-failure-39578367/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), has implemented shared services for a number of departments and functions. For example, IT Assist (the ICT Shared Service Centre) provides common infrastructure and desktop services to NICS staff in the office, at home or when mobile working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sogeti.ie/en/News--Events/Events/New-Webinar-Series--Software-Test-Leadership-/New-Webinar-Series-Business-Transformation/Public-Sector-Shared-Services/ Case study presentation on the IT Assist programme in Northern Ireland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511160218/http://www.sogeti.ie/en/News--Events/Events/New-Webinar-Series--Software-Test-Leadership-/New-Webinar-Series-Business-Transformation/Public-Sector-Shared-Services/ |date=2010-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

The government of Canada instituted Shared Services Canada on August 4, 2011, with the objective of consolidating its data centres, networks and email systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?nid=614499 Canada News Centre - Government of Canada to Reduce Information Technology Costs and Save Taxpayers' Dollars] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111170030/http://news.gc.ca/web/article-eng.do?nid=614499 |date=January 11, 2012 }}. News.gc.ca (2011-08-04). Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a tendency to centralize IT services that has been followed by the provinces of British Columbia, QuÃ©bec, and Ontario, as well as the federal government of the United States of America and some states like Texas. PriceWaterhouseCoopers recommended integrating government data centres in a report ordered by Public Works and Government Services Canada, revealed in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/comm/vedette-features/2011-12-02-00-eng.html PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study provides valuable insight into Government of Canada Data Centre Environment - Features - PWGSC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305035654/http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/comm/vedette-features/2011-12-02-00-eng.html |date=2012-03-05 }}. Tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the health service nationally has been reorganized from a set of regional Health Boards to a unified national structure, the Health Services Executive. Within this structure there will be a National Shared Services Organisation, based on the model developed at the former Eastern Health Shared Services, where procurement, HR, finance and ICT services were provided to health agencies in the Eastern Region of Ireland on a business-to business basis.

==New trends==

Organizations that have centralized their IT functions have now begun to take a close look at the technology services that their IT departments provide to internal customers, evaluating where it makes sense to provide specific technology components as a shared service.  E-mail and scanning operations were obvious early candidates; many organizations with document-intensive operations are deploying scanning centers as a shared service.

Many large organizations, in both the public and private sectors, are now considering deploying [[Enterprise Content Management|enterprise content management (ECM)]] technology as a shared service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2222">'''Sourcing advisory''' is the use of third-party (external entity) advice during the sourcing process. As such, it may refer to advice sought during [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]] or [[global sourcing]].

==Sourcing advisors==
Given the strategic nature of the advisory and the prevalence of [[Global sourcing|sourcing]] amongst global organizations, most [[management consulting]] firms today offer sourcing advisory services. In addition, there exist a host of specialized sourcing adivsory firms that focus on providing sourcing advisory and research inputs to the industry. Sourcing advisors can also be independent freelance consultants.

In recent years software tools to automate sourcing advisory emerged. Building on [[Software as a Service]] (SaaS), the trade mark "Sourcing Advisory as a Service" (SAaaS) is used in the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plixos.com/en/it-outsourcing-services/saaas-sourcing-advisory-as-a-service "SAaaS - Automation in Sourcing Advisory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==

'''The Partnership for Excellence''' (formerly the ''Ohio Partnership for Excellence'') is a [[nonprofit organization]] that administers a state-level award program for performance excellence in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. The award is based on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence], which are developed and maintained by the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/about/index.cfm Baldrige Performance Excellence Program], a program of the [https://www.nist.gov/index.html National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)].
__TOC__

==History==
The Ohio Partnership for Excellence was incorporated as a 501c(3) nonprofit organization in 1998 to provide state level Baldrige assessment services and resources for interested organizations. In 2011, it was renamed The Partnership for Excellence (TPE) to reflect regional expansion that includes the states of Indiana and West Virginia.&lt;ref name="regional expansion"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_07-28-11_Program_for_IN_&amp;_WV.htm Ohio Partnership for Excellence to Expand Programs to Indiana &amp; West Virginia], July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first award cycle was completed in 1999-2000.

In January 2008, Dr. Elaine D. Edgar was appointed to Executive Director.&lt;ref name="New Director 2008"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_01-01-08_new_director.htm Announcement of a new Executive Director for the Ohio Partnership for Excellence], January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After retirement from the role in March 2011, she was replaced by Colonel Alfred C. Faber, Jr. who was appointed to the position of President/CEO.&lt;ref name="New Director 2011"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_03-01-11_new_president-CEO.htm New OPE President / CEO Announced], March 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Baldrige Community==
*TPE is a member of the [http://www.baldrigepe.org/alliance/ Alliance for Performance Excellence] â a national network of state and local Baldrige-based awards programs.
*TPE Awards are based on the most recent Criteria for Performance Excellence â updated by the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program every two years.
*Starting in 2012, unless certain conditions are met, organizations from Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia are eligible to apply for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award only if they have been awarded TPE's ''Governor's Award of Excellence'' in the previous five years.&lt;ref name="New Eligibility Q&amp;A 2012"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Q-A_2012_Changes_to_Baldrige_Award_Eligibility.pdf Q&amp;A: 2012 Changes to Baldrige Award Eligibility], December 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eligibility Rules"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/award_application.cfm Baldrige Award Application Forms webpage], retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
TPE is a membership organization composed of interested individuals and organizations throughout Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. TPE collects annual membership dues for the January to December membership year.

==Board of Examiners==
TPE's Board of Examiners is composed of volunteer individuals who successfully complete annual training on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence]. Advisors and examiners used during the awards process are drawn from the Board of Examiners.

==Product/Service==
TPEâs main product is a feedback report to the partnering organizations that successfully complete the award process. The report contains strengths as well as opportunities for improvement (OFI) derived from both the submitted application and a site visit. This is a distinct difference from the national Baldrige Award process&lt;ref name="Baldrige Application Form"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Baldrige_Award_Application_Forms.pdf Baldrige Award Application Form], page 2&lt;/ref&gt; where only organizations with highly graded applications are granted a site visit.

TPE also provides Baldrige-related educational services such as conferences, seminars, and direct partnering with individuals and organizations.

==TPE Awards Process==
TPE provides three options for organizations wanting to improve their organizational performance:

===Advising===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to review the Criteria for Performance Excellence and assist in developing a 5-page Organizational Profile. After review of the organizational profile, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Spirit" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Partnering===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to develop a 25-page application addressing the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence at the "overall" level. After review of this application, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Pioneer" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Examining===
This is the traditional 50-page application assessment mirroring the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award's assessment cycle. Organizations participating in this option submit an ''Intent to Apply'' in October before the application due date in December each year. TPE assigns a team of 7 members from the Board of Examiners to review (independently and then by consensus) the application before a 3-day site visit is conducted. TPE then provides the organization with a list of strength and opportunities for improvement. Based on the recommendations of the examiners, TPE's Board of Trustees recognizes each organization with a Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum Award at the annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.
:*Platinum Level - Also called the ''Governor's Award for Excellence''
:*Gold Level - Also called the ''Achievement of Excellence'' Award
:*Silver Level - Also called the ''Commitment to Excellence'' Award
:*Bronze Level - Also called the ''Pledge to Excellence'' Award
:*In 2007, TPE also recognized two organizations with the ''Executive Director's Special Distinction'' award.

==Past ''Platinum Level - Governor's Award for Excellence'' Award Recipients==
Note:
*The Partnership for Excellence does not necessarily recognize an organization at the Platinum level every year. Awards may have been given at the Gold, Silver, or Bronze Levels only (not listed here).

'''UIBS''' (short for '''US India Business Summit''') is an annual Business Expo between the [[United States|U.S.]] and India that is best known for its  multidisciplinary speeches and panels, but is held only every other year.  It is devoted to what it calls "Friendship and Business between the United States and India".

The goal of UIBS is to promote business and investment between United States and India in key areas of technology, agriculture, healthcare, infrastructure, supply chain, logistics, real estate and investment etc. Our{{who|date=April 2015}} special emphasis is to connect entrepreneurs and small-to- medium size businesses.  UIBS 2010 is organized by the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] Center for International Business Education &amp; Research (CIBER), USA India Initiatives, Inc. (USIII) and US India Business and Research Center (USIBRC) with support of [[Georgia Department of Economic Development]], the [[Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce]], US Commercial Services, and the [[US Department of Commerce]].
