'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The website contains a database of meanings and expansions for [[abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s mainly in English but includes some entries in other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbis.uni-regensburg.de/dbinfo/detail.php?bib_id=ubos&amp;colors=&amp;ocolors=&amp;lett=fs&amp;tid=0&amp;titel_id=2223|title=Acronym Finder|date=|website=dbis.uni-regensburg.de|publisher=[[Universität Regensburg]]|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is freely accessible. The entries are further classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes which are shown on a Map along with location information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/blog/2017/04/03/e-tipp-der-woche-acronym-finder/|title=e-Tipp der Woche: Acronym Finder {{!}} [UB]log|website=blog.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations with multiple expansions are listed by popularity with the most common one being presented first, these can be sorted alphabetically as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/57676-acronym-finder|title=Acronym Finder - ExtremeTech|date=2001-09-05|work=ExtremeTech|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;GIRALDO ORTIZ, John Jairo.

Jul.-Dec. 2008, vol. 31, no. 2, p. 101-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone can contribute to the database by submitting abbreviations and their meanings, these are reviewed by an by [[editing|editor]] and categorized before being added to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; While the database has been described as fairly accurate errors have been found in the meanings and expansions of abbreviations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The website does not list sources for the abbreviations and their meanings but it does identify people who have contributed more than 50 abbreviations to the database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The database only contains abbreviations and their expansions and does not list other data such as grammatical category, context, source, field of the abbreviation etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Farlex, Inc. the current owner of the website also publishes mobile apps for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acronym-finder-acronyms-abbreviations-initialisms-more/id1032748692?mt=8|title=Acronym Finder - Acronyms, Abbreviations, Initialisms, and more on the App Store|website=App Store|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym Finder also includes a ''Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector'', a light-hearted tool that [[random]]ly generates jargon-like phrases and abbreviations — usually [[initialisms]] that would be unpronounceable as [[acronyms]] — and meanings from 30 cleverly chosen buzz words.

The website is supported through advertisements.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

==Reputation==
The website is listed as a quick reference tool in directories like Stanford Library, Library of Congress, USC Library.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556 &lt;nowiki&gt;Acronym finder [digital] : AF&lt;/nowiki&gt;]". ''searchworks.stanford.edu''. Stanford Libraries SearchWorks

Listings of abbreviations on the website have also been used as a defense that an abbreviation is in public use and cannot be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States Patents Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrdCAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Bureau of National Affairs|page=1283}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in some trademark cases citations for AF have been accepted it has been described as an unreliable reference in others.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|title=CTM upheld after medical trade mark declared not to be descriptive|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2011|website=oami.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134443/http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/OHIM/OHIMPublications/newsletter/1109/CTM/ctm1.en.do|archive-date=November 23, 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has garnered criticism for the fact that anyone can submit abbreviations to the site and the content is user generated. Mike Molloy the site's original owner had defended that each submission is verified before being added to the database.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

An '''autological word''' (also called '''homological word'''{{cn|date=April 2017}} or '''autonym'''{{cn|date=April 2017}}) is a word that expresses a property that it also possesses (e.g. the word "short" is short, "noun" is a noun, "English" is English, "[[wiktionary:pentasyllabic|pentasyllabic]]" has five syllables, "word" is a word). The opposite is a '''heterological''' word, one that does not apply to itself (e.g. "long" is not long, "monosyllabic" has five syllables).

Unlike more general concepts of autology and self-reference, this particular distinction and opposition of "autological" and "heterological words" is uncommon in [[linguistics]] for describing linguistic phenomena or classes of words, but is current in logic and philosophy where it was introduced by [[Kurt Grelling]] and [[Leonard Nelson]] for describing a semantic paradox, later known as Grelling's paradox or the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Grelling and Nelson used the following definition when first publishing their paradox in 1908: "Let ''&lt;big&gt;φ&lt;/big&gt;(M)'' be the word that denotes the concept defining ''M''. This word is either an element of ''M'' or not. In the first case we will call it 'autological', in the second 'heterological'." (Peckhaus 1995, p. 269). An earlier version of Grelling's paradox had been presented by Nelson in a letter to [[Gerhard Hessenberg]] on 28 May 1907, where "heterological" is not yet used and "autological words" are defined as "words that fall under the concepts denoted by them" (Peckhaus 1995, p. 277)&lt;/ref&gt; 

One source of autological words is [[ostensive definition]]: the reference to a class of words by an example of the member of the class, as it were by [[synecdoche]]: such as [[mondegreen]], [[oxymoron]], [[eggcorn]], [[bahuvrihi]], etc.
A word's status as autological may change over time. For example, ''[[neologism]]'' was once an autological word but no longer is; similarly, ''[[wikt:protologism|protologism]]'' (a word invented recently by literary theorist [[Mikhail Epstein]]) may or may not lose its autological status depending on whether or not it gains wider usage.

'''BRD''' ({{lang-de|'''&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;undes&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;epublik &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;eutschland'''}}; English: Federal Republic of Germany); ({{Audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is an unofficial abbreviation commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|communist regime]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) to refer to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], informally known at the time as [[West Germany]]. The East German regime previously used the term "[[German Federal Republic]]" to refer to its western counterpart.

Unlike the [[English language|English]] equivalent '''FRG''', which was used as an [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country code]] and a [[List of FIFA country codes|FIFA trigramme]], the use of ''BRD'' was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory [[communist]] term.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40606777.html Wer BRD sagt, richtet Unheil an], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 25 September 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTThlFv55ksC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=R4upIEECw6&amp;dq=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;f=true ''Dialectics, Dogmas, and Dissent: Stories from East German Victims of Human Rights Abuse''], John Rodden, Penn State Press, 2010, page xi&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany.&lt;ref name="schulrecht"&gt;[http://www.schulrecht-sh.de/texte/b/brd.htm Erlass der Schulbehörde Schleswig-Holstein], RdErl. vom 4. Oktober 1976 (NBl. KM. Schl.-H. S. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; After [[German reunification]], the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (''{{lang|de|Deutschland}}''), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany was its [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "DE", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.

==History==
[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Allied occupation zones in post-war Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), French (blue)]]

===Background===
The official name was and is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' ("Federal Republic of Germany"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' ("Germany"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''Länder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Württemberg-Baden]], and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|"new states"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.

Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=duden+brd+1967&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or "West Germany" (abbreviated "WD") for the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;dq=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600&lt;/ref&gt; but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or "German Federal Republic" (abbreviated "DBR"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name "Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen für die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in East Germany===
This changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name ''BRD'' was introduced as a [[propaganda]] counter-term to the term ''DDR'', trying to express the equality of the states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Deutschland%20%E2%80%93%20ein%20Name%20im%20Wandel.%20Die%20deutsche%20Frage%20im%20Spiegel%20der%20Sprache&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=BRD&amp;f=false ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the West would speak of the ''sogenannte DDR'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html Vom Sogenannten], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 21 October 1968, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; or "so-called 'DDR'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;dq=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-M_NkMnKAhXEPxoKHUj4BrIQ6AEIIDAA ''Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany''], 1959 - Germany (West), page 20&lt;/ref&gt; when it had to be belittled.

At that time, the initialism ''BRD'' had been adopted by ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]'s daily newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nd-archiv.de/ausgabe/1970-12-08 ''Neues Deutschland'', 8 December 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms ''Deutschland'' ("Germany") and ''deutsch'' ("German") in a number of terms, for example:
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L0827-207, München, XX. Olympiade, Eröffnungsfeier, DDR-Mannschaft.jpg|thumb|East German team at the opening ceremony of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]]]

* The state television service, [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] became "Fernsehen der DDR" in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2QpDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Fernsehen+der+DDR%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Fernsehen+der+DDR%22+1972 ''Hörfunk und Fernsehen in der DDR: Funktion, Struktur u.

* The [[North German Plain]], covering the north of East and West Germany, appeared in East German atlases as ''Nördliches Tiefland der DDR'' (Northern Plain of the GDR).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-X1OAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=N%C3%B6rdliches+Tiefland+ddr&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=N%C3%B6rdliches+Tiefland++ ''Muttersprache''], 1989, page 158&lt;/ref&gt;
* The GDR sent a separate team to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], at which its flag and anthem were used for the first time&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;ots=qmwb3hyF94&amp;dq=The%20GDR%20sent%20a%20separate%20team%20to%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics%2C%20at%20which%20its%20flag%20and%20anthem%20were%20used%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20GDR%20sent%20a%20separate%20team%20to%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics,%20at%20which%20its%20flag%20and%20anthem%20were%20used%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;f=true ''Sport, Politics, and Communism''], James Riordan, Manchester University Press, 1991, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1959, the GDR had used an identical flag to that of the Federal Republic, before adopting a version with the [[National Emblem of East Germany|national emblem]] in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXGTIu5jJDEC&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=east%20germany%20emblem%201959&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20germany%20emblem%201959&amp;f=true ''Germany from Partition to Reunification''], Henry Ashby Turner, Yale University Press, 1992, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ruling party's full name, ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or "Socialist Unity Party of Germany" remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' ("New Germany") .

[[File:DDR_international_vehicle_registration_oval.svg|thumb|upright|DDR international vehicle registration oval, used between 1974 and 1990.]]
Therefore,  using the abbreviation ''BRD'' fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|vehicle registration code]] ''D'', hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for ''DDR'' and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41667247.html Kennzeichen BÄÄH], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 12 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was rejected by the West, where some motorists  displayed bumper stickers with the slogan ''BRD - Nein Danke!'' ("BRD? No Thanks!").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkI3mUhsrDQC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;ots=l0RQx0j75Q&amp;dq=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;f=false ''Kontroverse Begriffe: Geschichte des öffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Georg Stötzel, Martin Wengeler
Walter de Gruyter, 1995, page 320&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;
 
As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' ("Federal Republic", or "Federal Territory") to refer to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' ("Federal Citizen[s]") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective ''bundesdeutsch'' ([[Federal Germans|federally German]]).

===Opposition to use in West Germany===
To distance themselves from the term ''BRD'', until [[German reunification]], the [[Cabinet of Germany|government of the Federal Republic of Germany]] and media sometimes used the abbreviations ''BR Deutschland,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7SQun-nAqJAC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=BR%20Deutschland&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q=BR%20Deutschland&amp;f=false ''Konfession und Wahlverhalten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Karl Schmitt, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1989, page 307&lt;/ref&gt; ''BR-Dt.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJeAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22BR+Dt.%22+deutschland&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22BR+Dt.%22+ ''Deutschland-Jahrbuch, Volume 2''], Klaus Mehnert, Heinrich Schulte

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004665-0003, Walter Hallstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Walter Hallstein]]
West Germany had always claimed to be ''the'' Germany, and did not like the comparison to ''DDR'', or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after [[Walter Hallstein]], State secretary at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1989/sep/15/berlinwall.germany The Two Germanies: Rivals struggle for Germany's soul - As worries surface in Bonn about the influx from the East, there are anxieties across Europe about the likely economic and international effects], ''[[The Guardian]]', 15 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an [[exclusive mandate]] over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established ''de facto'' diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] in 1972, [[Bonn]] and [[East Berlin]] exchanged "permanent missions",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/.../Start/Index/id/652004 History of the Berlin Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by "permanent representatives",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0908/090859.html East-West German trade up 8 percent] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 8 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''de jure'' embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations]], to which the East German mission was accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFK7RkdQG14C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Ministry+of+Intra-German+Relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TeP4ln6BSF&amp;sig=kapXyUfDiTZORzMuCqPzs9Rzm10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWtKGmxMvKAhUDwxQKHWR-AewQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=true ''Germany Divided: From the Wall to Reunification''], A. James McAdams
Princeton University Press, 1994, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;ots=CdUG2w_KQz&amp;dq=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=false ''Detente in Europe: Real or Imaginary?''], Josef Korbel, Princeton University Press, 2015, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending that the use of ''BRD'' be avoided.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] agreed not to use the initialism.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, "Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»", in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.)], No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of [[Bavaria]], forbidden it.&lt;ref name="preute"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9KEttd2OaPAC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;f=false ''Rechts um--zum Abitur: der geistige Wandel an deutschen Oberschulen''], Michael Preute
Ch. Links Verlag, 1995, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be ''nicht wünschenswert'' or "undesirable".&lt;ref name="schulrecht" /&gt; The [[Kultusministerkonferenz|conference of all the states ministers for school education]] decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; with pupils being required to write ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' in full and use of the term being deemed an error.&lt;ref name="preute" /&gt; The different usages were so ingrained that one could [[Shibboleth|deduce]] a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4QnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brd+imperialismus&amp;dq=brd+imperialismus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt_7HTuMnKAhWKXRQKHdw9De4Q6AEIKjAB ''Kampf dem BRD-Imperialismus''], Liga gegen den Imperialismus, 1972, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

==Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany==
[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|thumb|Map of divided Berlin, indicating by the broken line at Berlin's western border the territorial redeployment decided by the Allies.]]
A similar ideological question was the question whether to use "Berlin (West)" (the officially preferred name) or "West Berlin", and even whether to write "West Berlin" in [[German language|German]] as two hyphenated words - ''West-Berlin'' - or as one word - ''Westberlin''.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7kGqJGbaI4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Berlin+(West)%22+westberlin+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic28LjsMbKAhVFvRoKHRFoCQwQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Berlin%20(West)%22%20westberlin%20name&amp;f=true ''Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police''], Andreas Glaeser
University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Westerners called the [[West Berlin|Western sectors]] "Berlin", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin ''Groß-Berlin'' or "Greater Berlin",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Article 127 [Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}
Within one year after promulgation of this Basic Law the Federal Government, with the consent of the governments of the Länder concerned, may extend to the Länder of Baden, Greater Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and Württemberg Hohenzollern any law of the Administration of the Combined Economic Area, insofar as it remains in force as federal law under Article 124 or 125.]&lt;/ref&gt; but changed this "Berlin (West)", although it also used the hyphenated "West-Berlin". However, the East German government commonly referred to it as "Westberlin".&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term ''Democratic Berlin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;pg=PA344#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Berlin", by East Germany, and "Berlin (Ost)" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included ''Ost-Berlin'' and ''Ostberlin'' (both meaning "East Berlin") as well as ''Ostsektor'' or "Eastern Sector".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FMmOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;dq=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif8MfN8sjKAhVJPRQKHXPQA_EQ6AEI3AEwGw ''Der Rechtsstatus des Landes Berlin''], Ernst Renatus Zivier, Berlin Verlag, 1974, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' using "Ost-Berlin" and the centre-left ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' using "Ostberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ost+Berlin%22,+%22Ostberlin%22,+or+%22Ostsektor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dUlLgVcMcg&amp;sig=yg5HL2-Z23u3emp_z7D_ikH9sc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoo6r-yrbKAhWGwxQKHeiNBxIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ost%20Berlin%22%2C%20%22Ostberlin%22%2C%20or%20%22Ostsektor%22&amp;f=true ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names [[Middle Germany|''Mitteldeutschland'' ("Middle Germany")]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv_GCXcA8IYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;ots=H0OlpCONF6&amp;dq=%22BRd%22%20mitteldeutschland&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=mitteldeutschland&amp;f=false ''Die Agrarpolitik in Mitteldeutschland: und ihre Auswirkung auf Produktion und Verbrauch landwirtschaftlicher Erzeugnisse''], Edgar Tümmler, Konrad Merkel, Georg Blohm, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone)]] abbreviated as ''SBZ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8uGOqBCek8C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=sbz%20deutschland&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=sbz%20deutschland&amp;f=true ''Das Widerstandsrecht: Entwickelt anhand d. höchstrichterl.

Rechtsprechung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Günther Scheidle Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; This only changed under [[Willy Brandt]] when West German authorities started using the official name, ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' or ''DDR'', but many conservative German newspapers, like ''[[Bild]]'', owned by the [[Axel Springer AG|Springer]] company, always wrote ''"DDR"'' in [[scare quotes]]&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; until 1 August 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/welt_print/politik/article4235636/Als-aus-der-DDR-die-DDR-wurde.html "Als aus der ''DDR'' die DDR wurde: Der Verzicht auf die Gänsefüßchen kam in der WELT zur rechten Zeit"], Heiner Bröckermann and Sven Felix Kellerhoff, ''[[Die Welt]]'', 1.

In 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent [[Slovakia]], as Germany objected to the use of the [[Slovak language]] name ''Nemecká spolková republika'' (literally  "German Federal Republic") owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of ''Spolková republika Nemecko''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_20393-544-2-30.pdf?100831124854 Proven Partnerships with Development Potential: Germany’s relations with the Czech Republic and Slovakia], Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung, September 2010, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost identical to the equivalent ''Spolková republika Německo'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], a language closely related to Slovak,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/encyklopedie_statu/evropa/nemecko/ Německo], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt; but the Slovak authorities claimed that "Federal Republic of Germany" could not be translated grammatically into Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/semantic-spat-pits-german-against-slovak/336090.html Semantic Spat Pits German Against Slovak], ''[[Moscow Times]]'', Tony Barber, 10 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Government of Slovakia|Slovak government]] had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper ''Narodna Obroda'' that they were using "German Federal Republic" to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/name-calling-upsets-the-federal-republic-1594837.html Name-calling upsets the Federal Republic], ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''circular reference''' is a series of [[reference]]s where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
[[File:Circular Reference.svg|thumb|Circular reference (in red)]]

==In language==
A circular reference is not to be confused with the logical fallacy of a [[circular argument]].  Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use.  Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference.  Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;

:''Her brother gave her a kitten; his sister thanked him for it.''

is circular but not without meaning.  Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's [[Law of non-contradiction]], a fundamental philosophical [[axiom]].  In this view, without self-reference, [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry A. Osborn]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvJTwwCSy8UC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''The future of foreign language education in the United States''], pp.31-33, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-89789-719-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiengo&gt;Robert Fiengo, Robert May, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V77kaAVpU0UC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''Indices and identity''], pp.59-62, MIT Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-262-56076-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer programming==
{{For|circular references between objects or resources|Reference counting}}

Circular references can appear in [[computer programming]] when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Function A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called.  So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is.  Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever.  This leads to what is technically known as a [[livelock]].  It also appears in [[spreadsheet]]s when two cells require each other's result.  For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed.  (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference.  It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)

A circular reference represents a big problem in computing.

In ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html CREATE TABLE] for PostgreSQL and [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/clauses002.htm#i1015767 DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples] for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.

A distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output.  The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.&lt;ref name=Fiengo/&gt;

==In spreadsheets==
Circular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the [[Colebrook equation]] and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Solve Implicit Equations Inside Your Worksheet By Anilkumar M, Dr Sreenivasan E and Dr Raghunathan K |url=http://www.frpdesigns.com/iteration.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

== Styles ==
{{styles}}
{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science. A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1123–1127 |publisher= |location= |year=2006 |url= |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl189 |id= |pmid=16987841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J. Scott Armstrong |work=Interfaces |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=125–139 |date=2008 |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |location=Catonsville, Maryland |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/45579289_Verification_of_Citations_Fawlty_Towers_of_Knowledge/links/00b7d52b08d80022a0000000.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-17 |dead-url=no |format=PDF |doi=10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |issn=0092-2102 |eissn=1526-551X |jstor=25062982 |oclc=5582131729 |ssrn=1941335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fister Jr. | first1 = I. | last2 = Fister | first2 = I. | last3 = Perc | first3 = M.| doi = 10.3389/fphy.2016.00049 | title = Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels in Citation Networks | journal = Frontiers in Physics | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citation Network''' is a [[social network]] which contains paper sources and linked by co-citation relationships. Egghe &amp; Rousseau once (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;228) explain "when a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' cites a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can show this by an arrow going from the node representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the document representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this way the documents from a collection D form a directed graph, which is called a 'citation graph' or 'citation network' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/citation_network.htm Science Citation Index: Effectiveness in locating articles in the anaesthetics field: 'Perturbation of ion transport'. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 43: 814, Cawkell, A. E. (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==
[[Citation]] is a reference to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.
Citation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available. In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called "Research Reviews".&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/publications/papers/CMU-ECE-2011-017.pdf Structures and Statistics of Citation Networks, Miray Kas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and figures&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; ==
* Citation networks are directed. The links go from one document to the other. 
* Citation networks are acyclic because a paper can cite only existing papers.
* All edges in the citation networks point backwards in time.
* Links in co-authorship networks are reciprocal (symmetric).
* The link weights between two authors in co-authorship networks can increase over time if they have further collaboration.
* Vertices and edges added to the citation/co-authorship networks are permanent and cannot be removed at a later time. 
* The already formed part of the network is mostly static and only the leading edge of the network changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] used in languages such as [[Mari language|Mari]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]] to mark a likeness to something. 

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].

In Mari, the comparative case is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. Then, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case. Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.

In Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''. For example, ''sha'' is 'ice', ''shiila'' is 'cold', and ''shal shiila'' is 'cold as ice'.

'''Comparative cultural studies''' is a contextual approach to the study of culture in a global and intercultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=October 32, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is placed on the theory, method, and application of the study process(es) rather than on the "what" of the object(s) of study.

==Overview==
In comparative cultural studies, selected tenets of [[comparative literature]] are merged with selected tenets of the field of [[cultural studies]] (including [[cultural theory|culture theories]], (radical) [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], [[communication]] theories, and [[systems theories]]) with the objective to study culture and culture products (including but not restricted to literature, communication, media, art, etc.). This is performed in a contextual and relational construction and with a plurality of methods and approaches, interdisciplinary, and, if and when required, including teamwork. In comparative cultural studies, it is the processes of communicative action(s) in culture and the how of these processes that constitute the main objectives of research and study. However, scholarship in comparative cultural studies does not exclude [[textual analysis]] proper of other established fields of study. In comparative cultural studies, ideally, the framework of and methodologies available in the systemic and empirical study of culture are favored. Scholarship in comparative cultural studies includes the theoretical, as well as methodological and applied postulate to move and to dialogue between cultures, languages, literature, and disciplines: attention to other cultures against essentialist notions and practices and beyond the paradigm of the nation-state is a basic and founding element of the framework and its application.

'''Comparison''' is a feature in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] or [[syntax (linguistics)|syntax]] of some [[language]]s, whereby [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The [[comparative]] expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the '''superlative''' is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.

The [[grammatical category]] associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is '''degree of comparison'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoffrey|year=2002|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|pages=1099–1170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual degrees of comparison are the ''positive'', which simply denotes a property (as with the [[English grammar|English]] words ''big'' and ''fully'');  the ''comparative'', which indicates ''great'''er''''' degree (as ''bigger'' and ''more fully''); and the ''superlative'', which indicates ''great'''est''''' degree (as ''biggest'' and ''most fully'').&lt;ref&gt;Tom McArthur, ed. (1992) ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called [[Elative (gradation)|elative]] in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. ''beautiful'', ''less beautiful'', ''least beautiful''.

The comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the ''-er'' suffix or modifying word ''more'' or ''less'' (e.g., ''fast&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;'', ''&lt;u&gt;more&lt;/u&gt; intelligent'', ''&lt;u&gt;less&lt;/u&gt; wasteful''); it can also, however, appear  when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., ''more men than women''). One [[preposition]], ''near'', also has a superlative form, as in ''Find the restaurant nearest your house''.

==Formation of comparatives and superlatives==
Comparatives and superlatives may be formed [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], by inflection, as with the English and [[German grammar|German]] ''-er'' and ''-(e)st'' forms, or [[syntax|syntactically]], as with the English ''more...'' and ''most...'' and the [[French grammar|French]] ''plus...'' and ''le plus...'' forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as ''better'' and ''best'' (from ''good'') and ''less'' and ''least'' (from ''little/few'') in English, and ''meilleur'' (from ''bon'') and ''mieux'' (from the adverb ''bien'') in French.

==Comparative and superlative constructions==
Most if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.

Comparatives are often used with a [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with ''than'' in English, ''als'' in German, etc. In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and Greek ([[Ancient Greek grammar|Ancient]], [[Koine Greek grammar|Koine]] and [[Modern Greek grammar|Modern]]) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the [[genitive]] case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in "the best swimmer out of all the girls".

Languages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include "as... as" and "less/least...".

А few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], where expressions like "по&amp;#x300; човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)" (literally ''more person'', ''most person'', ''less person'' but normally ''better kind of a person'', ''best kind of person'', ''not that good kind of a person'') and "по&amp;#x300; обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)" (''I like more'', ''I like the least'') are quite usual.&lt;ref&gt;Comparatives in Bulgarian are formed with the particles по and най, separated with the following adjective or adverb with a hyphen. If they are applied to a noun or a verb, they are written as separate words with a grave accent over по ''po''. Comparatives in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] are formed identically but written as one word, Macedonian) (both meaning ''better'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage when considering only two things==

In many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, "May the better man win" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form "May the best man win" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl /&gt;

==Rhetorical use of unbalanced comparatives==

In some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common [[rhetorical]] device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes [[Linguistic prescription|considered ungrammatical]].&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/comparatives-versus-superlatives.aspx |title=Comparatives Versus Superlatives |first=Bonnie |last=Trenga |date=12 August 2008 |work=Grammar Girl |publisher=Quick and Dirty Tips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Always!
* Why pay more?
* We work harder.
* We sell for less!
* More doctors recommend it.

==English==
English has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs "more" and "most".

As a general rule, words with one [[syllable]] require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require "more" or "most", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, ''e.g.'' 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/papers/kytorom.html |title=Competing forms of adjective comparison in modern English: What could be more quicker and easier and more effective? |first1=Merja |last1=Kytö |first2=Suzanne |last2=Romaine |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological comparison===

Morphological comparison uses the [[suffix]]es ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"). These inflections are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin and are [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] suffixes -''ior'' and -''issimus'' and Ancient Greek -''īōn'' and -''istos''. They are typically added to shorter words, words of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these [[inflection]]s have fewer than three syllables.

This system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like "good", "better", and "best", contain [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms. These irregular forms include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| good || rowspan="2" | better || rowspan="2" | best
|-
| well
|-
| bad, evil || rowspan="2" | worse || rowspan="2" | worst
|-
| ill
|-
| rowspan="2" | far || farther || farthest
|-
| further || furthest
|-
| little || less(er) || least
|-
| many, much || more || most
|}

===Syntactic comparison===
The second system of comparison in English appends the [[grammatical particle]]s "more" and "most", themselves the irregular comparatives of "many" and  "much", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the [[diminutive]]s "less" and "least".

This system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than ''-ly'' (e.g., "beautiful"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| beautiful || more beautiful || most beautiful
|}

===Absolute adjectives===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}

Some adjectives, the [[ungradable adjective|absolute or ungradable adjectives]] do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either ''present'' or ''absent'', such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything "very Cretaceous", or to characterize something as "more igneous" than something else.

Some grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as ''full'', ''complete'', ''unique'', or ''empty'', which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.

Many [[prescriptive grammar]]s and [[English usage|style guides]] include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as ''more perfect'', ''most unique'', and ''most parallel'' as illogical [[pleonasm]]s: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be "very unique", or "more unique" than something else.

Other style guides argue that terms like ''perfect'' and ''parallel'' never apply ''exactly'' to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean ''nearly perfect'', ''nearly parallel'', and so on; in this sense, ''more perfect'' (''i.e.'', more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and ''more parallel'' (''i.e.'', more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.

==Balto-Slavic languages==
In most [[Balto-Slavic languages]] (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics ''по-'' (''more'') and ''най-'' (''most''):
:''голям'' (''big'')
:''по-голям'' (''bigger'')
:''най-голям'' (''biggest'')

In [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovene]], comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).
:''mladý'' / ''młody'' / ''mladý'' / '' mlad'' (''young'')
:''mladší'' / ''młodszy'' / ''mladší'' / '' mlajši'' (''younger'')
:''nejmladší'' / ''najmłodszy'' / ''najmladší'' / '' najmlajši '' (''youngest'')

In [[Russian language|Russian]], comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:
:''добрый'' (''kind'')
:''добрее'' (''kinder'')
:''добрейший'' (''kindest'')

==Romance languages==
In contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. "the most beautiful") and absolute (e.g. "very beautiful").

[[French language|French]]: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (''mon'', ''ton'', ''son'', etc.), before "plus" or "moins" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: ''Elle est la plus belle femme'' → (she is the most beautiful woman); ''Cette ville est la moins chère de France'' → (this town is the least expensive in France); ''C'est sa plus belle robe'' → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix "-issime" but only with certain words, for example: "C'est un homme richissime" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] distinguish comparative superlative ''(superlativo relativo)'' and absolute superlative ''(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).
For the comparative superlative they use the words "mais" and "più" between the article and the adjective, like "most" in English.
For the absolute superlative they either use "muito"/"molto" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding ''issimo'' (singular masculine), ''issima'' (singular feminine), ''íssimos''/''issimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íssimas''/''issime'' (plural feminine). For example:
*''Aquele avião é velocíssimo''/''Quell'aeroplano è velocissimo'' → That airplane is very fast
There are some irregular forms for some words ending in "-re" and "-le" (deriving from Latin words ending in "-er" and "-ilis") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending "-re" and they gain the endings ''errimo'' (singular masculine), ''errima'' (singular feminine), ''érrimos''/''errimi'' (plural masculine), or ''érrimas''/''errime'' (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the "-l"/"-le" ending and gain ''ílimo''/''illimo'' (singular masculine), ''ílima''/''illima'' (singular feminine), ''ílimos''/''illimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íli
[[Romanian language|Romanian]], similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word "mai" before the adjective, which operates like "more" or "-er" in English. For example: ''luminos'' → bright, ''mai luminos'' → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word "puțin" (little) is added between "mai" and the adjective, for example ''mai puțin luminos'' → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant "cel" precedes "mai," conjugated as "cel / cei" for male singular / plural and "cea / cele" for female singular / plural. For example: ''cea mai luminoasă stea'' → the brightest star; ''cele mai frumoase fete'' → the most beautiful girls; ''cel mai mic morcov'' → the smallest carrot.

==Celtic languages==
[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an ''e'' to the end and ''i'' before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by "nas" to say "more," and ''as'' to say "most." (The word ''na'' is used to mean ''than''.) Adjectives that begin with ''f'' are lenited.  and ''as'' use different syntax constructions. For example:
Tha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I am taller than my sisters.
Is mi as àirde.'' → I am the tallest.

As in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.

In other tenses, ''nas'' is replaced by ''na bu'' and ''as'' by ''a bu,'' both of which [[Lenition|lenite]] the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an ''f'' followed by a vowel, the word ''bu'' is reduced to ''b'''. For example:

*''Bha mi na b' àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I was taller than my sisters.
*''B' e mi a b' àirde.'' → I was the tallest.

[[Welsh Language|Welsh]] is similar to English in many respects.  The ending ''-af'' is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English ''-est'', and with (most) long words ''mwyaf'' precedes it, as in the English ''most''.  Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular.  Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative ''must'' be used, e.g. of two people - ''John ydy'r talaf'' (John is the tallest).

==Akkadian==
[[Image:AmarnaLetterOfMarriageNegotiation-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|right|240px|thumb|[[Amarna letter EA 19]], Para 2, (last line): "...the Gods and (our Kingly relations), forever"..."''may it be'', (one verb, (5 signs, e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi)), ''I-n-t-e-r-R-e-l-a-t-e-d''-!." &lt;br&gt;(The first sign "e" is rubbed off; only a space-(depression) locates it.)-(high resolution expandible photo)]]
In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]], (on a 12 paragraph [[clay tablet]]), from the [[time period]] of the 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]] (a roughly 20-year [[text corpus|body]] of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral "10," as well as "7 and 7." The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.

The term [[Amarna letters-phrases and quotations#7 times and 7 times again|"7 and 7"]] means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds "more" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, ''Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):'' ''"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times'' '''''more,''''' ''...."''.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{citation
|last = Moran
|first = William L.
|authorlink=William L. Moran
|origyear = 1987|year = 1992
|title = The Amarna Letters
|url = https://www.amazon.com/Amarna-Letters-William-L-Moran/dp/0801867150#reader_0801867150

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323–324}} The word 'more' is Akkadian ''mila'', and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is "...over and over again, overflowing," (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).

The numeral 10 is used for ''ten times greater'' in EA 19, ''Love and Gold'', one of King [[Tushratta]]'s eleven letters to the Pharaoh-([[Amenhotep IV]]-''[[Akhenaton]]''). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):

:''".... Now, in keeping with our constant and mutual love, you have made it'' '''10''' ''times greater than the love shown my father. May the gods grant it, and may [[Teshub|Teššup]], my lord, and [[Amun|Aman]] make'' flourish ''for evermore, just as it is now, this mutual love of ours.''&lt;ref name="Moran" /&gt;{{rp|42–46}}

The actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, ''to light up, to rise''), uses: -e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: ''"...may it be, flourish-our (relations)."''

==Estonian==
In Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with ''kõige'' followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of ''sinine'' 'blue' is ''sinisem'' and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is ''kõige sinisem''. There is also a synthetic ("short") superlative form, which is formed by adding ''-m'' to the end of the plural partitive case. For ''sinine'' the plural partitive form is ''siniseid'' and so ''siniseim'' is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the ''kõige''-form, has a lot of exceptions.

A number of authors have carried out comparisons of [[Nazism]] and [[Stalinism]], in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and [[political systems]], what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of [[Stalinism]] and [[Nazism]] was made on the topics of [[totalitarianism]], ideology, and [[personality cult]]. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two.&lt;ref name="Geyer2"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political scientist]]s [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Carl Friedrich]] and historian [[Robert Conquest]] were prominent advocates of applying the "totalitarian" concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Geyer, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The various authors are listed in chronological order, by the date of publication of the earliest work cited in their section. --&gt;
== Hannah Arendt==
[[File:Hannah arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hannah Arendt]] was one of the first scholars to propose that the regimes of Hitler and Stalin could be grouped in the same political category.]]
===The origins of totalitarianism===
One of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union was [[Hannah Arendt]]. In her 1951 work, ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Arendt puts forward the idea of [[totalitarianism]] as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which “differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt’s view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on [[antisemitism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European [[nation-state]]s and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an “inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason.

European [[New Imperialism|imperialism of the nineteenth century]] also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the “[[Pan-nationalism|pan-movements]]” of [[pan-Germanism]] and [[pan-Slavism]], which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arendt, “Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment, propaganda and indoctrination===
Arendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements “recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and who “had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted [[determinism|deterministic]] views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as “originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in “killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties” both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, “different from the ‘idle talkers’ of other parties.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt distinguishes these two categories as "indoctrination" and "propaganda". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,” while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on “the totalitarian governments’ isolation and security from outside interference.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of “scientific” truth, and appeals to “objective laws of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements took a [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern [[advertising]], in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of “that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; By their use of [[pseudoscience]] as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to [[religion]] or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German “[[herrenvolk|master race]],” despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin repeatedly [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purged the Communist Party]] of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of “dying classes” and their demise was historically inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leader===
Arendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a [[cult of personality]] develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "enemies"===
Once in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the [[Munich Agreement]], or when Stalin unleashed the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration camps===
Arendt points out the widespread use of [[concentration camp]]s by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore “more essential to the preservation of the regime’s power than any of its other institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: “The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of “open anti-utility,” by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower – during a war – for the purpose of building and staffing [[extermination camps]] and transporting people to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as [[slavery]].  Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime – not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

===The future of totalitarian systems===
Throughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented “an entirely new form of government” which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that “all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski ==

===Totalitarian systems and autocracies===
The totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that “totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of [[autocracy]], but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy and the [[People’s Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

Carl Friedrich noted that the “possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany” has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European [[absolute monarchy]] on certain levels.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as “the people”, “the masses” or “the Volk.” Thus the common feature of autocracies – whether monarchical or totalitarian – is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as “the oscillation between tight and loose control.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that “totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a “''novel'' type of autocracy”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for [[propaganda]], for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a [[secret police]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are “basically alike” but “not wholly alike” – they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek “the world revolution of the proletariat,” while fascists wish to “establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars of totalitarian systems===
In terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a [[one-party state|single political party]], composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, “a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat” in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, “a system of terroristic police control” that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Two first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin’s personality cult in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that “unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictator and his henchmen ====
The totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin’s entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator’s power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated “father of the people,” was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator’s inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin’s death led to a prolonged power struggle.

====Totalitarian Party====
Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[CPSU]] under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party’s ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political [[purge]]s of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the [[Great Purge]] or the [[Night of the Long Knives]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the [[Führer]] as one of its key ideological principles (the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin’s decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Each totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Stalinist collectivization of agriculture]] or the [[Final Solution |Nazi “final solution”]], cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a [[utopian]] commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy.  This stereotyped enemy could be described as “the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik” for the Nazis, or “the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter” for the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideology and symbolism====
According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the “[[Workers of the world, unite!|workers of the world]].” Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation – the “[[master race]]” that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, “in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is ''its'' essential condition, as seen by its ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism.

Friedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the [[hammer and sickle]], a newly-created symbol, “invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.” Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the [[swastika]], “a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda and terror====
Totalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one’s job, social stigma and defamation. “Terror” can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda – one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, paradoxically, a totalitarian government’s complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn’t.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler’s rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late (see: [[20 July plot]]). In 1948, during the early days of the [[Berlin Blockade]], the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of [[West Berlin]] was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the “ritualization of propaganda”: the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests, executions and concentration camps====
The totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps – also noted by Arendt – was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that “totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or “civil war” against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] that accompanied it. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 187, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot). &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. These ranged from [[labor camp]]s to [[extermination camp]]s, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to “eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; As the field of [[Holocaust studies]] was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving “extreme viciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; They also compare these camps with the Soviet [[Gulag]] system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw==
[[File:Ian Kershaw 2012 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Kershaw]] in 2012]]

===Germany and Russia===
The comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as [[Moshe Lewin]] and [[Ian Kershaw]] together with their collaborators. Writing after the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical “anomalies” – unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had “powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.” Both had “powerful landowning classes,” while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features.

===Similarities and differences of the systems===
Ian Kershaw  admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in “the nature and extent of their inhumanity,” but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspects&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a “totalitarian” category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality cult====
Lewin and Kershaw place the [[cult of personality]] at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes “represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult – the ‘heroic myth’ of the ‘great leader’, no longer a king or emperor but a ‘man of the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its “merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits” by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They compare this with the [[Prussia]]n military tradition in Germany, which had been called “bureaucratic absolutism” in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a “classic charismatic leadership movement,” defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, “Hitler ''was'' ideological orthodoxy” – Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the “Hitler myth” and the “Stalin myth,” and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the “Hitler myth” was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the “Stalin myth” was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin’s leadership within the Party. Stalin’s personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the “Hitler myth” was essential to Nazi Germany, the “Stalin myth” was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrinsic instability of totalitarian systems====
Together with fellow historian [[Hans Mommsen]], Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an “intrinsic structural contradiction” which led to “inherent self-destructiveness”: they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin’s Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime – such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort – were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[Führerprinzip]], all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the Führer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a “social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin’s regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stalin and Hitler====
Kershaw also saw  major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as “a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine” and a “creature of his party,” who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kershaw, “Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,” while Hitler “was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,” preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin’s personality cult was “superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,” and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, “the ‘Hitler myth’ was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its ''Weltanschauung''.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kershaw’s analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of “charismatic authority” as described by [[Max Weber]]. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not. &lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rousso, Werth, and Burrin ==
[[File:Nicolas Werth 04-2012.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Werth in 2012]]
The topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians [[Henry Rousso]], [[Nicolas Werth]] and Philippe Burrin.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The differences between Stalinism and Nazism===
Rousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as “totalitarian”) should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in “a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).” All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, “in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that “totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,” and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between the dictator and bureaucracy===
Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin’s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an “administrative system of command,” bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of “running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin’s accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin’s regime against its own party and state cadres.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the “Intentionalist” and “Functionalist” schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler’s autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the Führer.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party’s ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: “One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.” Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be “someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party’s entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power – as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler’s rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a “far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of terror and violence===
Another major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an “extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society” for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to “gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls “military-feudal exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the [[Gulag]], mass executions (especially during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937-38), and most of all the great famine of 1932-33, known as the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in [[Moscow Trials|show trials]]). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in [[Ukraine]]), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Werth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin’s former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as “[[Old Bolshevik]]s.” They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with “corrupt officials” that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old [[Tsarist]] tradition of blaming “bad bureaucrats” – rather than the [[Tsar]] – for unpopular government actions.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the [[Ukrainians]], the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the [[Volga Germans]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Chechens]] and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic [[Jews]], especially as [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic]] near the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin’s study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that “violence is at the heart of Nazism,” and that Nazi violence is “established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, “doctrine and reality were fused from the start.” Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking [[lebensraum|”living space”]] and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the Left in general and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 – most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and “asocials.” The “asocials” were only vaguely defined, and included “Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]]. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the “Aryan race” of “degenerate” elements and [[life unworthy of life]], as well as outward, to seek the extermination of [[Untermensch|“inferior races”]]. Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a “euthanasia” program called [[Aktion T4]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose – the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime – so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at “racially inferior” non-German populations. As laid out in ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the [[Jews]] of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the [[Holocaust]], the Nazi [[genocide]] of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geyer and Fitzpatrick ==
In ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', editors [[Michael Geyer]] and [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as “immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships” who “shook the world in their antagonism.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the “most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent” of the European dictatorships of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They are comparable because of their “shock and awe” and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that “when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both “ideology driven” and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a “short-lived, explosive nature.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an “entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,” even though they had different visions about what being a “New Man” would mean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopolitics, eugenics and social engineering===
Among the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss [[biopolitics]] and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] techniques to increase the number of births.&lt;ref name="Geyer9"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems—both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s legislation had created the world's first national public health care program.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"/&gt; The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Geyer11"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced [[eugenics]] at this time, and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different.&lt;ref name="Geyer6"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany’s policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR’s policies resembled those in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state — "part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society".&lt;ref name="Geyer7"&gt;[[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did—the Soviet government called eugenics a "fascist science"—although there were in fact Soviet eugenicists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/connections/54ece589642e09bce5000001|title=Russia (former USSR)|work=The Eugenics Archives|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor—Nazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.&lt;ref name="Geyer8"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass violence, xenophobia and persecution of ethnic minorities===
In another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="Geyer13"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and [[the Holocaust]] in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Geyer15"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 135, 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state – the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Geyer13" /&gt; They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on [[xenophobia]] – the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against "asocial" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against "anti-soviet", "[[counter-revolutionary]]" and "socially harmful" elements – a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities.&lt;ref name="Geyer14"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stalinist Soviet Union established "special settlements" where the "socially harmful" or "socially dangerous" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and "declassed elements" were expelled to.&lt;ref name="Geyer15a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; These "special settlements" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories.&lt;ref name="Geyer16"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5000 [[Romani people]] effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the "special settlements" in Western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Geyer16" /&gt; In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did [[forced labor]].&lt;ref name="Geyer17"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up “living space” for ethnic German settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the [[General Government]]. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement.&lt;ref name="Geyer17a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="Geyer18"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Soviet authorities claimed the territory was "rich soil for the Japanese to till" – implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a "Soviet xenophobia" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent [[Russian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt;

After Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people – over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community – were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations.&lt;ref name="Geyer19"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the [[Balkars]], [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Karachai]], and [[Kalmyks]]) that together numbered 900,000.&lt;ref name="Geyer20"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt;

Two ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture – such as accusing Chechens of being associated with “banditism” – and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to “remake” and “reform” these cultures.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen “bandits” that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Geyer21"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees – they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Geyer22"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.&lt;ref name="Geyer23"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other scholars==
&lt;!-- This section contains statements sourced to scholarly authors who have written on the topic of the comparison between Nazism and Stalinism, but for whom we only have a little information in the article at the moment, so it would not make sense to assign a separate section to each of them. As the material cited to a given author grows beyond two or three paragraphs, consider giving that author a dedicated section. --&gt;

Other historians and political scientists have also made comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism as part of their work.

[[Stanley Payne]], in his work on fascism, said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Payne|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=15 March 1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299080648|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both placed a major emphasis on creating a "party-army," with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the [[political commissar]]s, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for "National Socialist Guidance Officers" in 1943.&lt;ref name="Payne1"&gt;[[#Payne1983|Payne (1983)]]. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Furet]], in his work on communism, noted that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. Pp. 191-192"&gt;François Furet. ''Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century''. University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-27340-7}}. Pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] draws attention to [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin and his antisemitism]] in a parallel with [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi antisemitism]]. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section [[Yevsektsiya]], with a stated mission of “destruction of traditional Jewish life, the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, and Hebrew culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, the Bolsheviks  began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into "Communist centers, clubs or restaurants."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On August 12, 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]". Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the [[Doctors' plot]].

A number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the [[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]] in Germany, the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] in the Czech Republic and the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in Poland.

In comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, some historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. American historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]], for example, after assessing such data, says that while the Nazi regime killed approximately 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if "foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included"), Stalin's deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|website=The New York Review of Books|date=27 January 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/|accessdate=25 May 2018|quote=" The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . . . All in all, the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included. For the Soviets during the Stalin period, the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million. These figures are of course subject to revision, but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian historian and archival researcher [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] posits that "The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible." Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's "purposive killings" fit more closely into the category of "execution" than "murder", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf|title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|last=Wheatcroft|first=S.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the "double genocide thesis", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the "double genocide thesis", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: "1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust." By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could "threaten the primacy of private property and free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 115–142|title = A Tale of "Two Totalitarianisms": The Crisis of Capitalism and the Historical Memory of Communism| journal = History of the Present| date = 2014|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf | jstor = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115|authorlink=Kristen R.

The comparison of Stalinism and Nazism remains a neglected field of academic study.&lt;ref name="Geyer5"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In political discourse==

The comparison of Nazism and Stalinism has long provoked political controversy,&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian; Moshé Lewin"&gt;Kershaw pp3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleck&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleck |first=Christian|title=Intellectuals and their publics: perspectives from the social sciences|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7540-2|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it led to [[Historikerstreit|the historians' dispute]] within Germany in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lévy, Daniel. Sznaider, Natan"&gt;Lévy pp76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), under the leadership of Chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], adopted the view that "red equals brown", i.e. that the communists and Nazis posed an equal danger to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelheid von Saldern, ''The Challenge of Modernity: German Social and Cultural Studies, 1890-1960'', University of Michigan Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-472-10986-3}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Kurt Schumacher]] said that the two movements enabled each other. He argued that the [[Communist Party of Germany]], which was staunchly Stalinist, were "red-painted Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lasten diktatorischer Vergangenheit, Herausforderungen demokratischer Gegenwart |last=Richter |first=Michael |editor1-first=Gerhard |editor1-last=Besier |editor2-first=Katarzyna |editor2-last=Stoklosa |series=Mittel- und Ostmitteleuropastudien |year=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag |location=Münster |page=202 |chapter=Die doppelte Diktatur.

Marxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Dave Renton. ''Fascism: Theory and Practice''. London: Pluto Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Henry Rousso. "Stalinism and Nazism. History and Memory Compared". ''Historische Zeitschrift''. 286:3, 2008. Pp. 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]], initiated by the [[Czech government]] and signed by figures such as [[Václav Havel]], called for "a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes" and for

The 2008 documentary film ''[[The Soviet Story]]'', commissioned by the [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] group in the [[European Parliament]], published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to [[Gestapo]] or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Story'', Edvins Snore, writer/director, 85-minute documentary, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[European Union]] has officially commemorated the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]],&lt;ref name="Buzek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |title=President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf46Gk7v?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed by the [[European Parliament]] in 2008&lt;ref name="Buzek" /&gt; and endorsed by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8133749.stm|title=Resolution on Stalin riles Russia|date=3 July 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada).&lt;ref name="TorontoSun2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Victims of totalitarianism remembered |author= Daniel Proussalidis |url= http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/23/victims-of-totalitarianism-remembered |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[President of the European Parliament]] and [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] member, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], argued that "both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible."&lt;ref name="eurolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |title=Baltic States opened Western Europe's eyes on Soviet Union totalitarianism -- EP chairman in Vilnius |date=2009-04-28 |publisher=BNS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150204/http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] has argued that "there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard."&lt;ref name="romea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |title=Czech Foreign Minister: Denial of communist crimes like denial of Nazi crimes |publisher=Romea.cz |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf7qICc8?url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |archivedate=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU rejects eastern states' call to outlaw denial of crimes by communist regimes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazism|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2011|location=London|first=Leigh |last=Phillips|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are "blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/nuremberg-trials-ww2-russia/ |title=Russian MPs call on world to suppress attempts to revive Nazi ideology |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=2010-10-24|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Seumas Milne]] posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, "has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/sep/12/highereducation.historyandhistoryofart Seumas Milne: The battle for history].

''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' are American [[media franchise]]s which present alternative scenarios of space adventure. The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of [[intellectual property]], providing employment and [[entertainment]] for billions of people around the world.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=130035|title=Trekkers VS Lucasites|date=May 14, 1999|author=Richard Ho|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
''Star Trek'' was introduced as [[Star Trek: The Original Series|a live-action television series]] in 1966 that lasted three years. ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matt |last=Forbeck|title=Star Wars vs. Star Trek: Could the Empire kick the Federation's ass? And other galaxy-shaking enigmas|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=J1sSa6uBdlQC}}|date=18 April 2011|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-2577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the subsequent publication of novels, comics, animated series, toys and feature films, ''Star Trek'' grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/18/star-trek-vs-star-wars-the-space-battle-that-will-never-end/|title=Star Trek vs Star Wars: the space battle that will never end|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' was introduced as a feature film, ''[[A New Hope (film)|A New Hope]]'' (1977). A novelization titled ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'', based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, ''Star Wars'' quickly grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

==Differences==
''Star Trek'' debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]], but evolved into an idealistic, [[utopia]]n prospect of future human society. Inspired by ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'',&lt;ref name="Simon1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Keller Simon|title=Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOtvQHj1AdIC&amp;pg=PA139|date=23 November 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92442-0|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Clark|title=Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_lxVMh_5xwC&amp;pg=PT22|date=1 April 2012|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-55783-963-3|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek''{{'}}s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. ''Star Trek'' occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] and [[Multiverse|interdimensional travel]]. The [[Earth in science fiction|Earth of the ''Star Trek'']] universe shares most of its history with the real world.

''Star Wars'' debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. ''Star Wars'' mainly belongs to the [[space opera]] [[subgenre]] of science fiction that follows [[The Hero's Journey]]&lt;ref&gt;Clive Williams, The Hero’s Journey: A Mudmap for Change, Journal of Humanistic Psychology, (002216781770549), (2017).
Crossref&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]], [[King Arthur]]&lt;ref name=Dreams&gt;''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''. ''Star Wars'' Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucasfilm|title=Star Wars and History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=m81Bg4E_y_IC}}|date=15 October 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-28525-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. ''Star Wars'' is set "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", although many characters are human, occasionally use [[Earth]] metaphors and exhibit human character traits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. ''Star Wars'' has not produced any live-action television series while ''Star Trek'' has produced seven live-action television series.

''Star Trek'' likewise has not produced any [[television film]]s; whereas ''Star Wars'' has produced at least three live-action television films outside the ''Star Wars'' film saga. The ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', ''[[Ewoks: Caravan of Courage]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' are all live-action television spin-off films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe, but not considered part of the official ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars canon]]''.

===Runtime===
* ~513 hours (''Star Trek'' television) + ~25 hours (''Star Trek'' films)
* ~84 hours (''Star Wars'' films) + ''Star Wars'' canon series + expanded universe films and TV productions.

==Similarities and commonalities==
Aside from both having the word ''star'' in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the [[space western]] subgenre.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Both stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in ''Star Trek'' consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the [[United Federation of Planets]]. ''Star Wars'' depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and was again later reformed into a new society called the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] after a series of wars.

Both franchises promote philosophical and political messages.

The primary philosophies of ''Star Trek'' convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was inspired by [[morality play|morality tales]] such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="Simon1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"/&gt;

The primary philosophical messages of ''Star Wars'' are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another.&lt;ref name="Decker2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin S. |last=Decker|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pDMRdxLocsUC}}|date=1 October 2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4596-0101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' preaches against [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] systems and favors societies that offer equality.&lt;ref name="Redmond2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sean |last=Redmond|title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ha5O_0BCCrgC|page=303}}|year=2004|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-87-1|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on the ''Star Wars'' 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, [[Patrick Stewart]] stated "A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of ''Star Wars'' is a very very positive one."

There have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''Seaquest''.

Both franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]. Many planets and alien species in ''Star Trek'', for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various ''Star Trek'' television series, such as "[[Who Mourns for Adonais]]", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings.&lt;ref name="Kapell2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew Wilhelm |last=Kapell|title=Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hWS7v3pGynUC}}|date=1 March 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also make references to [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]] and its [[Babylonian religion|mythic folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksarchive.com/viewstory.php?sid=4899|title=Star Trek as Myth Through an Analysis of the Similarities and Differences Between the Gilgamesh/Enkidu and Kirk/Spock Relationships|publisher=The Kirk/Spock fanfiction archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Klingon]]s and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/startrek/startrek1.htm|title=Star Trek And the New Myth of the Machine as Seen in the Talosians, Trelane, and the Organians|work=Ken Sanes|publisher=Transperancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ''Star Wars''{{'}} story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including [[Classical antiquity|classical Greece and Rome]], such as the fall of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] in ''Star Wars'', followed by the rise of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which parallels the fall of the ancient [[Roman Republic]] followed by the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

A 1983 documentary on the making of ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' was hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.blastr.com/2014-2-20/leonard-nimoy-hosts-1983-return-jedi-set-visit-awesome-long-lost-clip|title=Leonard Nimoy hosts 1983 Return of the Jedi set visit in this awesome, long-lost clip|work=Trent Moore|publisher=SyFyWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abrams era ===
[[J. J. Abrams]], director and producer of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and producer of ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), directed and produced ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015). ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as [[Simon Pegg]] starred in both series.

''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) was poorly received and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.

The newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/star-wars-abu-dhabi-the-worthy-zinzana-rattle-the-cage-justice-1201677541/|title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens Helps Abu Dhabi Build Road To Somewhere - Deadline|author=Ali Jaafar|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scenes for cities in the film ''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/star-trek-beyond-descends-on-dubai-jlt-difc-raided-2015-10-13-1.606444|title='Star Trek Beyond' descends on Dubai: JLT, DIFC 'raided'|work=Emirates 24-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.

==Estimated financial comparisons==
Despite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the ''Star Wars'' film series exceed the profit of the ''Star Trek'' film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.

==Critique and commentaries==
Science fiction writer [[David Brin]] criticized ''Star Wars'' at the time of the release of ''The Phantom Menace'', arguing that while the ''Star Wars'' movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with ''Star Wars'' and George Lucas, whom he accused of "having an agenda", is that the ''Star Wars'' galaxy is too "elitist", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the [[Galactic Civil War]] as part of the "same genetically superior royal family".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/|title="Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists|first=David|last=Brin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds the ''Star Wars'' universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that [[Luke Skywalker]] killing [[Palpatine]] would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Among the many other flaws he sees with ''Star Wars'' is that [[Anakin Skywalker]] becomes a hero in the ending of ''Return of the Jedi'' simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, ''Star Trek'' is "democratic" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

[[William Shatner]] argues that ''Star Trek'' is superior to ''Star Wars''. According to him, "''Star Trek'' had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions."&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Shatner believes that ''Star Wars'' was only better than ''Star Trek'' in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, ''Star Trek'' was able to "supersede ''Star Wars'' on every level".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/william-shatner-star-trek-star-wars_n_964530.html|title=William Shatner: 'Star Wars Is Derivative Of Star Trek'|first1=Gazelle Emami Deputy Features|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=15 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Russ]], who played [[Tuvok]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that ''Star Trek'' reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. ''Star Wars'' in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the [[Eastern philosophy]] of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, ''Star Trek'' comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in "our" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas ''Star Wars'' takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] is best known for his role as [[Boba Fett]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. He is a huge fan of ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. He argued that while both franchises are popular, ''Star Wars'' comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

Contrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued, "''Trek'' fandom revolves around technology because the ''Star Trek'' universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ''Gong Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. [[Physics and Star Wars|The science in ''Star Wars'']] is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because ''Star Wars'' isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second [[Death Star]] works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/game-theory-star-wars-world-with-a-sense-of-humor.html|title='Star Wars' World With a Sense of Humor|date=29 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wenzel of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' highlighted two differences in approach, noting the "swashbuckling" and "gunslinger" style of ''Star Wars'' compared with ''Star Trek''{{'}}s "broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity" and that the spiritual aspect of ''Star Wars'' contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518101|title="Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek": The final frontier of marketing is an expanding universe|author=John Wenzel|date=11 October 2009|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire [[Peter Thiel]] told Dowd "I'm a capitalist. ''Star Wars'' is the capitalist show. ''Star Trek'' is the communist one". He further stated "There is no money in ''Star Trek'' because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of ''Star Wars'' starts with [[Han Solo]] having this debt that he owes and so the plot in ''Star Wars'' is driven by money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/peter-thiel-star-trek-communist-star-wars-capitalist/|title=Peter Thiel Thinks 'Star Trek' Is 'Communist' While 'Star Wars' Is 'Capitalist'|date=11 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archived footage in ''[[Trek Nation]]'' showed [[Gene Roddenberry]] saying, "I like ''Star Wars''. It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;[[Trek Nation]] [2010 documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on each other==
{{see also|Star Wars sources and analogues}} 
The two franchises have a "symbiotic relationship" stated Shatner, who credits ''Star Wars'' for launching the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]].&lt;ref name="dominguez19990517"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archivedate=2012-01-12 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=New York Daily News | date=1999-05-17 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 ''Star Trek'' fan convention in [[Las Vegas]] by stating "''Star Wars'' created ''Star Trek''". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first ''Star Wars'' film (''A New Hope''), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A ''Star Trek'' relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/08/07/william-shatner-says-star-wars-created-star-trek/|title=William Shatner Says Star Wars Created Star Trek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was ''Star Wars'' that thrust ''Star Trek'' into the people of Paramount's consciousness" Shatner stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/06/media/william-shatner-star-wars-star-trek/index.html|title=Captain Kirk thanks Star Wars!|first=Jose|last=Pagliery|date=6 August 2016|website=CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/07/star-trek-star-wars-shatner/|title=William Shatner: 'Star Trek' owes a big thanks to 'Star Wars'|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; He explained that while both franchises were so "far out", ''Star Trek'' produced a fanbase that "softened up the entertainment arena" so that ''Star Wars'' could "come along and stand on its shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars/26348/george-lucas-on-how-star-trek-helped-star-wars|title=George Lucas on how Star Trek helped Star Wars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call ''Star Wars'' a "derivative" of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A few references to ''Star Wars'' have been inserted into ''Star Trek'' films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from ''Star Wars'' in both ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/10/star-wars-r2d2-star-trek-into-darkness|title=Star Wars droid R2D2 spotted in Star Trek Into Darkness|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2013-09-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Star Trek'' films and television episodes used the ''Star Wars'' animation shop, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], for their special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilm.com/archive/|title=Archive|newspaper=Industrial Light &amp; Magic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roddenberry was honored at a ''Star Trek'' convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as [[Darth Vader]]. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of ''Star Wars'' and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Comic relief==
William Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' [[American Film Institute]] Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2013/4/film-exclusive|title=Shatner Honors Lucas|publisher=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a live concert, Shatner dressed as an [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|imperial stormtrooper]] singing "[[Girl Crush]]" alongside [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Brad Paisley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753087/william-shatner-star-wars-stormtrooper-girl-crush-cmas|title=William Shatner Dresses as 'Star Wars' Stormtrooper, Sings 'Girl Crush' at CMAs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Shatner and [[Carrie Fisher]] posted a series of humorous YouTube videos [[satire|satirizing]] each other's franchises.

In a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Princess Leia]] eloping and running off into the sunset would be the "perfect union" between ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Shatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his [[Twitter]] account mocking ''Star Wars''. Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received ''Star Wars Holiday Special''. It was then that ''Star Wars'' actor [[Peter Mayhew]] posted a "retaliation" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', another poorly received film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/03/22/william-shatner-cant-stop-trolling-star-wars-fans/|title=William Shatner can't stop trolling Star Wars fans|publisher=The Telegraph}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Both franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.

''Star Trek'' was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' reboot]] (2009), which was followed by ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on [[CBS All Access]], an online streaming platform, in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/new-star-trek-series-premieres-january-2017|title=Star Trek New Star Trek Series Premieres January 2017|work=StarTrek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' picked up from where ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' left off, with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' the first in the new trilogy, and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', a television series set in between the ''Star Wars'' prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone ''Star Wars'' films, starting with ''[[Rogue One]]'', which was released in December 2016, and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' following in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Upcoming-Star-Wars-Movies-List-Titles-Release-Dates-100467.html|title=Upcoming Star Wars Movies: List Of Titles And Release Dates - CINEMABLEND|date=2015-12-16|newspaper=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan works===
{{further|Star Trek fan productions|Star Wars fan films}}
Aside from official works by the producers of ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'', many [[fan film]]s and [[webisode]]s set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in relation to either franchise.

[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en-crop.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map of a segment of Antarctica, identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both [[Roald Amundsen]] (leading his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]]) and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (leading the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) reached the [[South Pole]] within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the [[geographic south pole]] first and subsequently return to their base camp at [[Framheim]] without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.

== Overview ==
The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.
*Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.
*Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.
*Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of [[Hjalmar Johansen]]) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.

Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed,&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; including:

* Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles— I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season—an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cherry Garrard in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'' agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry Garrard, ''The Worst Journey in the World'', chapter 19 "The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier]."&lt;/ref&gt;
* With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that [[#Food and fuel|the rations of Scott's team were inadequate]] and did not provide enough energy for the men.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIX, page 573.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.
* Ponies' coats easily became soaked with [[perspiration]] during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.
* The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant [[Seal meat|seal]] and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.  
* Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&amp;nbsp;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&amp;nbsp;miles short of there. Scott's party died  11&amp;nbsp;miles south of the depot.
* The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again.
* The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite book|last= Preston|first= Diana|title= A First Rate Tragedy|publisher= Constable &amp; Co.|location= London|year= 1997|pages= 218–219|isbn= 0-09-479530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."
* The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.
* The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": "...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather...."
* The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; he states "Man is a poor [[pack animal|beast of burden]], as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

== Objectives of the expeditions ==
Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&amp;nbsp;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&amp;nbsp;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, [[Henry Robertson Bowers]], and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to [[Cherry-Garrard]].

Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under [[Kristian Prestrud]] who conducted an expedition to [[King Edward VII Land]] while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.

== Base camps ==
Amundsen camped on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] at the [[Bay of Whales]] which is 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350&amp;nbsp;miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's base was at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]], with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transport ==
=== Motor sledges ===
The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&amp;nbsp;—dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander [[Reginald William Skelton]]&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910"&gt;Letter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|E.R.G.R. "Teddy" Evans]] as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition.&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910" /&gt; Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to R W Skelton from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ponies vs dogs ===
Scott had used dogs on his first ([[Discovery Expedition|Discovery]]) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his [[Nimrod expedition]] that got to within {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, [[Lawrence Oates]], whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Susan|title=The Coldest March: Scott`s Fatal Antarctic Expedition|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300089678|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-March-Scott-s-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0300089678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764466&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|85}}

There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of [[William Speirs Bruce]] in his Arctic, Antarctic, and [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], Amundsen in the ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition, [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s crossing of [[Greenland]], [[Robert Peary]]'s three attempts at the [[North Pole]], [[Eivind Astrup]]'s work supporting Peary, [[Frederick Cook]]'s discredited North Pole expedition, and [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s explorations of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take "dogs, dogs and more dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = Carl | date = October 2008 | title = The use and abuse of dogs on Scott's and Amundsen's South Pole expeditions | journal = The Polar Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–311 | issn = 0032-2474 | doi=10.1017/s0032247408007493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.'&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed "reluctance" to use dogs in this way: "One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | year = 1962 | title = The South Pole Fifty Years After | url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3571/3546|journal = Arctic | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–178 | doi=10.14430/arctic3571}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = L G | title = The Logistics of the Polar Journeys of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen | date = January 1972 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–47 | pmid = 4552519 | pmc=1644311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they "also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal".&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the [[Inuit]] while on his ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the [[Antarctic]] while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

=== Walking vs skiing on snow ===
Scott took the Norwegian [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] and [[skier]] [[Tryggve Gran]] to the [[Antarctic]] on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.

Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that "Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event".&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, [[Olav Bjaaland]], as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the [[South Pole]].

== Weather conditions ==
Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Simpson]], Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|286}} The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer [[Edgar Evans]] and [[Lawrence Oates]] had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were {{Convert|11|mi|order=flip}} short of One-Ton Depot, which was {{Convert|140|mi|order=flip}} from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.

On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly {{Convert|300|mi|4=-2|order=flip}} in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also blamed "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a "normal" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|318-319}}

== Route marking and depot laying ==
During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) {{Convert|180|mi|order=flip}} of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter X, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.

Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.

== Food and fuel ==
By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573" /&gt; A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the [[BBC]], confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, Blizzard&amp;nbsp;– Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-563-49326-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.

Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]]'s trip with [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard|Cherry-Garrard]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.

Since the rations contained no [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin C|C vitamins]], the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs.  This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntford|first1=Roland|title=The Last Place on Earth|date=1985|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd|location=London|isbn=0340381019|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Place-Earth-Roland-Huntford/dp/0340381019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764934&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553}}

Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.

== Clothing and goggles ==
It has been said (by the present-day explorer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.

Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.

Scott's team suffered regularly from [[snow blindness]] and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.

== Delay in meeting Scott's returning party ==
In 1921, [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|'Teddy' Evans]] wrote in his book ''South with Scott'' that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.{{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;...It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}}}}

He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.

He continued his instructions in the next paragraph "You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173&lt;/ref&gt; with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.

Expedition member [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book ''The Worst Journey in the World''. However, in the 1948 preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gray |first = Richard | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and [[Edward L. Atkinson|Edward Atkinson]] reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}} Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler [[Cecil Meares]] had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".

On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at [[Hut Point]] when, on 19 February, [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Edward Evans]] was lying seriously ill in a tent some {{Convert|35|mi|order=flip|round=5}} to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals&lt;/ref&gt;  Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.

Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]]. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to "use his judgement" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.

On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."

Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.){{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

== Other reasons for Scott's failure ==
; Geology samples
: Scott's team continued to haul over 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, {{ISBN|0-340-82697-5}}-page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tryggve Gran]] on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, {{ISBN|0-340-38101-9}}, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Final five-man team
: Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360&amp;nbsp;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.
; Misuse of the dog team
: For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&amp;nbsp;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428" /&gt; He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within {{Convert|100|km|4=-1}} of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.
; Navigation
: Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a [[sextant]] during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a [[theodolite]] which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|482}} Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|473, 538}}
; Camp routine
: Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}
A '''contraction''' is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.

In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with [[crasis]], [[abbreviation]]s nor [[acronym]]s (including initialisms), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Hart's Rules|New Hart's Rules]]: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-861041-6|year=2005|author = Roberts R|display-authors=etal}} {{rp|p.167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contraction is also distinguished from [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]], where beginnings and endings are omitted.

The definition overlaps with the term [[portmanteau]] (a linguistic ''[[Blend word|blend]]''), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.

== English ==
{{main|English auxiliaries and contractions}}

[[English language|English]] has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an [[apostrophe]] in writing), as in ''I'm'' for "I am", and sometimes other changes as well, as in ''won't'' for "will not" or ''ain't'' for "am not". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of "o'clock").

The main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see [[English auxiliaries and contractions]]).

Some other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of [[elision]], may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as ''wanna'' for ''want to'', ''gonna'' for ''going to'', ''y'all'' for ''you all'',  ''ya'll'' for ''ya all'' in the [[Southern United States]] and others common forms in colloquial speech.

In [[subject–auxiliary inversion]], the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of ''He won't go'' is '''''Won't he''' go'', whereas the uncontracted equivalent is ''Will he not go?'', with ''not'' following the subject.

== Chinese ==

Contractions exist in [[Classical Chinese]], some of which are used in modern Chinese.

== French ==

The [[French language]] has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in ''[[wiktionary:c'est la vie|C'est la vie]]'' ("That's life"), where ''c'est'' stands for ''ce'' + ''est'' ("that is"). The formation of these contractions is called [[Elision (French)|elision]].

In general, any monosyllabic word ending in ''[[e caduc]]'' (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, ''h'' or ''y'' (as ''h'' is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; ''y'' sounds like ''i''). In addition to ''ce'' → ''c'-'' (demonstrative pronoun "that"), these words are ''que'' → ''qu'-'' (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun "that"), ''ne'' → ''n'-'' ("not"), ''se'' → ''s'-'' ("himself", "herself", "itself", "oneself" before a verb), ''je'' → ''j'-'' ("I"), ''me'' → ''m'-'' ("me" before a verb), ''te'' → ''t'- '' (informal singular "you" before a verb), ''le'' or ''la'' → ''l'-'' ("the"; or  "he/she", "it" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''), and ''de'' → ''d'-'' ("of"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) ''*ce est'' or ''*que elle''.

''Moi'' ("myself") and ''toi'' (informal "yourself") mandatorily contract to ''m'-'' and ''t'-'' respectively after an imperative verb and before the word ''y'' or ''en''.

It is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction ''si'' ("if") is followed by ''il'' ("he", "it") or ''ils'' ("they"), which begin with the same vowel sound ''i'': ''*si il'' → ''s'il'' ("if it", if he"); ''*si ils'' → ''s'ils'' ("if they").

Certain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: ''au'' for ''à le'', ''aux'' for ''à les'', ''du'' for ''de le'', and ''des'' for ''de les''. However, the contraction of ''cela'' (demonstrative pronoun "that") to ''ça'' is optional and informal.

In informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, ''je ne sais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʒənəsɛpa|IPA}}, "I don't know") may be pronounced roughly ''chais pas'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛpa|IPA}}), with the ''ne'' being completely elided and the {{IPA-fr|ʒ|}} of ''je'' being mixed with the {{IPA-fr|s|}} of ''sais''.{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}  It is also common in informal contexts to contract ''tu'' to ''t'-'' before a vowel, e.g., ''t'as mangé'' for ''tu as mangé''.

== Hebrew ==

In [[Modern Hebrew]], the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In [[Modern Hebrew|colloquial Israeli Hebrew]], the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter.  Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, "I saw the dog") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).

== Italian ==

In Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions ''a'', ''da'', ''di'', ''in'', ''su'', ''con'' and ''per'' combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely ''il'', ''lo'', ''la'', ''l','' ''i'', ''gli'', ''gl','' and ''le''.

* Contractions with a, da, di, in, and su are mandatory, but those with con and per are optional.
* Words in parentheses are no longer commonly used, but some still exist in common expressions such as ''colla voce''.
* Formerly, ''gl''' was used before words beginning with ''i'', however it is no longer in common use.

The words ''ci'' and ''è'' (form of ''essere'', to be) and the words ''vi'' and ''è'' are contracted into ''c'è'' and ''v'è'' (both meaning "there is").
* “''C'è'' / ''V'è'' un problema”&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; There is a problem

The words ''dove'' and any word that begins with ''e'' are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally ''come'' does be made so.
As well other words may be contracted the same these two, like ''quale'', and other ones, etcetera.

== Spanish ==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: ''al'' (to the) for ''a el'', and ''del'' (of the) for ''de el'' (not to be confused with ''a él'', meaning ''to him'', and ''de él'', meaning ''his'' or, more literally, ''of him'').

Other contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being ''de'' + personal and demonstrative pronouns: ''destas'' for ''de estas'' (of these, fem.), ''daquel'' for ''de aquel'' (of that, masc.), ''dél'' for ''de él'' (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with ''a-'': ''l'alma'' for ''la alma'', now ''el alma'' (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of ''aquí'' (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + ''otro/a'' (other): ''aqueste'', ''aqueso'', ''estotro'' etc. The modern ''aquel'' (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns ''nosotros'' (we) and ''vosotros'' (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: ''todol'' for ''todo el'' (all the, masc.), ''ques'' for ''que es'' (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.

Though not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as ''conmigo'' for *''con mí'' (with me), ''contigo'' for *''con ti'' (with you sing.), ''consigo'' for *''con sí'' (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).

Finally, one can hear {{clarify|reason=in which dialects?|date=January 2014}} ''pa''' for ''para'', deriving as ''pa'l'' for ''para el'', but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.

== Portuguese ==

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, ''de'' (of) and ''por'' (by; formerly ''per'') combine with the definite articles ''o'' and ''a'' (masculine and feminine forms of "the" respectively), producing ''do'', ''da'' (of the), ''pelo'', ''pela'' (by the). The preposition ''de'' contracts with the pronouns ''ele'' and ''ela'' (he, she), producing ''dele'', ''dela'' (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb ''amar'' (to love) combines with the pronoun ''a'' (her), giving ''amá-la'' (to love her).

Another contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun ''da'' with words starting in ''a'', resulting in changing the first letter ''a'' for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: ''Estrela d'alva'' (A popular phrase to refer to [[Venus]] that means "Alb star", as a reference to its brightness) ; ''Caixa d'água'' (water tank).

== German ==

In informal, spoken [[German language|German]] [[prepositional phrase]]s, one can often merge the preposition and the [[article (grammar)|article]]; for example, ''von dem'' becomes ''vom'', ''zu dem'' becomes ''zum'', or ''an das'' becomes ''ans''. Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, ''aufm'' for ''auf dem'', ''unterm'' for ''unter dem'', etc. are also  used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.

The pronoun ''es'' often contracts to ''{{'}}s'' (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting ''Wie geht es?'' is usually encountered in the contracted form ''Wie geht's?''.

=== Local languages in German-speaking areas ===

[[Dialectology|Regional dialects]] of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's [[Standard German]] was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as ''in den'' becoming ''in'n'' (sometimes ''im'') or ''haben wir'' becoming ''hamwer'', ''hammor'', ''hemmer'', or ''hamma'' depending on local intonation preferences. [[Bavarian language|Bavarian German]] features several more contractions such as ''gesund sind wir'' becoming ''xund samma'' which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German ''wir'' exists alongside Bavarian ''mir'', or ''mia'', with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has as his catchphrase "Schau mer mal" ("Schauen wir einmal" - in English "let's have a look"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, "Schau'n Mer Mal".

Such features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: ''Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?'' is spoken as ''Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?''

Several [[West Central German]] dialects along the [[Rhine River]] have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of [[liaison (French)|"liaison"]] is used. So, ''[Dat] kriegst Du nicht'' may become ''Kressenit'', or ''Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt'' may become ''Lomejon haschjesaat''.

Mostly, there are no binding [[orthography|orthographies]] for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to  degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.

== Norwegian ==

The use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are "jakke" for "jeg har ikke", meaning "I do not have" and "dække" for "det er ikke", meaning "there is not". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often [[Syllable|monosyllabic]] words like {{wt|nb|jeg}}, {{wt|nb|du}}, {{wt|nb|deg}}, {{wt|nb|det}}, {{wt|nb|har}} or {{wt|nb|ikke}}. The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.

In extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is "Det ordner seg av seg selv" in standard written [[Bokmål]], meaning "It will sort itself out" could become "dånesæsæsjæl" (note the letters [[Å]] and [[Æ]], and the word "sjæl", as an [[eye dialect]] spelling of {{wt|nb|selv}}). [[R-dropping]], being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway {{which|date=March 2018}}, but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like {{IPA|/ə/}}.

Because of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official [[Norwegian orthography|orthography]]. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.

== Latin ==

Latin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb ''nolo'' (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of ''non volo'' (''volo'' meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).

== Japanese ==

Some contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (''-ssu'') for です (''desu'') and すいません (''suimasen'') for すみません (''sumimasen''). では (''dewa'') is often contracted to じゃ (''ja''). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (''no'') is contracted to simply ん (''n'').

When used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (''-te''), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:

|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated ''ikimasu'' (go) and the verb ''kimasu'' (come).

The ending ～なければ (''-nakereba'') can be contracted to ～なきゃ (''-nakya'') when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (''ikanakya (ikenai)'') "I have to go."

Other times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:
* The word 何か (''nanika'') "something" is contracted to なんか (''nanka'') to make a colloquial word with a meaning along the lines of "sort of," but which can be used with almost no meaning. Its usage is as a filler word is similar to English "like."
* じゃない (''ja nai'') "is not" is contracted to じゃん (''jan'') which is used at the end of statements to show the speaker's belief or opinion, often when it is contrary to that of the listener, e.g., いいじゃん！ (''ii jan!'') "What, it's fine!"
* The commonly used particle-verb phrase という (''to iu'') is often contracted to ～って／～て／～っつー (''-tte/-te/-ttsū'') to give a more informal or noncommittal feeling.
* といえば (''to ieba''), the conditional form of という (''to iu'') mentioned above, is contracted to ～ってば (''-tte ba'') to show the speaker's annoyance at the listener's failure to listen to, remember, or heed what the speaker has said, e.g., もういいってば！ (''mō ii tte ba!''), “I already told you I don't want to talk about it anymore!”.
* The common words だ (''da'') and です (''desu'') are older contractions that originate from である (''de aru'') and でございます (''de gozaimasu''). These are fully integrated into the language now, and are not generally thought of as contractions; however in formal writing (e.g., literature, news articles, or technical/scientific writing), である (''de aru'') is used in place of だ (''da'').
* The [[Japanese pronouns|first-person singular pronoun]] 私 is pronounced わたくし (''watakushi'') in very formal speech, but commonly contracted to わたし(''watashi'') in less formal speech, and further clipped in specifically younger women's speech to あたし (''atashi'').

Various [[Japanese dialects|dialects of Japanese]] also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.

== Polish ==

In the [[Polish language]] pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are ''go'' and ''mu''. The non-contracted forms are ''jego'' (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and ''jemu'', respectively. The [[clitic]] ''-ń'' which stands for ''niego'' (him) as in ''dlań'' (''dla niego'') is more common in literature.  The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkjp.pl/settings/papers/NKJP_ksiazka.pdf (p.82)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uyghur ==

[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]], includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of [[compound verb]]s ([[serial verb construction|serial verbs]]). For instance, ''sëtip alidu'' (sell-manage, "manage to sell") is usually written and pronounced ''sëtivaldu'', with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] [[lenition|leniting]] into a [v] or [w].{{Original research inline|date=March 2010}}

== Filipino/Tagalog ==

In Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like "at" and "ay." In this chart, the "@" represents any vowel.

{{wiktionary}}
The term '''cross-reference''' can refer to either:
* An instance within a [[document]] which refers to related information elsewhere in the same document. In both printed and online dictionaries cross-references are important because they form a network structure of relations existing between different parts of data, dictionary-internal as well as dictionary external.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Nielsen (1999): "Mediostructures in Bilingual LSP Dictionaries." In: ''Lexicographica. International Annual for Lexicography'' 15, 90–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a cross reference is often denoted by ''See also''.  For example, under the term ''Albert Einstein'' in the index of a book about Nobel Laureates, there may be the cross-reference ''See also: Einstein, Albert''.
* In [[hypertext]], cross-referencing is maintained to a document with either in-context (XRIC) or out-of-context (''XROC'') cross-referencing.  These are similar to [[Key Word in Context|KWIC and KWOC]].
* In programming, "cross-referencing" means the listing of every file name and line number where a given [[identifier#In computer science|named identifier]] occurs within the program's [[source tree]].
* In a [[relational database management system]], a table can have an xref as prefix or suffix to indicate it is a [[cross-reference table]] that joins two or more tables together via [[primary key]].

== Structure of a cross reference ==
In a document, especially those authored in a [[Content management system]],
a cross-reference has two major aspects:
* A visible form that appears when the document is presented to the reader
* A technical mechanism that resides within the system

The visible form contains text, graphics, and other indications that:
* Enable the reader to follow the cross reference to the referenced content
* May enable the reader to understand what is being referred to, or what to expect upon following the reference
* May present to the reader some information from the referenced content

The technical mechanism that resides within the system:
* Identifies what location is being referred to
* Permits the system to present appropriate referencing text when the location containing the reference is presented to a reader
* Permits the system to offer a control (such as a link) that a reader can use when the content is presented in electronic form to access the referenced content

== How cross references contribute to usability of a document or set of documents ==
If the cross reference mechanism is well designed, the reader will be able to follow each cross reference to the referenced content whether the content is presented in print or electronically.

An author working in a content management system is responsible for identifying subjects of interest that cross documents, and creating appropriate systems of cross references to support readers who seek to understand those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockley|first1=Ann|last2=Cooper|first2=Charles|title=Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy|date=2012|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0321815361|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual cross reference, an author should ensure that location and content of the target of the cross reference are clearly identified, and the reader can easily determine how to follow the cross reference in each medium in which publication is supported.

[[Content strategy]] practitioners (known as content strategists) specialize in planning content to meet business needs, taking into account the processes for creating and maintaining the content, and the systems that support the content.

[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|A multi-volume Latin dictionary by [[Egidio Forcellini]].]]
[[File:Woerterbuchstapel Langenscheidt.jpg|thumb|[[Langenscheidt]] dictionaries]]
A '''dictionary''', sometimes known as a '''wordbook''', is a collection of [[word]]s in one or more specific [[language]]s, often arranged [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] (or by [[radical-and-stroke sorting|radical and stroke]] for [[ideographic]] languages), which may include information on [[definition]]s, usage, [[etymologies]], [[pronunciation]]s, translation, etc.&lt;ref name = Web1&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a [[lexicon]].&lt;ref name = Web1/&gt; It is a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Nielsen, Sandro |year = 2008 |title = The Effect of Lexicographical Information Costs on Dictionary Naming and Use | url = | journal = Lexikos |volume = 18 |issn= 1684-4904 |pages = 170–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad distinction is made between general and [[specialized dictionaries]]. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether [[lexicology]] and [[terminology]] are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to be [[Semasiology|semasiological]], mapping word to [[definition]], while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be [[Onomasiology|onomasiological]], first identifying [[concept]]s and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types.&lt;ref name="Sterkenburg2003"&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance [[bilingual dictionary|bilingual (translation) dictionaries]], dictionaries of [[synonym]]s ([[thesaurus|thesauri]]), and [[rhyming]] dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose [[monolingual dictionary]].&lt;ref name=Sintro&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a contrast between [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']] dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. "informal" or "vulgar") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first recorded dictionaries date back to [[Sumer]]ian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called [[lexicography]], and largely initiated by [[Ladislav Zgusta]].&lt;ref name=Sintro/&gt; The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of "astonishing" lack of method and critical-self reflection.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

==History==
The oldest known dictionaries were [[Akkadian Empire]] cuneiform tablets with bilingual [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]–[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] wordlists, discovered in [[Ebla]] (modern [[Syria]]) and dated roughly 2300 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name="imlqdg"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html#p3 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbLyr75?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 2nd millennium BCE ''[[Urra=hubullu]]'' glossary is the canonical [[Babylonia]]n version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A [[Chinese dictionary]], the c. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]'', was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE [[Shizhoupian]] as a "dictionary", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of [[Chinese character]]s from [[Zhou dynasty]] bronzes. [[Philitas of Cos]] (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Átaktoi glôssai}}'') which explained the meanings of rare [[Homer]]ic and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Peter Bing |title= The unruly tongue: Philitas of Cos as scholar and poet |journal= Classical Philology |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=330–348 |doi=10.1086/422370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius the Sophist]] (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon.&lt;ref name = "imlqdg"/&gt; The first [[Sanskrit]] dictionary, the [[Amarakosha|Amarakośa]], was written by [[Amara Sinha]] c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the first [[Japanese dictionaries#Early Japanese lexicography|Japanese dictionary]] was the long-lost 682 CE ''Niina'' glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'', was also a glossary of written Chinese. In ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]'', [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Heterogram (linguistics)|heterograms]] are listed together with their translation in [[Middle Persian]] language and phonetic transcription in [[Pazand]] alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, [[Sanas Cormaic]], contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, [[Amir Khusro]] compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nouveau Dictionnaire Larousse page.JPG|thumb|The French-language ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' is an example of an illustrated dictionary.]]

[[Arabic]] dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the [[root (linguistics)|radicals]], or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]], while most general use dictionaries, such as the ''Lisan al-`Arab'' (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and ''al-Qamus al-Muhit'' (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The ''Qamus al-Muhit'' is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the ''Lisan'' and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ḳāmūs", J. Eckmann, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed., Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval Europe, [[glossary|glossaries]] with equivalents for Latin words in [[vernacular]] or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the [[Leiden Glossary]]). The ''[[Catholicon (1286)|Catholicon]]'' (1287) by [[John of Genoa|Johannes Balbus]], a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 [[Ambrogio Calepino]]'s ''Dictionarium'' was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 [[Robert Estienne]] published the ''Thesaurus linguae latinae'' and in 1572 his son [[Henri Estienne]] published the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'', which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by [[Sebastián Covarrubias]]' ''[[Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española]]'', published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española'', edición integral e ilustrada de Ignacio Arellano y Rafael Zafra, Madrid, Iberoamericana-Vervuert, 2006, pg. XLIX.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1612 the first edition of the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]'', for [[italian language|Italian]], was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in [[Rotterdam]] was published, posthumously, the ''Dictionnaire Universel'' by [[Antoine Furetière]] for [[french language|French]]. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]''. Between 1712 and 1721 was published the ''Vocabulario portughez e latino'' written by Raphael Bluteau. The [[Real Academia Española]] published the first edition of the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' in 1780, but their ''Diccionario de Autoridades'', which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The ''Totius Latinitatis lexicon'' by [[Egidio Forcellini]] was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.

The first edition of ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' by [[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the [[Deutsches Wörterbuch]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]]; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the ''Dizionario della lingua italiana'' by [[Niccolò Tommaseo]]. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of ''A magyar nyelv szótára'' (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. [[Émile Littré]] published the [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Dictionnaire de la langue française]] between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 [[Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl]] published the ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language]]''. The [[Duden]] dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the [[prescriptive]] source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'' was taken in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/|title=OSA – Om svar anhålles|website=g3.spraakdata.gu.se|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English dictionaries in Britain===

The earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word "dictionary" was invented by an Englishman called [[John of Garland]] in 1220 — he had written a book ''[[Dictionarius (Johannes de Garlandia)|Dictionarius]]'' to help with Latin "diction".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. // Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, 2011. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the ''Elementarie'', created by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/dic/mul/elementarie.html|title=1582 - Mulcaster's Elementarie|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html A Brief History of English Lexicography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309181613/http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html |date=2008-03-09 }}, Peter Erdmann and See-Young Cho, [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Universität Berlin]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was ''[[Table Alphabeticall|A Table Alphabeticall]]'', written by English schoolteacher [[Robert Cawdrey]] in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is "a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Jack Lynch, “How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary” (delivered 25 August 2005 at the Johnson and the English Language conference, Birmingham)] Retrieved July 12, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his "English Expositor". ''Glossographia'' by [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]], published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. [[Edward Phillips]] wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled "[[The New World of English Words]]: Or a General Dictionary" which boldly [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] Blount's work, and the two denounced {{clarify|date=November 2016}} each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. [[John Wilkins]]' 1668 [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|essay on philosophical language]] contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Considine|title=Dictionaries in Early Modern Europe: Lexicography and the Making of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqBkQFiTbX4C&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=27 March 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88674-1|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisha Coles]] published his "English Dictionary" in 1676.

It was not until [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html|title=Lynch, "How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary"|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first "modern" dictionary.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"/&gt;

Johnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the [[Oxford University Press]] began writing and releasing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in short [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete ''OED'' in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, [[William Chester Minor]], a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American English dictionaries===
In 1806, American [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, ''[[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language]]''. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]].

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing "colour" with "color", substituting "wagon" for "waggon", and printing "center" instead of "centre". He also added American words, like "skunk" and "squash", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.

==Types==

In a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425064041/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (morphology)|undeclined or unconjugated]] form appears as the [[headword]] in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like [[StarDict]] and the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' are dictionary software running on [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] or [[computer]]s. There are also many [[List of online dictionaries|online dictionaries]] accessible via the [[Internet]].

===Specialized dictionaries===
{{main|Specialized dictionary}}
According to the ''Manual of Specialized Lexicographies'', a [[specialized dictionary]], also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in ''The Bilingual LSP Dictionary'', [[lexicographers]] categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A [[multi-field dictionary]] broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a [[business dictionary]]), a [[single-field dictionary]] narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe]] is a multi-field dictionary, the [[American National Biography]] is a single-field, and the [[African American National Biography Project]] is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between "minimizing dictionaries" and "maximizing dictionaries", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'' and ''[[Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|title=The first English to Einglish and Sindhi Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms published - The Sindh Times|first=The Sindh|last=Times|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021439/http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'').

Another variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine ([[medical dictionary]]).

===Defining dictionaries===
The simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.

===Prescriptive vs. descriptive===
Lexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']]. [[Noah Webster]], intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling ''color'' while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers ''colour''. (Similarly, [[British English]] subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at [[American and British English spelling differences]].)&lt;ref name="Benson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Benson|title=Ethnocentrism and the English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeuW7oy7-58C&amp;pg=PA8|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large 20th-century dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) and ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]]'' are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade|author2=Wim van der Wurff|title=Current Issues in Late Modern English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x91EUnnWwR8C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''stand'' (nonstandard). ''[[American Heritage Dictionary|American Heritage]]'' goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous "usage notes." ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, "an offensive term for..." or "a taboo term meaning...".

Because of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Halley, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Modern English Grammar'' (2005), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to "El otro, el mismo": "''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''"

Sometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ''Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary'' is "at war with itself": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its [[Niqqud|vocalization]] is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as ''hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít'' (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas ''hi taharóg otí'', literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (1999). [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/review-of-the-oxford-english-hebrew- Review of the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary], ''[[International Journal of Lexicography]]'' 12.4, pp. 325-346.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical dictionaries ===
A [[historical dictionary]] is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.

===Dictionaries for natural language processing===
In contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for [[natural language processing]] (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see [[Diathesis alternation]]). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control [[machine translation]]s or [[cross-lingual information retrieval]] (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called [[Lexical Markup Framework]] (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.

==Pronunciation==
{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects|Pronunciation respelling for English}}
In many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently  apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word ''dictionary'' might be followed by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] spelling {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|ʃ|ə|n|ɛr|i}}. American English dictionaries often use their own[[pronunciation respelling]] systems with [[diacritic]]s, for example ''dictionary''  is respelled as "dĭk'''′'''shə-nĕr′ē" in the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]].{{refn|{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|dictionary}}}} The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, ''dictionary'' may be respelled as {{respell|DIK|shə|nerr|ee}}. Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.

==Online dictionaries==

The age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]] in 2013 noted that "Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.' Teaching users about words they don’t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]], [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/the-role-of-a-dictionary/?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130518  The Role of a Dictionary] in "Opinionator: Exclusive Online Commentary from the Times", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of [[neologisms]]. Some of the more notable examples include:

'''Diels–Kranz''' ('''DK''') '''numbering''' is the standard system for referencing the works of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, based on the collection of quotations from and reports of their work, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' ('''''The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), by [[Hermann Alexander Diels]]. The ''Fragmente'' was first published in 1903, was later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and was finally revised in a fifth edition (1934–7) by [[Walther Kranz]] and again in a sixth edition (1952). In Diels-Kranz, each passage, or item, is assigned a number which is used to uniquely identify the ancient personality with which it is concerned, and the type of item given. Diels-Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers, and the system also encompasses [[Sophist|Sophists]] and [[Homer|pre-Homeric]] poets such as [[Orpheus]].

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to [[Plato]], and [[Bekker numbering]] is the comparable system for referring to [[Aristotle]].

== Background ==
The works of the pre-Socratics have not survived extant to the present day. Our knowledge of them exists only through references in the works of later philosophers (known as [[doxography]]) in the form of quotations and paraphrases. For example, our knowledge of [[Thales of Miletus]] comes largely from the works of Aristotle, who lived centuries after him. Another interesting example of such a source is [[Hippolytus of Rome]], whose polemic ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'' is a source of many direct quotations of [[Heraclitus]] as well as of other philosophers, thereby perpetuating the work of those he was refuting.

These quotations, paraphrases and other references to pre-Socratic philosophers were collected by Diels and Kranz in their book, which became a standard text in modern pre-Socratic education and scholarship. Because of its influence, Diels-Kranz numbering became the standard way of referencing the material: in literature, conferences, and even in conversation.

== Numbering system ==
The number corresponding to an item was made up of three parts:

# a number representing the personality the item is concerned with - this number is also the chapter number in the ''Fragmente''.  For example, "11", also the eleventh chapter of the ''Fragmente'', refers to [[Thales]].
# the letter ''A'', ''B'', or ''C'', corresponding to the type of item given, respectively:
#:A: ''Testimonia'': These are accounts of the authors' life and doctrines. ''Testimonia'' include commentaries on the works of the pre-Socratics and accounts of their lives and of their philosophical views.
#:B: ''Ipsissima Verba'': Literally translated to "exact words", and sometimes also termed "fragments", these are items containing exact words of the author in the form of quotations in later works.
#:C: ''Imitations'': Works which take the author as a model.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/diels-kr/|title=IEP: "Diels-Kranz Numbering System"|website=www.iep.utm.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a number representing the position of the particular item in its chapter.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why, take the case of Thales, Theodorus. While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0172:text=Theaet.:page=174|title=Plato, Theaetetus, page 174|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above text has a DK number of 11A9, since it refers to Thales who is, as mentioned above, chapter 11's subject. The source is ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' (one of [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]]), and gives an account of Thales' life, hence it is a ''testimonium'', represented by the letter ''A''. Finally, it is the ninth item in its chapter, giving it the overall number of DK 11A9.

Sometimes, the chapter (personality) number may simply be replaced by the name, which can be helpful in cases where the former is the same as the passage number, to avoid ambiguity.  For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who seek for gold dig up much earth and find a little.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|wslink=Fragments_of_Heraclitus#Fragment_22|title=Fragments of Heraclitus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than "22B22" the above may also instead be referred to as "Heraclitus B22" as it is a direct transmission of the words of Heraclitus (thus, B) and is the 22nd item in the chapter about Heraclitus (whose chapter number is also 22) in the ''Fragmente''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/heraclit|title=Heraclitus|website=www.iep.utm.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table==

The following table gives the Diels-Kranz numbering of Pre-Socratic philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Kathleen |date=1959 |title=The Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A Companion to Diels, ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' (Second Ed.) |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=v-vii }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Kathleen |date=1971 |title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A complete translation of the Fragments in Diels, ''Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=vii-ix |quote=1971 Importation, SBN 674-03500-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/app/app01.htm |title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: Contents |website=[[Internet Sacred Text Archive|Sacred Texts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |date=2000 |title=The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and the Sophists |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=345-349 |isbn=9780199539093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Kathleen Freeman (classicist)|Kathleen Freeman]] adopted the fifth edition's numberings for both her ''Companion'' and ''Ancilla'', while also reproducing the fourth edition's numberings in parentheses.  A matching online version of the ''Ancilla's'' table of contents is available at Sacred Texts, for reference.  Later, [[Robin Waterfield]] prepared a new Pre-Socratic reader, which uses an entirely different scheme unrelated to Diels-Kranz.  Nevertheless, Waterfield gives a partial concordance of his own scheme with that of Diels-Kranz, and the partial DK numbering given by Waterfield matches the fifth-edition ''Fragmente'' numbering used by Freeman, so far as it is taken in Waterfield's case.}}  Note that the numbering scheme presented is that of the fifth edition of ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', the first to be revised by Kranz.  The fifth edition's numbering is the scheme which has since gained the most traction in modern Pre-Socratic scholarship, and it is the one used consistently throughout this article.  It should not be confused with the numberings given in other versions, which changed frequently depending on the particular edition of the ''Fragmente''.{{efn|For one example of a variant edition and numbering scheme, see ix-x in the following link.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/diefragmenteder00krangoog |title=Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker |date=1903 |website=[[Internet Archive|archive.org]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most entries (78) are concerned with a single, named individual, while the remaining minority of entries (12) have more complex context.  Of these latter, eight (10, 19, 39, 46, 53-56) are each concerned with groups of named personalties, who typically have a clear relationship of some kind to justify their association in each entry.  Two entries (58, 79) are devoted not to individuals, but to schools of thought (Pythagoreanism and Sophism), and the last two (89, 90) reproduce contemporaneous anonymous texts.  Although "the Seven Sages of Greece" implies a clearly defined set of seven people, historical disagreement renders intractable the problem of exactly who they were, with multiple sources suggesting several different candidates.  If one takes the Seven Sages as a group of seven and includes the later Iamblichus, Diels-Kranz encompasses 106 named personalities and two anonymous authors.  The chapter on Sophism is concerned with the named sophists who take up most of the rest of the scheme, and 
per Freeman with regard to the chapter on Pythagoreanism, a catalogue due to Iamblichus lists 218 named men and 17 named women as Pythagoreans, along with other probable, anonymous adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman's ''Companion'', 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;

In several cases, the personalities listed are so obscure that they are merely mentioned by name in other sources, commonly with hints as to their geographical and philosophical associations, and without even surviving ''paraphrases'' of any of their ideas, or what they might have written.  That is, these more obscure personalities survive in the historical record only as names cited by others, and so came to be included in Diels-Kranz for the sake of scholarly completeness.

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

'''Digital reference''' (or '''virtual reference''') is a service by which a [[library]] reference service is conducted online, and the reference transaction is a [[computer-mediated communication]]. It is the remote, NextNextcomputer-mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word "[[reference]]" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using [[reference work]]s, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc.  This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a "virtual" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations.

The terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pace |first=A. |title=Virtual Reference: What's in a Name? |journal=Computers in Libraries |date=April 2003 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is "virtual reference", with the secondary non-preferred term "digital reference" having gone out of use in recent years. "Chat reference" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, "synchronous virtual reference" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.&lt;ref name="Kern"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kern |first=M.K. |title=Virtual Reference Best Practices: Tailoring Services to Your Library |place=Chicago |publisher=ALA |year=2009}} {{ISBN|978-0-8389-0975-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by [[e-mail]]. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology.

With the advent of the graphical [[World Wide Web]], libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email.

In the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as "AskA" services. Examples of AskA services are the [[Internet Public Library]], [http://mathforum.org/dr.math/ Ask Dr. Math], and [http://americanart.si.edu/search/search_ajoa.cfm Ask Joan of Art].

Providing remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years.  For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries.&lt;ref name="Kern" /&gt; Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services.&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=G.G. |title=Librarianship: an introduction |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services.&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brophy |first=P. |title=The library in the twenty-first century |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current [[cyberculture]] and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the "Google Generation", of users who have grown up with the internet.&lt;ref name="Row"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rowlands |first=I. |title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future |journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=290–310 |year=2008 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1733495&amp;show=abstract |doi=10.1108/00012530810887953}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded [[Web 2.0]] (online social media such as [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[blogs]], [[del.icio.us]], [[Flickr]], etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services.&lt;ref name="Xiao"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xiao |first=N. |title=Web 2.0 as catalyst: Virtually reaching out to users and connecting them to library resources and services |journal=Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship |volume=55 |issue=Fall |year=2008 |url=http://www.istl.org/08-fall/article2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users.

The range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Marjorie E. "Cost Analysis of Library Reference Services," Advances in Library Administration and Organization, 11, 1993, pp. 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Lorraine, &amp; Pomerantz, Jeffrey. "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pla.0.0035 Virtual Reference, Real Money: Modeling Costs in Virtual Reference Services]," portal: Libraries and the Academy, 9, 2009, pp. 133-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of digital reference==

===Webforms===
Webforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question.  This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for.  Creation of webforms requires design consideration.  Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function.

Aspects commonly found within webforms:

*A return email address to send the answer to the question
*The question being asked
*The type of question
*What sources have been consulted by the patron
*How the patron is planning to use the information
*Location of the patron (are they a library patron?)
*A name to personalize the interaction
*A date by which the information is needed
*The type of sources being requested (print or electronic)&lt;ref&gt;Janes, Joseph. "Introduction to Reference Work in the Digital Age", pages 64-65. Neal-Schuman Publishers Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chat using commercial applications===
Several applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Some of these applications are: [http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint], [https://www.omnireference.com/ OmniReference], [http://tutor.com/ Tutor.com], [https://libraryh3lp.com/ LibraryH3lp], [http://aspiringkidz.com/ AspiringKidz.com], and [http://Vienova.com/ Vienova.com]. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk applications. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co-browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre-scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting.

===Chat using instant messaging===
{{See also|chatbot|virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)}}
[[Instant messaging]] (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free.  Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet.  This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian.  On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron.  IM reference services may be for the use of in-house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public.

Successful IM reference services will:
*Create a profile to convey information about the library and increase online presence.
*Accept imperfection in conversations without spending time to go back and make corrections.  Most words are recognizable through context.
*Become familiar with and use accepted IM abbreviations such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud).
*Don't panic.  While speed is important it is more important to not feel rushed.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rick. "IM Me", Library Journal 130 (April 1, 2005): 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Christina M. &amp; Graves, Stephanie J. "Instruction via Instant Messaging reference: what’s happening?", The Electronic Library 24 (2) ( 2006): 174-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software for providing digital reference==
The article [http://slj.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA251679 Live, Digital Reference Marketplace] by Buff Hirko contains a comparison of the features of applications for chat-based reference.

See the entries in the [http://www.libsuccess.org/index.php?title=Online_Reference Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section], including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference.

===Software features===
Virtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs.&lt;ref name="Bro" /&gt; However, each program may have several distinct features. A [[knowledge base]] is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of [[frequently asked questions]] (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure.

Online chat, or [[instant messaging]] (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature.  Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language.  Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff.

The use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years.  Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat.  In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response.

With the increase in use of text messaging ([[Short Message Service]] or SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. [[Librarian]]s can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging.

[[Co-browsing]], or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images.&lt;ref name="Hua"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hua |first=Z. |title="Chapter 2.10: A Cooperative Framework for Information Browsing in Mobile Environment". In: Taniar, D. (2008) Mobile Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications |place=London |publisher=Information Science Reference |pages=497–505 |year=2008 |url=http://www.igi-global.com/reference|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The UK==

Virtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"&gt;Barry, E et al (2010) Virtual Reference in UK academic libraries: The virtual enquiry project 2008–2009, Library Review, Vol. 59 (1) pp.40-55&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"/&gt;

UK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, S. (1998) Delivering the New Public Library: the role of the EARL Consortium, INFOCUS 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt; in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK-wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide),&lt;ref&gt;Berube, L. (2005) People's Network Enquire: virtual reference in England, World Library and Information Congress: 71st IFLA General Conference and Council, August 14th - 18th 2005, Oslo, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council),&lt;ref&gt;SLIC homepage: http://www.slainte.org.uk/slic/slicindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. It uses the [[Online Computer Library Center]]'s QuestionPoint software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Library Association's digital reference guidelines==
The definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components:

# "Virtual reference is reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet technology to communicate with reference staff, without being physically present. Communication channels used frequently in virtual reference include chat, videoconferencing, Voice over IP, co-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging.
# While online sources are often utilized in provision of virtual reference, use of electronic sources in seeking answers is not of itself virtual reference.
# Virtual reference queries are sometimes followed-up with telephone, fax, in-person and regular mail interactions, even though these modes of communication are not considered virtual."&lt;ref name="MARS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee |year=2004 |title=Guidelines for Implementing and Maintaining Virtual Reference Services |journal=Reference and User Services Quarterly |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/rusa/resources/guidelines/virtrefguidelines.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 [[QuestionPoint]] and the [[American Library Association]] were in talks about offering a National Ask A Librarian service across the whole United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;http://questionpoint.blogs.com/questionpoint_247_referen/2011/01/a-national-virtual-reference-service-for-the-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; At present the Ask services in the US are run at a local level.

==Other countries==
In Europe some countries offer services in both their own national language and in English. European countries include: Finland,&lt;ref&gt;Finnish National Libraries online reference service: http://www.libraries.fi/en-GB/ask/&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands (in Dutch only),&lt;ref&gt;The Netherlands online reference service: http://www2.bibliotheek.nl/home&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Danish Libraries homepage, with links to a virtual reference form: http://bibliotek.dk/?lingo=eng&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;Public library of Lyon, France: http://www.guichetdusavoir.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries which offer virtual reference services include: Australia,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.nla.gov.au/askalibrarian/&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of New Zealand's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.natlib.govt.nz/services/get-advice/ask-a-librarian&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Canada's virtual reference services: http://vrl.tpl.toronto.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Colorado in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Colorado, the service from the state of Colorado in the USA: {{cite web|url=http://www.askcolorado.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725045834/http://www.askcolorado.org/ |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chasing the Sun==

A collaboration between UK and Australian library services, entitled Chasing the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changechampions.com.au/resource/Sue_Rockliff.pdf PDF presentation by Chasing the Sun Co-chair Sue Rockliff]&lt;/ref&gt; has been initiated using [[QuestionPoint]] software so that an all-hours digital reference chat service can be offered.  Targeted at health libraries where reference queries from health professionals could occur at any time of the day or night due to medical emergencies, the collaboration between the two countries means that someone will be on hand to field the query at any time. Although the UK libraries involved are currently based in England the programme may expand to other countries and health services if successful.

It is often applied as a [[disclaimer]] in situations in which the information to which it is applied is relatively fast-moving. In [[legal term]]s, it seeks to make a statement that information cannot be relied upon, or may have changed by the time of use.

It is regularly used in accounting, to "excuse slight mistakes or oversights."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Rapalje, Robert Linn Lawrence.

Frederick D. Linn &amp; Company, 1888
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used when a large amount of information is listed against a product, to state that—to the best of the supplier's knowledge—the information is correct, but that they will not be held responsible if an error has been committed.

{{other uses|ID (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}

'''''idem.''''' is a [[Latin]] term meaning "the same".  It is commonly [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''''id.''''',
which is particularly used in legal citations to denote the previously cited source (compare ''[[ibid.]]''). It is also used in academic citations to replace the name of a repeated author. 

''Id.'' is employed extensively in [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Law of Canada|legislation]] and in [[United states legislative branch|legal documents of the United States]] to apply a short description to a section with the same focus as the previous.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. 9th circuit appeals court|title=9th circuit appeals court - opinion of judges (9 Feb 2017) - State of Washington v. Donald J.Trump|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf|website=www.cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Id'' is masculine and neuter;  '''''ead.''''' (feminine), is the abbreviation for '''''eadem''''', which also translates to "the same". 

As an abbreviation, ''Id.'' always takes a period (or full stop) in both British and American usage (see [[Full stop#Abbreviations and personal titles of address|usage of the full stop in abbreviations]]). Its first known use dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ''Idem'' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idem |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary}}

==Use==
===Legal===
*''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte'', 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976).
*''Id.'' at 547.

Here, the first citation refers to the case of ''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte.'' The volume number cited is 428 and the page on which the case begins is 543, and the page number cited to is 545.  The "U.S." between the numerical portions of the citation refers to the ''[[United States Reports]]''. 1976 refers to the year that the case was published.  The second citation references the first citation and automatically incorporates the same reporter and volume number; however, the page number cited is now 547. ''Id.'' refers to the immediately preceding citation, so if the previous citation includes more than one reference, or it is unclear which reference ''Id.'' refers to, its usage is inappropriate.

* ''"...the Executive Order declares that “the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.” Id. It asserts, “Deteriorating..."'' (from page 2 of [http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf State of Washington v. Donald J. Trump])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''KWIC''' is an acronym for '''Key Word In Context''', the most common format for [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] lines. The term KWIC was first coined by [[Hans Peter Luhn]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, C. D., Schütze, H.: "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing", p.35. The MIT Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The system was based on a concept called ''keyword in titles'' which was first proposed for Manchester libraries in 1864 by [[Andrea Crestadoro]].&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Indexing and Abstracting Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUkl7bLzYUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Andrea+Crestadoro#v=onepage&amp;q=Andrea%20Crestadoro&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''KWIC''' index is formed by sorting and aligning the words within an article title to allow each word (except the [[stop words]]) in titles to be searchable alphabetically in the index.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janda.org/workshop/content%20analysis/kwic.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was a useful indexing method for technical manuals before computerized [[full text search]] became common.

For example, a search query including all of the words in the title statement of this article ("KWIC is an acronym for Key Word In Context, the most common format for concordance lines") and the [[Wikipedia:Slogans|Wikipedia slogan]] in English ("the free encyclopedia"), searched against this very web page, might yield a KWIC index as follows. A KWIC index usually uses a wide layout to allow the display of maximum 'in context' information (not shown in the following example).

A KWIC index is a special case of a ''permuted index''.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/lang/python/examples/kwic/web/theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; This term refers to the fact that it indexes all [[cyclic permutation]]s of the headings. Books composed of many short sections with their own descriptive headings, most notably collections of [[Manual page (Unix)|manual pages]], often ended with a '''permuted index''' section, allowing the reader to easily find a section by any word from its heading. This practice, also known as '''KWOC''' (“'''Key Word Out of Context'''”), is no longer common.

[[File:Gǔjīn Túshū Jíchéng page.png|thumb|upright|A page from the ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever printed]]

The '''''leishu''''' ({{zh|t=類書|l=category books}}) is a genre of [[Reference work|reference books]] historically compiled in China and other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]]. The term is generally translated as "encyclopedia", although the ''leishu'' are quite different from the modern notion of [[encyclopedia]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

== Overview ==

The ''leishu'' are composed of sometimes lengthy citations from other works,{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} and often contain copies of entire works, not just excerpts.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The works are classified by a systematic set of categories, which are further divided into subcategories.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} ''Leishu'' may be considered [[anthologies]], but are encyclopedic in the sense that they may comprise the entire realm of knowledge at the time of compilation.{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}}

Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled from the early third century until the eighteenth century, of which 200 have survived.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=603}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled was the 1408 ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', containing 370 million [[Chinese characters]],{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} and the largest ever printed was the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

==History==
[[File:Yongle Dadian Encyclopedia 1403.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled]]

The genre first appeared in the early third century. The earliest known was the ''[[Huanglan]]'' ("Emperor's mirror"{{efn|Compare the later "[[speculum literature]]" in the Western tradition.}}). Sponsored by the emperor of [[Cao Wei]], it was compiled around 220, but has since [[Lost works|been lost]].{{sfn|Zurndorfer|2013|p=505}} However, the term ''leishu'' was not used until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=46}}

In later imperial China dynasties, such as the [[Ming]] and [[Qing]], emperors sponsored monumental projects to compile all known human knowledge into a single ''leishu'', in which entire works, rather than excerpts, were copied and classified by category.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}} The largest ''leishu'' ever compiled, on the order of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of Ming, was the ''[[Yongle Dadian]]'' containing a total of 370 million [[Chinese characters]]. The project involved 2,169 scholars, who worked for four years under general editor [[Yao Guangxiao]]. It was completed in 1408, but never printed, as the imperial treasury had run out of money.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=604}}

The ''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (Imperially approved synthesis of books and illustrations past and present) is by far the largest ''leishu'' ever printed, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}} It was compiled by a team of scholars led by [[Chen Menglei]], and printed between 1726 and 1728, during the Qing dynasty.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=605}}

The ''riyong leishu'' (encyclopedias for daily use), containing practical information for people who were literate but below the [[Confucian]] elite, were also compiled in the later imperial era. Today, they provide scholars with valuable information on non-elite culture and attitudes.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

According to [[Jean-Pierre Diény]], the [[Jiaqing Emperor|Jiaqing reign]] (1796–1820) of the Qing dynasty saw the end of the publication of ''leishu''.{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==In other countries==
[[File:Sancai Tuhui World Map.jpg|thumb|The world map entitled [[Shanhai Yudi Quantu]], from the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', an illustrated ''leishu'']]

Other countries of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]] also adopted the genre of ''leishu''. In 1712, the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', a richly illustrated ''leishu'' compiled by Ming scholar Wang Qi (王圻) in the early 17th century, was printed in Japan as ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]''. The Japanese version was edited by Terajima Ryōan (寺島良安), a physician born in [[Osaka]].{{sfn|Lehner|2011|p=47}}

==Importance==
The ''leishu'' have played an important role in the preservation of ancient works, many of which have been lost, only preserved completely or partially as part of a ''leishu'' compilation. The 7th-century ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' is especially valuable. It contains excerpts from 1,400 pre-7th century works, 90% of which have been otherwise lost. Even though the ''Yongle Dadian'' is itself largely lost, the remnants still contain 385 complete books that have been otherwise lost.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}} The ''leishu'' also provide a unique view of the transmission of knowledge and education, and an easy way to locate traditional materials on any given subject.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|p=602}}

==Major compilations==
Approximately 600 ''leishu'' were compiled, from the Cao Wei period (early third century) until the 18th century, of which 200 have survived. Among the most important, in chronological order, are:{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp=603–5}}

*''[[Yiwen Leiju]]'' (Collection of literature arranged by categories), compiled by [[Ouyang Xun]]
*''[[Beitang Shuchao]]'' (Excerpts from books in the Northern Hall), compiled by [[Yu Shinan]] ca. 630
*''[[Chuxue Ji]]'' (Writings for elementary instruction), compiled by Xu Jian et al. between 713 and 742
*''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' (''Taiping Imperial Reader''), compiled by [[Li Fang (Song dynasty)|Li Fang]] et al., published 984
*''[[Cefu Yuangui]]'' (Outstanding models from the storehouse of literature), compiled by [[Wang Qinruo]] et al., completed in 1013
*''[[Yuhai]]'' (Ocean of jade), compiled by [[Wang Yinglin]] 1330–40
*''[[Yongle Dadian]]'', completed 1408, the largest ''leishu'' ever compiled
*''[[Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'', 1726–28, the largest ''leishu'' ever printed

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15477">Many early [[Islamic]] [[philosophers]] and [[logician]]s discussed the [[liar paradox]]. Their work on the subject began in the 10th century and continued to [[Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī]] and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] of the middle 13th century&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp97&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp123&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Liar paradox has been well known in [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Latin]] traditions, the works of Arabic scholars have only recently been translated into [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp97/&gt;

Each group of early Islamic philosophers discussed different problems presented by the paradox. They pioneered unique solutions that were not influenced by [[Western philosophy|Western]] ideas.

== Athīr and the Liar paradox ==
Athīr al-Dīn Mufaḍḍal (b. ʿUmar Abharī, d. 663/1264) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[philosopher]], [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] from the city of [[Abhar]] in [[Persia]]. There is some speculation that his works on the Liar paradox could have been known to Western logicians, and in particular to [[Thomas Bradwardine]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp113&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He analyzed the Liar sentence as follows:

{{quotation|One of the difficult [[fallacies]] is the conjunction of the two [[contradiction|contradictories]] (Jamʿal-naqīḍyan) when someone says, “All that I say at this moment is false”. This sentence (qawl) is either true or false. If it is true, then it must be true and false. And if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is necessarily true and false.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt;}}

In other words, Athīr says that if the Liar sentence is false, which means that the Liar falsely declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is true; and, if the Liar sentence is true, which means that the Liar truthfully declares that all he says at the moment is false, then the Liar sentence is false. In any case, the Liar sentence is both true and false at the same time, which is a [[paradox]].&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athīr offers the following solution for the paradox:

{{quotation|To solve the paradox we say: we should not concede that if it is false then one of his sentences (kalām) is true. For its being true is taken to be the [[De Morgan's laws#Negation of a conjunction|conjunction]] of its being true and being false. Therefore its being false necessitates the non-conjunction of its being true and being false. And the non-conjunction of its being true and being false does not necessitate
its being true.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt;}}

According to the traditional idealization&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{Citation

*Other examples of a counter-instance include: it is false to say that all birds could fly because there are some that could not, like for example [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;
*Other examples of an empty subject term include: it is false to say that all [[Magic carpet|flying carpets]] have four corners, and not only because some carpets are round or have three corners, but rather because there are no flying carpets at all.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;

The Liar sentence, however, has neither an empty subject nor counter-instance. This fact creates obstacles for Athīr's view, who must show what is unique about the Liar sentence, and how the Liar sentence still could be only true or false in view of the "true" and "false" conditions set up in the universal proposition's description. Athīr tries to solve the paradox by applying to it the laws of negation of a conjunction and negation of a disjunction.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp108/&gt;

Ahmed Alwishah, who has a Ph.D. in Islamic [[Philosophy]] and David Sanson, who has a Ph.D. in Philosophy explain that Athīr actually claims that:

(1) "It is not the case that, if the Liar Sentence is not both true and false, then it is true."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alwishah and Sanson continue:
"The general principle behind (1) is clear enough: the negation of a conjunction does not [[Logical consequence|entail]] the negation of a conjunct; so from not both true and false you cannot infer not false and so true. Abharī appears to be saying that the Liar rests on an elementary scope fallacy! But, of course, Abharī is not entitled to (1). In some cases, the negation of a conjunction does entail the negation of a conjunct: 'not both P and P' for example, entails 'not P'. As a general rule, the negation of a conjunction entails the negation of each conjunct whenever the conjuncts are logically equivalent, i.e., whenever the one follows from the other and vice verse. So Abharī is entitled to (1) only if he is entitled to assume that ‘The Liar Sentence is true’ and ‘The Liar Sentence is false’ are not logically equivalent."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110/&gt;

The Liar sentence is a universal proposition (The Liar says '''All''' I say ...), so "if it is (non&amp;ndash;[[vacuously]]) false it must have a counter&amp;ndash;instance".&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp110/&gt; But in this case scenario, when the only thing that the liar is saying is the single sentence declaring that what he is saying at the moment is false, the only available counter&amp;ndash;instance is the Liar sentence itself. When staging the paradox Abharī said: "if it is not true, then it is necessary that one of his sentences at this moment is true, as long as he utters something. But, he says nothing at this moment other than this sentence. Thus, this sentence is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] and false"&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp107/&gt; So the explanation provided by Abharī himself demonstrates that both "'The Liar Sentence is false' and 'The Liar Sentence is true' are [[logically equivalent]]. If they are logically equivalent, then, contrary to (1), the negation of the conjunction does entail the negation of each conjunct. Abharī’s 'solution; therefore fails."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp111&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasir al-Din al-Tusi on the Liar paradox==
[[File:Nasir al-Din Tusi.jpg|[[Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]] commemorated on an Iranian stamp on the 700th anniversary of his death|250px|thumb]]

Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī was a [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|title=Tusi, Nasir al-Din al-|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073899|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[polymath]]&lt;ref name=Nasrp199&gt;{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prolific writer: an [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], [[biologist]], [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|chemist]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Islamic physics|physicist]], [[Islamic science|scientist]], [[Kalam|theologian]] and [[Grand Ayatollah|Marja Taqleed]]. He adhered to the [[Ismaili]], and subsequently [[Twelver Shi`ism|Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shī‘ah]] [[Islam]]ic belief systems.&lt;ref name="Ṭūsīp2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ṭūsī|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later [[Persian people|Persian]] scholars.

Ṭūsī's work on the paradox begins with a discussion of the paradox and the solution offered by Abharī, with which Ṭūsī disagrees. As Alwishah and Sanson point out "Ṭūsī argues that whatever fancy thing (conjunction, conditional) Abharī wants to identify as the truth condition for the Liar Sentence, it will not matter, because pace Abharī, we can generate the paradox without inferring, from the negation of a complex truth condition, the negation of one of its parts. We can argue directly that its being false entails the negation of its being false, and so entails its being true."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp114&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ṭūsī then prepares a stage for his own solution of the Liar paradox, writing that:
{{quotation|If a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything, then it is possible that it itself can declare-something-about another declarative sentence.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not see a reason that could prevent a declarative sentence to declare something about another declarative sentence.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt;

With an example of two declarative sentences, (D1) "It is false" and (D2) "Zayd is sitting", Ṭūsī explains how one declarative sentence (D1) can declare another declarative sentence (D2) to be false: "It is false that Zayd is sitting".&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt; There is no paradox in the above two declarative sentences because they have different subjects. To generate a paradox a declarative sentence must declare something about itself. If (D1) falsely declares itself to be not (D1) then this false declaration referencing to itself as being "false" creates a paradox.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp115/&gt;

Ṭūsī writes: {{Quotation|Moreover, if the first declarative sentence declares itself to be false, then [both] its being true, insofar as it is a declarative sentence, and its being false, insofar as it is that-about-which-something-is-declared, are concomitant. Thus, the following paradox can be generated: The first declarative sentence, which is a declaration (khabar) about itself, namely that it is false, is either false or true. If it is true, then it must be false, because it declares itself to be false. If it is false, then it must be true, because if it is said falsely, then it will become true, which is absurd.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The above conclusions are very important to the history of Liar Paradox. Alwishah and Sanson point out: "It is hard to overemphasize how remarkable this passage is. The contemporary reader will be familiar with the idea that the Liar Paradox is a paradox of selfreference. But Ṭūsī is, as far as we know, the first person to express this idea. This passage has no precedent in any tradition. Ṭūsī has performed three remarkable feats in short order. First, his Liar Sentence is singular: its subject is itself, and it declares itself to be false. Gone, then, is the choice between universal or particular Liar Sentence, and the associated problem of adding further assumptions to generate a genuine paradox. Second, he has characterized the paradox as one of [[List of paradoxes#Self-reference|self-reference]]. Third, he has identified a key assumption that might be responsible for generating the entire problem: the assumption that a declarative sentence, by its nature, can declare-something-about anything."&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116/&gt;

Recognizing that, if a [[declarative sentence]] that [[Self-reference|declares itself]] being false, is false, this does not necessitate it being true. Ṭūsī says that it would be absurd to say that this declarative sentence is true only because it is not false.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp116/&gt; Ṭūsī writes:{{Quotation|. . . its being false, insofar as it is a declarative sentence, does not necessitate its being true. Instead, its being false necessitates the denial of its being false, insofar as it is that-about-which-something-is-declared, and [necessitates] its being false, insofar as it is a declarative sentence. Hence, we should not concede that, in this way, the denial of its being false necessitates its being true.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp117&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ṭūsī then interprets the definitions of "true" and "false", in an attempt to prove that those definitions should not be taken into consideration when dealing with a declarative sentence that declares itself, as its own subject, to be false.

Al-Baghdādī's definition of "truth" and "falsity" says that: ''"truth is an agreement with the subject, and falsity is the opposite of that"''. Ṭūsī argues that this definition cannot be applied to a declarative sentence that declares its own subject to be false because then there are at least two opposite parts that are in disagreement with each other. The same subject cannot be in disagreement with itself. Therefore a self&amp;ndash;referenced declarative sentence that declares itself to be false is neither false nor true, and truth/falsity definitions are not applicable to those sentences.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp121&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|the result of a judgment that applies truth and falsity to something to which they in no way apply, and to apply them in any way is the misuse of a predicate.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp121/&gt;}}

Ṭūsī stopped short from offering a solution for the Liar sentences discussed by Āmidī "All that I say at this moment is false". This sentence presents a different case scenario because it can be interpreted as declaring something about itself, and something about another sentence. The solution for this paradox is absent from Ṭūsī's papers.&lt;ref name=A&amp;Sp122&gt;{{Harvnb|Alwishah|Sanson|2009|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge|list of classical abbreviations|date=July 2017}}
This is a '''list of common [[Latin]] [[abbreviation]]s'''. Nearly all the abbreviations below have been adopted by [[Modern English]].  However, with some exceptions (for example, ''versus'' or ''[[modus operandi]]''), most of the Latin referent words and phrases are perceived as foreign to English.  In a few cases, English referents have replaced the original Latin ones (e.g., "[[rest in peace]]" for RIP and "post script" for PS).

[[Latin]] was once the universal academic language in Europe. From the 18th century authors started using their mother tongues to write books, papers or proceedings. Even when Latin fell out of use, many Latin abbreviations continued to be used due to their precise simplicity and Latin's status as a learnèd language.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In July 2016, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] announced that its websites would no longer use Latin abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/20/changes-to-the-style-guide-no-more-eg-and-ie-etc/|title=Changes to the style guide: no more eg, and ie, etc|accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of common abbreviations==
All abbreviations are given with [[full stops]], although these are omitted or included as a personal preference in most situations.

||{{Anchor|ceteris paribus}}Cp||''[[ceteris paribus]]''||"all other things being equal"||Commonly used in economics, ceteris paribus allows for supply and demand models to reflect specific variables. If one assumes that the only thing changing is, say, the price of wheat, then demand and supply will both be affected appropriately. While this is simplification of actual dynamic market models, it makes learning economic theory easier.

The exact usage of the term varies between British English and American English. The singular form is never vita. Curriculum is already singular, vitae is genitive from "vita", i.e. "of life", despite the plural-appearing vitae modifier. The true plural is curricula vitae.

|Example: ''These results agree with the ones published by Pelon et al. (2002).''
"Etc." should not be used for people.
|-
|{{Anchor|et cetera}}[[etc.]]||''[[et caetera]]''||"and the others", "and other things", "and the rest".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;
| Other archaic abbreviations include "&amp;c.", "&amp;/c.", "&amp;e.", "&amp;ct.", and "&amp;ca."
&lt;p&gt;Example: ''I need to go to the store and buy some pie, milk, cheese, '''etc.'''''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because ''cetera'' implies inanimate objects, ''et al.'' is preferred when speaking of people.&lt;/p&gt;

|-
|{{Anchor|ibidem}}[[ibid.]]||''[[ibidem]]''||"in the same place (book, etc.)"&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;||The abbreviation is used in citations. It should not be confused with the following abbreviation.
|-
|{{Anchor|idem}}[[id.]]||''[[idem]]''||"the same (man)".&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;||It is used to avoid repeating the name of a male author (in citations, footnotes, bibliographies, etc.) When quoting a female author, use the corresponding feminine form, [[ead.]] (''[[eadem]]''), "the same (woman)" (''eadem'' is pronounced with stress on the first ''e-'').
|-
|{{Anchor|inter alia}}[[i.a.]]||''[[inter alia]]''||"among other things".

|{{Anchor|Legum Baccalaureus}}[[LL.B.]] or Ll.B.||''[[Legum Baccalaureus]]''||"bachelor of laws"||The "LL." of the abbreviation for the degree is from the genitive plural ''legum'' (singular: ''lex'' or ''legis'', for law), thus "LL.B." stands for Legum Baccalaureus in Latin. In the United States it was sometimes erroneously called "Bachelor of Legal Letters" to account for the double "L" (and therefore sometimes abbreviated as "L.L.B.").
|-

|-
|{{Anchor|pro re nata}}[[Pro re nata|PRN]]||''[[pro re nata]]''||"before a thing is born"||"As used in standard medical jargon, PRN is understood to mean 'as needed'. This reading of the abbreviation implies that the delivery of the prescription (by a suitable person, following medications protocol) is done in a reactive, passive way. eg WHEN THAT HAPPENS, DO THIS. A more literal translation of the Latin is 'before a thing is born', which is an instruction to act pro-actively: eg BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, DO THIS . A prn medication delivery therefore properly done when a medic JUDGES that it should be done, in order to prevent a specified problem from occurring. Oversimplifying, a patient's breakfast could be written as a prn prescription: give this breakfast to that patient, to prevent that patient from experiencing hunger.||Used in [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s

|{{Anchor|in re}}Re||''[[in re]]''||"in the matter of", "concerning"||Often used to prefix the subject of traditional [[Letter (message)|letters]] and [[memoranda]].

|{{Anchor|videlicet}}[[viz.]]||''[[videlicet]]''||"namely", "to wit", "precisely", "that is to say"&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt;||In contradistinction to "i.e." and "e.g.", "viz." is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.
&lt;br/&gt;Example: ''The noble gases, '''viz.''' helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton and radon, show a non-expected behaviour when exposed to this new element.''

&lt;br/&gt;Example: ''The next football game will be the Knights '''vs.''' the Sea Eagles.'' In English law the ''v'' has no full stop (period) and is ''never'' ''vs'' and is never pronounced ''versus'' but rather as ''and'' Example: ''R(egina) v Gadd'' (a criminal case) which is pronounced as ''The Crown and Gadd.'' Similarly the film ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' is in England (at least to a lawyer): ''Kramer and Kramer'' although it would be written ''Kramer v Kramer.'' In Scots Law, the ''v'' is pronounced ''against.''  For example, ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' is pronounced ''Donoghue against Stevenson.''

==Less common abbreviations and usages== 
Words and abbreviations that have been in general use, but are currently used less often:
* a.C.n. = [[ante Christum natum]] = [[Anno Domini|BC]] = before Christ
* ad. nat. delt. = ad naturam delineavit = he/she drew (this artwork) after nature
* AMDG (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'' or ''[[ad majorem Dei gloriam]]''): Latin - "For the greater glory of God". It is the [[motto]] of the [[Society of Jesus]].

* a.U.c. (''[[ab Urbe condita]]'' or ''Anno Urbis conditae''): Latin for "from the foundation of [[Rome|the City]]":&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt; it refers to the [[founding of Rome]], which occurred in [[750s BC|753 BC]] according to [[Livy]]'s count. Used as a reference point in ancient Rome for establishing dates, before being supplanted by other systems. Also ''anno Urbis conditae'' (a.U.c.) ("in the year that the City [Rome] was founded"). For example, the year 2007 [[AD]] is the year 2761 ''ab Urbe condita'' (753 + 1 + 2007 = 2761); though, rigorously speaking, the year ''a.U.c.'' begins on April 21, the ''[[birthday of Rome]]'' (i.e. the day that [[Romulus]] was traditionally believed to have founded the Eternal City).  (The reason for adding 1 to 753 is that the Romans counted dates "inclusively," i.e., including both the first and the last day or year in the count.)

The '''Museum of Comparative Zoology''', full name "The Louis Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology", often abbreviated simply to "MCZ", is the [[zoology]] museum located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]]. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum.  The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is [[James Hanken]], the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.

Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a [[fossil]] [[sand dollar]] which was found by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834, Captain Cook's [[mamo]], and two [[pheasant]]s that once belonged to [[George Washington]], now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.

==History==
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor, Mary P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6vLeToUzHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reading+the+shape+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qvSLpLfZAhWFPN8KHUbnBN4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reading%20the%20shape%20of%20nature&amp;f=false Reading the Shape of Nature: Comparative Zoology at the Agassiz Museum] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and [[Comparative anatomy|comparative relationships]] of [[animal]] life.

The [[Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory]] was created in 1894 when [[Radcliffe College]] rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/1468-0424.12292/abstract|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12292/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.

==Departments==
The museum comprises twelve departments: [[Biological Oceanography]], [[Entomology]], [[Herpetology]], [[Ichthyology]], [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate zoology|Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammalogy]], [[Marine invertebrates]], [[Malacology]], [[Ornithology]], [[Population Genetics]], and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]].  The [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr Library]] and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum.  The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org Biodiversity Heritage Library].

==Publications==
The museum publishes two journals: the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College'', first published in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/2803|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Breviora'', first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breviora|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3989|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Notable exhibits include [[whale]] [[skeleton]]s, the largest [[turtle]] [[Animal shell|shell]] ever found (eight feet long), "the Harvard [[mastodon]]", a {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} long ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' skeleton, the skeleton of a [[dodo]], and a [[coelacanth]] preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

New and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include "Evolution" (2008); "The Language of Color" (2008 to 2013); "Arthropods: Creatures that Rule" (2006); "New England Forests" (2011); and "Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm" (2012).

'''''The Observer's Books''''' were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items.&lt;ref name=OPSCS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the books|url=http://www.observersbooksociety.co.uk/about_books.html|publisher=OPSCS|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Barry|title=To Have Borne Witness: Memories and Observations Regarding Human Population and Species Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-0310-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.  

The books were produced with paper [[dust jacket|dust covers]] up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as "Glossies". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.

The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.

In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on "airplanes" {{sic}}. This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. 

The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like ''Aircraft'', ''Automobiles'' and ''Railway Locomotives'' proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. 

When Warne was acquired by [[Penguin Books|Penguin books]] in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).

After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled ''Observer's Book of Observer's Books'' in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of ''Wayside and Woodland'' in 2003.

In the study of [[history]] as an academic discipline, a '''primary source''' (also called an '''original source''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], document, diary, [[manuscript]], [[autobiography]], recording, or any other source of [[information]] that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in [[library science]], and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In [[journalism]], a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalism: Primary Sources|url=http://infoguides.pepperdine.edu/c.php?g=287355&amp;p=1915752|publisher=Pepperdine University|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources are distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726061349/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland. &lt;/ref&gt; A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. "Primary" and "secondary" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;{{rp|118–246}}&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 |quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one. Since a source is only a source in a specific historical context, the same source object can be both a primary or secondary source according to what it is used for.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of source classification==

===History===

[[File:donfelipe.jpg|thumb|360px|right|From a letter of Philip II, King of Spain, 16th century]]
In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Between Two Cultures:An Introduction to Economic History|page=27|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co.|year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sreedharan believes that primary sources have the most direct connection to the past and that they "speak for themselves" in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sreedharan|first=E.|title=A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000|year=2004|publisher=Orient Longman|isbn=81-250-2657-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIGq85RVvdoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=302|quote=[I]t is through the primary sources that the past indisputably imposes its reality on the historian. That this imposition is basic in any understanding of the past is clear from the rules that documents should not be altered, or that any material damaging to a historian's argument or purpose should not be left out or suppressed. These rules mean that the sources or the texts of the past have an integrity and that they do indeed 'speak for themselves', and that they are necessary constraints through which past reality imposes itself on the historian.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Though the terms ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' originated in [[historiography]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In [[scientific literature]], a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In [[political history]], primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the [[history of ideas]] or [[intellectual history]], the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In [[religious history]], the primary sources are [[religious texts]] and descriptions of religious [[ceremonies]] and [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/content.php?pid=60919&amp;sid=447878|title=Primary Sources - Religion|website=Research Guides at Tufts University|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[cultural history]] could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Howell | first1 = Martha C. | last2 = Prevenier | first2 = Walter. | title = From reliable sources : an introduction to historical method | year = 2001 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn = 0-8014-8560-6 | pages =20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Narrative]] sources''' or '''literary sources''' tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include [[diary|diaries]], films, biographies, leading philosophical works and [[scientific works]].
*'''Diplomatic sources''' include [[charter]]s and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
*'''Social documents''' are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cripps |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Historical Truth: An Interview with Ken Burns |journal=American Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=741–764 |doi=10.2307/2168603 |jstor= 2168603|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 100, No. 3 |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.&lt;br&gt;
*In the [[humanities]], a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
*In the [[social sciences]], the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
*In the [[natural sciences]], a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions "Primary Sources: what are they?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208191118/http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions |date=8 February 2009 }}. Lafayette College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in [[archives]], [[libraries]], [[museum]]s, [[historical societies]], and [[special collections]]. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the [[Huntington Library]] in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The [[Library of Congress]] maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are [http://www.memory.loc.gov American Memory] and [[Chronicling America]]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also has digital collections in [http://digitalvaults.org/ Digital Vaults]. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The [[Internet Archive]] also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, [[Europeana]] has digitized materials from across Europe while the [[World Digital Library]] and [[Flickr Commons]] have items from all over the world. [[Trove]] has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or [[finding aid]]. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as [[WorldCat]], the [https://catalog2.loc.gov/ Library of Congress catalog], the [https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/ National Archives catalog], and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. [[Arthur Marwick]] says "Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history."&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;Marwick, Arthur. "Primary Sources: Handle with Care". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-46580-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be [[memoir]]s, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in [[classical studies]], where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. "Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret."&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

The following questions are asked about primary sources:
* What is the tone?
* Who is the intended audience?
* What is the purpose of the publication?
* What assumptions does the author make?
* What are the bases of the author's conclusions?
* Does the author agree or disagree with other authors of the subject?
* Does the content agree with what you know or have learned about the issue?
* Where was the source made? (questions of [[systemic bias]])

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla/&gt; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Taking Stock of Research Methods and Analysis on Oppositional Political Terrorism|journal=The American Sociologist|volume=35|issue=2|year=2004|pages=26–37|doi=10.1007/BF02692395|quote=The analysis of secondary source information is problematic. The further an investigator is from the primary source, the more distorted the information may be. Again, each new person may put his or her spin on the findings.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text="A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than primary sources or secondary sources actually based on primary sources, is by definition [[fiction]] and not history at all."|sign=Kameron Searle|}}

However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be [[bias]] and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.
{{quote|"Original material may be... prejudiced, or at least not exactly what it claims to be."|David Iredale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Iredale | first1 = David | title = Enjoying archives: what they are, where to find them, how to use them | year = 1973 | publisher = Newton Abbot, David and Charles, | isbn = 0-7153-5669-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to [[peer review]], can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectiveness]] of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a [[Diary|journal]] entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's [[opinion]] on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and [[witness|eyewitness]]es may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, ''The Oral History Manual'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, " Analysis of Primary Sources" [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/psources/analyze.html online 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be [[censorship|censored]] or altered for propaganda or [[cover-up]] purposes. The facts can be [[distortion|distorted]] to present the opposing sides in a negative light. [[Barrister]]s are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton| first1=Margaret Stieg|last2=Charnigo|first2=Laurie|title=Historians and Their Information Sources|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|page=419| doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.400|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/400.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 January 2017}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delgadillo|first1=Roberto|last2=Lynch|first2=Beverly|title=Future Historians: Their Quest for Information|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/60/3/245.full.pdf+html|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=May 1999|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=245–259, at 253|quote=[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing.|ref=harv}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary&lt;ref name=Duffin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name=Duffin/&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Ethnohistory, Vol. 33, No. 3|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the "primary source" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ambraseys|first1=Nicholas|last2=Melville|first2=Charles Peter|last3=Adams|first3=Robin Dartrey|title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia, and the Red Sea|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtVqdSKnBq4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=7|quote=The same chronicle can be a primary source for the period contemporary with the author, a secondary source for earlier material derived from previous works, but also a primary source when these earlier works have not survived|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called [[diplomatics]].

For centuries, [[Pope]]s used the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false [[Anglo-Saxon charters]], a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]], who placed false [[monumental brass]]es in a [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] "authenticated" the [[Hitler Diaries]], which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|UK National Archives]] in the hope of establishing a false [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to record class R4|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leppard| first=David|title=Forgeries revealed in the National Archives – Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3867853.ece|work=The Sunday Times|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.&lt;ref name=Handlin&gt;[[Oscar Handlin]] and [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–25}}

The '''reference desk''' or '''information desk''' of a library is a public service counter where professional [[librarian]]s provide library users with direction to library materials, advice on library collections and services, and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.

==Purpose and usage==
Library users can consult the staff at the reference desk for help in finding information.  Using a structured [[reference interview]], the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them.&lt;ref name="reference desk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miles|first1=Dennis B.|title=Shall We Get Rid Of The Reference Desk?|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly|date=2013|volume=52|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosby|first1=Olivia|title=Librarians: Information Experts in the Information Age|url=http://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2000/Winter/art01.pdf|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.

The ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a [[book]] or [[Academic journal|journal]] article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library's online [[library catalog|catalog]] or subscription [[bibliographic database|bibliographic/fulltext database]]s, or simply factual information drawn from the library's print or online [[reference work|reference collection]].  Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources.&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians" /&gt; Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions.  A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.

The services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff.

==History==
Reference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Liya|title=The Evolution of Library Reference Services: From General to Special, 1876-1920's|journal=Libri: International Journal of Libraries &amp; Information Services|date=September 2014|volume=64|issue=3|pages=254–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt; Beginning in 1883 with the [[Boston Public Library]], libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt;

One of the earliest proponents of references services was [[Samuel Swett Green]]. He wrote an article titled "Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers" which had a large impact on the future of reference services.&lt;ref name="Evolution of Library Reference" /&gt;
then, it operated to incorporate ... making the following variables relevant in offering reference services: the user's query; the reference librarian; and, the reference sources. Until hitherto the communication between the reference librarian and the user are through direct contact. Hence, Utor (2008), defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information. That is during the traditional era. towards the later decades of 19th century, however, reference and information services witnessed an insidious yet drastic paradigm-shift following the incorporation of information communication technology in reference services (and in library operations, by extension). Thus leading to an entirely new era, otherwise known as digital era with different information technologies coming in to aid the work of a reference librarian; changing information sources, reference processes and communication medium.

==Resources==
Resources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:
* A computer with internet access. Librarians use both the public web and subscription databases to find and evaluate information and research sources. 
* A small collection of [[reference work|reference book]]s (called ''ready reference'') that are most often used, so that the librarians can reach them quickly, especially when they are on the phone, and so that the books will be returned in time for someone else to use later the same day. The library's full reference collection is usually nearby as well.
* Newspaper clipping files and other rare or restricted items that must be returned to the reference desk.
* Index cards with the answers to frequently asked questions, and/or drawers with folders of pamphlets and photocopies of pages that, from previous experience, were difficult to find.  These enable librarians to find such information quickly without leaving the desk—even faster than they could look it up in a reference book or using the Internet.
* Books and other items that are being held for library users who asked the librarian by phone to set them aside for them to pick up later the same day, or within the next few days.
* Books from the circulating collection that have been set aside for students working on a special assignment, and are temporarily designated to be used only within the library until the project is due.
* Printed lists of items in the library that are not in the catalogue, such as newspapers, school yearbooks, old telephone directories, college course catalogues, and local history sources.

==Services==
Services that are often available at a library reference desk include:
* A sign up sheet for reserving computers with Internet access, or [[Word processor|word processing]] software.
* The ability to place the book 'on hold', which prevents the person who has borrowed it from renewing it.  The person who placed the 'hold' is notified when the book has been returned. (Some libraries provide this service at the [[Library circulation|circulation]] desk.)
* The ability to request [[interlibrary loan]] of books and other material from other branch libraries in the same library system, or from a cooperating library anywhere in the world. (Some libraries provide this service at the circulation desk.)
* The opportunity to recommend that the library purchase something for its collection that it doesn't have, which may be needed or of interest to other library users.

The [[librarian]] who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:
* The librarian can look up a brief, factual answer to a specific question.
* The librarian can use the catalogue to find out whether the library owns an item with a particular title or author, or that contains a short story, chapter, song, or poem with a particular title, or to compile a list of books by a particular author or on a particular subject.
* The librarian can briefly teach the user how to use the catalogue and how to use its advanced features, or recommend the proper subject words or terms that are used in the catalogue for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can often take the library user directly to the shelves with books on a certain topic without using the catalogue.
* The librarian is familiar with the contents of hundreds of [[reference work|reference book]]s, and can recommend books that might contain the answer to a particular question.
* The librarian can teach the library user to use online [[database]]s such as [[magazine]] and [[newspaper]] articles, and recommend words and search strategies for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can recommend reliable [[Website|web sites]], give advice on searching the Internet for information, and evaluate the reliability of the information on web sites.
* If the library doesn't have information on a given topic, or if the library user wants more information, the librarian can refer the library user to another library or to an organization that can be contacted by phone or mail.
*Offer aid with devices such as tablets and e-readers.  This can range from general assistance with questions on how to navigate e-reader and tablet devices to instructing classes.  Questions can vary from what devices are compatible with the library's e-book platform, how to check out books, and how to read electronic books.

==Staff qualifications==
In the [[United States]], those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master's degree in library science&lt;ref name="BLS Librarians" /&gt; from a program accredited by the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="librarian education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Librarians: How to Become a Librarian|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/librarians.htm#tab-4|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor's degree in library science may perform these duties. In many academic libraries, student assistants are used as the primary contact, sometimes at an "information desk."

In [[Sri Lanka]], librarians at reference desks typically have master's degrees from the Sri Lankan Library Association's accredited programs.

==Electronic reference services==
With the development of the Web, [[Digital Reference Services|digital reference services]] are beginning to take over some of the roles of the traditional reference desk in a library. There is disagreement over whether or not this development is desirable or inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i33/33a03701.htm  Are Reference Desks Dying Out?] by Scott Carlson, ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' April 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reference work''' is a [[book]] or [[periodical literature|periodical]] (or [[electronic publishing|its electronic equivalent]]) to which one can refer for [[information]]. The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually ''referred'' to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. [[index (publishing)|Indices]] are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated [[edition (book)|edition]]s are usually published as needed, in some cases [[annual publication|annually]] (e.g. ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', ''[[Who's Who]]''). Reference works include [[dictionary|dictionaries]], [[thesaurus]]es, [[encyclopedia]]s, [[almanac]]s, [[bibliography|bibliographies]], and [[Library catalog|catalogs]] (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists).&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Santo Tomas Miguel de Benavides Library|title=The Reference Materials|url=http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|accessdate=3 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507153507/http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as [[application software]], [[CD-ROM]]s, [[DVD]]s, or online through the [[Internet]].

A reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of [[trust (emotion)|trust]].

==Reference book==
In comparison, a '''reference book''' or reference-only book in a [[library]] is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping reference books in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from [[library circulation|circulating]] items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.

==Electronic resources==
An electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AllWords.com|title=Electronic Resources|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-electronic+resource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries offer numerous types of electronic resources, such as subject research guides, indices, electronic books and texts, electronic journals, library catalogs, reference sources, statistical sources, sound recordings, and image databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Chicago Library|title=Types of Electronic Resources|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/net/types.html|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SDS-PAGE''' ('''sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis''') is a variant of [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], an analytical method in biochemistry for the separation of charged molecules in mixtures by their [[molecular mass]]es in an [[electric field]]. It uses [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate [[protein]] molecules.

SDS-PAGE is a [[Discontinuous electrophoresis|discontinuous electrophoretic system]] developed by [[Ulrich K. Laemmli]] which is commonly used as a method to separate [[protein]]s with molecular masses between 5 and 250 [[Kilodalton|KDa]].&lt;ref name="Laemmli1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laemmli|first1=U.

== Properties ==
[[File:Protein-SDS interaction.png|thumb|Unfolding of a protein with SDS]]
[[File:Process of Denaturation.svg|thumb|Unfolding of a protein with heat]]
SDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS ([[sodium dodecyl sulfate]]) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein,&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reynolds JA, [[Charles Tanford]] | title=Binding of dodecyl sulfate to proteins at high binding ratios.

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.

SDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules ([[monomer]]) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules.&lt;ref name="TurroYekta1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turro|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Yekta|first2=Ahmad|title=Luminescent probes for detergent solutions.

Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent [[cross-link]]ing and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the [[chemical equilibrium]] of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against [[protease]]s and an increased [[biological half-life]].&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Manning M, Colón W| title=Structural basis of protein kinetic stability: resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests a central role for rigidity and a bias toward beta-sheet structure. | journal=Biochemistry | year= 2004 | volume= 43 | issue= 35 | pages= 11248–54 | pmid=15366934 | doi=10.1021/bi0491898 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15366934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or [[western blot]]ting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.

=== Gel production ===
[[File:Electrophoresis gel combs 2.jpg|thumb|Sample combs with different numbers of pockets, each prong leaves a pocket in the gel when pulled out]]
[[File:Acrylamidgel.JPG|thumb|Polymerised separating and stacking gel before removing the sample comb (white) between the spacers (black), in the stacking gel are small amounts of bromophenol blue for improved visibility, the separating gel is unstained]]
When using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the [[diffusion]] does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.

By using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Margolis J, Kenrick KG| title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056–7 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=5774398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris–glycine and neutral pH Bis–Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237–245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiltfangArold1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352–366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer ([[continuous gel electrophoresis]]) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt; Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes.&lt;ref name="MoebiusDenker2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moebius|first1=Jan|last2=Denker|first2=Katrin|last3=Sickmann|first3=Albert|title=Ruthenium (II) tris-bathophenanthroline disulfonate is well suitable for Tris-Glycine PAGE but not for Bis-Tris gels|journal=Proteomics|volume=7|issue=4|year=2007|pages=524–527|issn=1615-9853|doi=10.1002/pmic.200600642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using [[MES (buffer)|MES]] or [[MOPS]] in the running buffer.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt;

=== Sample preparation ===
[[File:Disulfide reduction by DTT-2.png|thumb|Disulfide reduction by DTT]]
During sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95&amp;nbsp;°C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing [[thiol]]s such as [[β-mercaptoethanol]] (β-ME, 5% by volume), [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT, 10 millimolar) or [[dithioerythritol]] (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.

In addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian M. Rosenberg|title=Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gi-UgCF8G6EC&amp;pg=PA103|date=22 December 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4412-3|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.

=== Electrophoresis ===
[[File:Gelelektrophoreseapparatur.jpg|thumb|Electrophoresis chamber after a few minutes of electrophoresis. In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]
For separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.

The fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.

The most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.&lt;ref name="Schäggervon Jagow1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schägger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368–379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Protein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. [[Glycoprotein]]s have differential levels of [[glycosylations]] and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands.&lt;ref name="Cryo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryo-EM Part A: Sample Preparation and Data Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1mPepNTgxcC&amp;pg=PA28|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-095695-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Membrane protein]]s, because of their [[transmembrane domain]], are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower [[solubility]] in aqueous solutions, tend to bind [[lipid]]s, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to [[hydrophobic effect]]s when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in "tailing" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color ("smear") below a band.&lt;ref name="BurgessDeutscher2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P. Deutscher|title=Guide to Protein Purification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6Lp4yna4hoC&amp;pg=PA184|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092317-8|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a [[gel extraction]] can be performed.

=== Archiving ===
[[File:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|Two SDS gels after completed separation of the samples and staining in a drying frame]]
After protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Molecular mass determination ==
[[File:LogM over Rf.png|thumb|The proteins of the size marker (black X) show an approximately straight line in the representation of log M over Rf. The molecular weight of the unknown protein (red X) can be determined on the y-axis.]]
For a more accurate determination of the molecular weight, the relative migration distances of the individual protein bands are measured in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="BonnerHargreaves2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip L.R. Bonner|author2=Alan J. Hargreaves|title=Basic Bioscience Laboratory Techniques: A Pocket Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pavxt_jKi80C&amp;pg=PT140|date=24 August 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-95644-0|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holtzhauer2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Holtzhauer|title=Basic Methods for the Biochemical Lab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lymxOH6cGCoC&amp;pg=PA243|date=13 September 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-32786-8|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements are usually performed in triplicate for increased accuracy. The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility. Bands of proteins with glycosylations can be blurred.&lt;ref name="Cryo"/&gt; Proteins with many basic amino acids (e. g. [[histone]]s)&lt;ref name="VenrooijMaini2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.J. van Venrooij|author2=Ravinder N. Maini|title=Manual of Biological Markers of Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ngrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-011-1670-1|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to an overestimation of the molecular weight or even not migrate into the gel at all, because they move slower in the electrophoresis due to the positive charges or even to the opposite direction. Accordingly, many acidic amino acids can lead to accelerated migration of a protein and an underestimation of its molecular mass.&lt;ref name="GuanZhu2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guan|first1=Yihong|last2=Zhu|first2=Qinfang|last3=Huang|first3=Delai|last4=Zhao|first4=Shuyi|last5=Jan Lo|first5=Li|last6=Peng|first6=Jinrong|title=An equation to estimate the difference between theoretically predicted and SDS PAGE-displayed molecular weights for an acidic peptide|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|year=2015|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep13370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.

Additionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).

In [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].

In medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].

== Variants ==
SDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].

== Alternatives ==
While being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].&lt;ref name="Janson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]&lt;ref name="Desai2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed A. Desai|title=Downstream Processing of Proteins: Methods and Protocols|url=|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-027-8|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[ultrafiltration]].&lt;ref name="Raja2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghosh Raja|title=Protein Bioseparation Using Ultrafiltration: Theory, Applications And New Developments|url=|date=11 June 2003|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-78326-126-0|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a [[pull-down assay]]. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of [[Extraction (chemistry)|extractions]] and [[precipitation]]s using [[kosmotropic]] molecules, for example the [[ammonium sulfate precipitation]] and the [[polyethyleneglycol]] precipitation.

== History ==
In 1948, [[Arne Tiselius]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field.&lt;ref name="Pederson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pederson|first1=T.|title=Turning a PAGE: the overnight sensation of SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis|journal=The FASEB Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2007|pages=949–953|issn=0892-6638|doi=10.1096/fj.08-0402ufm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a [[zone electrophoresis]] improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, L., Davis, B. J.: ''Disc Electrophoresis –1. Background and Theory.'' In: ''Ann NY Acad Sci.'' 121, 1964, pp. 321–349.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by [[David F. Summers]] in the working group of [[James E. Darnell]] to separate poliovirus proteins.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Summers DF, Maizel JV, Darnell JE| title=Evidence for virus-specific noncapsid proteins in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 1965 | volume= 54 | issue= 2 | pages= 505–13 | pmid=4285933 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.54.2.505| pmc=219696 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=4285933}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli and initially used to characterise the proteins in the head of [[bacteriophage T4]].&lt;ref name="Laemmli1970"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Note to anyone who is thinking of making this article self referential: Please do not do this, see the note at top of the recursion article for why --&gt;{{Selfref|For the self-reference template on Wikipedia, see [[Template:Selfref]].}}

[[Image:ouroboros.png|thumb|The [[Ouroboros]], a dragon that continually consumes itself, is used as a symbol for self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soto-Andrade |first1=Jorge |last2=Jaramillo |first2=Sebastian |last3=Gutierrez |first3=Claudio |last4=Letelier |first4=Juan-Carlos |title=Ouroboros avatars: A mathematical exploration of Self-reference and Metabolic Closure |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/alife/0262297140chap115.pdf |publisher=MIT Press |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Self-reference''' occurs in [[natural language|natural]] or [[formal language|formal languages]] when a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], idea or [[formula]] refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some [[Semantics encoding|encoding]]. In [[philosophy]], it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, [[I (pronoun)|the word "I"]] in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[computer programming]], and [[linguistics]]. Self-referential statements are sometimes [[paradox]]ical, and can also be considered [[Recursion|recursive]].

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical [[philosophy]], [[paradoxes]] were created by self-referential concepts such as the [[omnipotence paradox]] of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The [[Epimenides paradox]], 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computability theory]], self-reference (also known as [[Impredicativity]]) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. [[The halting problem]] equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]], and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In [[game theory]] undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In [[computer programming]], self-reference occurs in [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]], where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenfant|first1=J.|last2=Demers|first2=F-N|title=A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation|url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/malenfant.pdf|publisher=PARC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in [[recursion]] (related to the mathematical [[recurrence relation]]) in [[functional programming]], where a code structure refers back to itself during computation.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker |first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of [[computer science]], and is now used routinely in, for example, writing [[compilers]] using the 'meta-language' [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as [[bootstrapping]]. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with [[Assembly language|assembler]] and with functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as [[GNU]] ('Gnu's not Unix') and [[PINE]] ('Pine is not Elm'). The [[GNU Hurd]] is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

[[Tupper's self-referential formula]] is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

== In life ==
The biology of [[self-replication]] is self-referential, as embodied by [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational [[Game of life]], and have inspired engineering systems such as the [[RepRap]] self-replicating 3d printer.

== In art ==
Self-reference occurs in [[literature]] and [[film]] when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'', [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', many stories by [[Nikolai Gogol]], ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'' by [[John Barth]], [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''. Perhaps the earliest example is in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], where [[Helen of Troy]] laments: "for generations still unborn/we will live in song" (appearing in the song itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |others=Translated by Robert Fagles |title=Iliad |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=1-101-15281-8 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and [[meta-reference]], which often involve self-reference. The short stories of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Krapp's Last Tape]] consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the [[rubber reality]] movement, notably in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s films [[Being John Malkovich]] and [[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]], the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.

Various [[creation myths]] invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the [[Egyptian creation myth]] has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. [[Ouroboros]] is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The [[surrealist]] painter [[René Magritte]] is famous for his self-referential works. His painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', includes the words "this is not a pipe", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word ''ceci'' (in English, "this") refers to the pipe depicted&amp;mdash;or to the painting or the word or sentence itself.&lt;ref name="NöthBishara2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |last2=Bishara |first2=Nina |title=Self-reference in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBOFIdchEQYC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2007 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019464-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.C. Escher]]'s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

== In language ==
A word that describes itself is called an ''[[autological word]]'' (or ''[[autological word|autonym]]''). This generally applies to adjectives, for example [[wikt:sesquipedalian|sesquipedalian]] (i.e. "sesquipedalian" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as [[wikt:TLA|TLA]], as a three-letter [[abbreviation]] for "[[three-letter abbreviation]]".

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an [[autogram]].

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. "This is a sentence." can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However "This sentence is false" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential [[Liar paradox|paradox]]. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. [[Kurt Gödel]] claimed to have found such a paradox in the [[US constitution]] at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the [[Broadcast media|media]] when it is required to write about itself, for example the [[BBC]] reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as [[Wikipedia]]'s article on Wikipedia.

[[Fumblerules]] are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as "Avoid cliches like the plague" and "Don't use no double negatives". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html alt.usage.english.org's ''Humorous Rules for Writing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = William |last= Safire |authorlink=William Safire |publication-date=1979-11-04 |title=On Language; The Fumblerules of Grammar |periodical=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/on-language-the-fumblerules-of-grammar.html?sq=Fumblerules&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |page=SM4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In meta-disciplines ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Several academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example [[historiography]] (or "[[meta-history]]") is history's study of its own past; [[meta-sociology]] occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and [[meta-mathematics]] is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In [[law]], self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around [[constitutional]] issues. (The game of [[nomic]] begins as a model of this process.) The prefix "[[meta]]" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.

==In popular culture==
* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s books, especially ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' and ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. [[Hofstadter's law]], which specifies that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a 'Reviews of this book', a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using [[wiki|wikis]] and other technologies. Hofstadter's '[[strange loop]]' [[metaphysics]] attempts to map [[consciousness]] onto self-reference, but is a minority position in [[philosophy of mind]].
* The subgenre of "[[recursion|recursive]] [[science fiction]]" or [[metafiction]] is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the [[New England Science Fiction Association]]'s website; some of it is about [[science-fiction fandom]], some about science fiction and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/Recursion/index.htm "Recursive Science Fiction"] New England Science Fiction Association website, last updated 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35327">'''Source criticism''' (or '''information evaluation''') is the process of evaluating an [[information source]], i.e. a document, a person, a speech, a fingerprint, a photo, an observation, or anything used in order to obtain knowledge. In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid,  reliable or relevant. Broadly, "source criticism" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.

== Meaning ==

Problems in translation: The Danish word "kildekritik" like the Norwegian word "kildekritikk" and the Swedish word "källkritik" derived from the German "Quellenkritik" and is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886). Hardtwig writes: "His [Ranke's] first work ''Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen Völker'' von 1494&amp;ndash;1514 (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, ''Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber'' (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of [[textual criticism]] used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing" (Hardtwig, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12739).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries would be dominated by the research-oriented
conception of historical method of the so-called
Historical School in Germany, led by historians as
Leopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception
of history, long been regarded as the beginning
of modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the
'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the
methodical character of history to source criticism" (Lorenz, 2001).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bible studies dominate the use of "source criticism" in America (cf. Hjørland, 2008). The term is thus relatively seldom used in English about [[historical method]]s and [[historiography]] (cf. Hjørland, 2008). This difference between European and American use of "source criticism" is somewhat strange considering the influence of Ranke on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been suggested that differences in the use of the term are not accidental but due to different views of the historical method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the German/Scandinavian tradition this subject is seen as important, whereas in the Anglo-American tradition it is believed that historical methods must be specific and associated with the subject studied, for which reason there is no general field of "source criticism"{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

In the Scandinavian countries and elsewhere source evaluation (or information evaluation) is also studied interdisciplinarily from many different points of view, partly caused by the influence of the Internet. It is a growing field in, among other fields, [[library and information science]]. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2012). Methods for evaluating information sources: An annotated catalogue. Journal of information science. 38(3), 258-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balin, A. &amp; Grafstein, A. (2010). The critical assessment of research: Traditional and new methods of evaluation. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, Olden-Jørgensen (1998) and Thurén (1997) written by historians:
* Human sources may be relics (e.g. a fingerprint) or narratives (e.g. a statement or a letter). Relics are more credible sources than narratives.
*  A given source may be forged or corrupted; strong indications of the originality of the source increases its reliability.
*  The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened
* A [[primary source]] is more reliable than a [[secondary source]], which in turn is more reliable than a [[tertiary source]] and so on.
*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.
* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.
*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness (or source) has no direct interest in creating bias, the credibility of the message is increased.

We may add the following principles:
* Knowledge of source criticism cannot substitute subject knowledge:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The reliability of a given source is relative to the questions put to it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand" (Savolainen, 2007).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):

#How was the source located?
#What type of source is it?
#Who is the author and what are the qualifications of the author in regard to the topic that is discussed?
#When was the information published?
#In which country was it published?
#What is the reputation of the publisher?
#Does the source show a particular cultural or political bias?

For literary sources we might add complementing criteria:

#Does the source contain a bibliography?
#Has the material been reviewed by a group of peers, or has it been edited?
#How does the article/book compare with similar articles/books?

==Levels of generality==
How general are principles of source criticism?
Some principles are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources. One may ask whether principles of source criticism are unique to the humanities?

There is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between natural science and humanities. [[Logical positivism]] claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas [[hermeneutics]] is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of [[Jürgen Habermas]]. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory.  The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus "doubly hermeneutic".

Natural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and, for example, [[academic fraud]]).

==Contributing fields==

===Epistemology===
Epistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources. [[Empiricism]] evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid. [[Rationalism]] provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful observations must be grasped by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view. [[Historicism]] evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development. [[Pragmatism]] evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.

The evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If we accept the principle of [[fallibilism]] we also have to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section is source criticism intimately linked to [[scientific method]]s.

The presence of '''fallacies of argument''' in sources is another kind of philosophical criteria for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the 'ad hominem fallacy' (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the 'straw man fallacy' (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) See also [[fallacy]].

===Research methodology===
Research methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook &amp; Crouch (1998). See also [[Unobtrusive measures]], [[Triangulation (social science)]].

===Science studies===
Studies of quality evaluation processes such as [[peer review]], [[book review]]s and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of [[scientific misconduct]].

Harris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, [[Little Albert]], has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of [[reception history]] (how Watson's paper was received).  It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.

===Textual criticism===
Textual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of [[philology]], which is not just devoted to the study  of texts, but also to edit and produce "scientific editions", "scholarly editions", "standard editions", "historical editions", "reliable editions", "reliable texts", "text editions"  or "critical editions", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept "source criticism" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed "kildekritisk udgave" (directly translated "source critical edition").

In other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce "scholarly editions". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.

===Psychology===
The study of [[eyewitness testimony]] is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More  subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that [[eyewitness memory]] is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.

Anderson (1978) and Anderson &amp; Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.

In psychoanalysis  the concept of [[defence mechanism]] is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.

===Library and information science (LIS)===
In schools of library and information science (LIS) is source criticism of taught as part of the growing field [[Information literacy]].
Study issues like [[relevance]], quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) and related issues are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. [[Bibliometrics]] is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. The study of [[book review]]s and their function in evaluating books should also be mentioned. The well-known comparison of Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica (Giles, 2005) - although not done by information scientists - contained an interview with an information scientist (Michael Twidale) and should be obvious to include in LIS.

It could be argued that library and information education should provide teaching in source criticism at least at the same level as is taught in Upper Secondary School  (see Gudmundsson, 2007).

In library and information science the checklist approach has often been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212549/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): "Chucking the checklist".

Libraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html General Source Criticism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304184332/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html Topicality and Reliability of Printed Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215004102/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html |date=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library of Congress has a "Teaching with Primary Sources" (TPS) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/about/|title=About the Program- Teaching with Primary Sources - Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Source criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the  protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., [[Whistleblower]]).

==In specific domains==

===Photos===


{{See also|Photo manipulation}}

Photos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/was-the-dear-leader-photoshopped-in/?scp=7&amp;sq=Kim%20Jong-il&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Was the Dear Leader Photoshopped In? | first=Jack | last=Healy | date=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet sources===


{{See also|E-mail fraud|Internet fraud}}

Much interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as [[Wikipedia]]) is reflected in the scholarly literature of [[Library and information science]] and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch &amp; Cromwell (2001), Leth &amp; Thurén (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, &amp; Oliver (1997).

=== Archaeology and history ===
"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, ''Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem'' (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved." (Lorenz, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;6870).

As written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).

Two of the best-known rule books from History's childhood are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois &amp; Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell &amp; Prevenier, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;70-71):
# If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proved.
# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis.
# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.
# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most "authority" - - i.e. the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.
# Eyewittnesses are, in general, to be preferred, especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.
# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measureably enhanced.
# When two sources disagree (and there is no other means of evaluation), then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.

Gudmundsson (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;38) writes:  "Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to "tendency analysis".

In [[archaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]] is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on "scientific" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both "source criticism" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of "source materials" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as [[facsimile]]s or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s).

[[Historiography]] and [[Historical method]] include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.

===Biblical studies===
{{Main|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}
Source criticism, as the term is used in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term "literary criticism" is occasionally used as a synonym.

Biblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of Classical antiquity ([[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as "the [[Higher Criticism]]", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.

Related to Source Criticism is [[Redaction Criticism]] which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is [[form criticism]] and [[tradition history]] which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.

===Journalism===

{{See also|Journalism fraud}}

Journalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of [[information source]]s such as [[news bureau]]s, persons which may be interviewed, [[newspaper]]s, [[Academic journal|journals]] and so on (see [[journalism sourcing]]). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.

===Legal studies===

{{See also|Evidence (law)}}

The most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: [[Legal positivism]] is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while [[legal realism]], [[interpretivism (legal)]], [[critical legal studies]] and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.

'''Abstract''':  When classifying the array of interpretive methods currently available, biblical critics regularly distinguish between historical-critical methods, on the one hand, and literary critical methods, on the other. Frequently, methods on one side of the divide are said to be antagonistic to certain methods on the other. This article examines two such presumed antagonistic methods, source criticism and deconstructive criticism, and argues that they are not, in fact, antagonistic, but similar: both are postmodern movements, and both share an interpretive methodology (insofar as it is correct to speak of a deconstructive methodology). This argument is illustrated with a source-critical and a deconstructive reading of Exodus 14.

In [[historiography]], distinctions are commonly made between three kinds of source texts:

===Primary===
{{main|Primary source}}
[[Primary source]]s are firsthand written [[evidence]] of history made at the [[time]] of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_"&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=2005-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with "direct, unmediated information about the object of study."&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

--&gt; Primary sources are sources which, usually, are recorded by someone who participated in, witnessed, or lived through the event. These are also usually authoritative and fundamental documents concerning the subject under consideration.

--&gt; Physical objects can be primary sources.

===Secondary and tertiary===
{{main|Secondary source|Tertiary source}}
[[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. 

[[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html Glossary, Using Information Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html |date=2008-08-28 }}. ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources".) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_" /&gt; These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are [[encyclopedia]]s and [[textbook]]s.

The distinction between  ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' is standard in [[historiography]], while the distinction between these sources and ''tertiary sources'' is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself.

==Types==
Below are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes ''generally'' the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). ''P'' is for Primary sources, ''S'' is for Secondary sources, and ''T'' is for Tertiary sources. (ed., those with ''?''s are indeterminate.)

==In translation==
In translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given [[Source language (translation)|source language]] which is to be, or has been, translated into another language. In translation the source text (ST) is transformed into a [[target text]] (TT), written in a given [[Target language (translation)|target language]]. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Translation scholars including [[Eugene Nida]] and [[Peter Newmark]] have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=67-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephanus pagination''' is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of [[Plato]] (and less famously, [[Plutarch]]) based on the three volume 1578 edition&lt;ref&gt;''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'' edidit Henricus Stephanus, Genevae, 1578.&lt;/ref&gt; of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus ([[Jean de Serres]]) and published by Henricus Stephanus ([[Henri Estienne]]) in [[Geneva]].

==Overview==
In the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e.  This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato.  For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage.  For example, "''Symposium'' 172a" cites ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which ''Symposium'' occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a.  To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, "page 50" might refer to any of the "pages 50" across Stephanus' three volumes.  Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.

More specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. ''Symposium'' 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]]'s [[Oxford Classical Text]], not to Estienne's line divisions.

There are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]''. The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. 

The spurious dialogue ''[[Halcyon (dialogue)|Halcyon]]'' was included in the corpus of [[Lucian]]'s works and does not have Stephanus numbers.

[[Bekker numbering]] is the comparable system for the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Diels–Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.

'''Text Annotation''' is the practice and the result of adding a note or [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and [[Collaborative editing|editing]], commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text.&lt;ref name= "Shabjee and Reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabajee|first=P. and D. Reynolds|title=What is Annotation? A Short Review of Annotation and Annotation Systems|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/publications/researchreport/rr1053/report_html?ilrtyear=2003|work=ILRT Research Report No. 1053|publisher=Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Text annotations are sometimes referred to as [[marginalia]], though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.

This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also [[Web annotation]].

== History ==

Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in [[Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe,|first=Joanna|author2=Christine M. Neuwirth |title=From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|year=2001|volume=15|issue=33|pages=333–370|doi=10.1177/105065190101500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[printing press]] and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or [[Footnotes|textual footnotes or endnotes]] rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, [[learning]], social [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[editing]], and other practices.  Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and [[Computer data storage|storage]] that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds"/&gt;

== Functions and Applications ==

Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks," which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers," which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages," for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function.&lt;ref name = "Wolfe and Neuwirth"/&gt; Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, [[motivation]], and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support [[memory]] and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Catherine|title=Reading and Writing the Electronic Book|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=UNC Chapel Hill|pages=38–51|url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009|doi=10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational applications ===

Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and [[communication]]. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for [[collaborative learning]], both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Effects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Effects of Annotations on Student Readers and Writers|journal=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries|year=2000|pages=19–26|doi=10.1145/336597.336620|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336620|isbn=158113231X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of [[critical reading]] and stance-taking necessary for effective [[Argumentation|argumentative writing]].&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib" /&gt;

While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, "since the 1920s, [[literacy]] theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders /&gt;  Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Nancy|author2=Yoram Chisik |title=In the Company of Readers: The Digital Library Book as "Practiced Place"|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries|year=2005|pages=235–243|doi=10.1145/1065385.1065439|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065439|isbn=1581138768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.&lt;ref name=GunaTanKauferEncouragingReadingandCollaboration&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=Ananda|author2=Aaron Tan |author3=David Kaufer |title=Encouraging Reading and Collaboration Using Classroom Salon|journal=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education|year=2010|pages=254–258|doi=10.1145/1822090.1822162|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=90744943&amp;CFTOKEN=38262707|isbn=9781605587295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, [[critical thinking]], and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall et all Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple Perspectives on Problem Solving and Learning in the Digital Age.|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=313–323|author=Mendenhall, A. |author2=C. Kim |author3=T.E. Johson|editor=D. Ifenthaler |editor2=P. Isaias |editor3=J.M. Spector |editor4=K. D.G. Sampson|chapter=Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool in a College English Course.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them [[English studies|English]], [[sport psychology]], and [[hypermedia]]. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, [[metacognition]], and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.&lt;ref name="Novak et al Educaitonal Uses of Social Annotation Tools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Elena |author2=Rim Razzouk |author3=Tristan E. Johnson|title=The Educational Uses of Social Annotation Tools in Higher Education: A Literature Review|journal=Internet and Higher Education|year=2012|volume=15|pages=39–49|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ947876&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ947876|doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and text-centered collaboration ===

Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called "queries").&lt;ref name=Einsohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Einsohn|first=Emily|title=The Copyeditor's Handbook|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_copyeditor_s_handbook.html?id=qv1p2RYbpY0C|isbn=9780520218352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks.&lt;ref name="Weng and Gennari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chuhnua|author2=John H. Gennari |title=Asynchronous Collaborative Writing Through Annotations|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work '04|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=578–581|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031705|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031607.1031705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of [[computer-supported cooperative work]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez and Eklundh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Henry|author2=Kerstin Severinson Eklundh |title=Visualizing Patterns of Annotation in Document-Centered Collaboration on the Web|journal=Studies in Writing: Vol. 17 Writing and Digital Media|year=2005|pages=131–143|editor1-first=L. |editor1-last=Van Waes |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Leijten |editor3-first=C. |editor3-last=Neuwirth |others=G. Rijlaardsdam (Series Ed.)|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and Design ==

Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.

===Annotation structure===
The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a ''body'', an ''anchor'', and a ''marker''. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated [[symbols]] and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook /&gt;

===Annotation display types===
IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:
* Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text
* Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a "sidebar" layer
* Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text
* Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text
* Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document
* Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen
Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe Annotation Technologies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotation Technologies: A software and Research Review|journal=Computers and Composition|year=2002|volume=19|issue=4|pages=471–497|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(02)00144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as ''anchored discussion''.&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotations and the Collaborative Digital Library: Effects of an Aligned Annotion Interface on Student Argumentation and Reading Strategies|journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|date=Jun 2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–164|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ851577&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ851577|doi=10.1007/s11412-008-9040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT-based text annotation systems ==

IT-based annotation systems include [[Computer software|standalone]] and [[Client-server model|client-server systems]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of [[Library|libraries]], [[patent office]]s, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of annotation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine C.: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263806 Annotation: from paper books to the digital library], Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto]] and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Bibliothèque de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).

Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] Writer and [[Microsoft Word]]. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as [[Adobe Acrobat]], which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds" /&gt;

=== Web-based text annotation systems ===
{{main|Web annotation}}
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] had already implemented the concept&lt;ref name="boulton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archaeology.org/the-nexus-browser/|title=The Nexus Browser|last=Boulton|first=Jim|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of directly editing web documents in 1990 in [[WorldWideWeb]], the first web browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=21 September 2014|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability.&lt;ref name="boulton"/&gt; An early version of [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]] in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability,&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkdroid.org/tmp/www-talk/1192.html|title=Group Annotation Server Guinea Pigs?|last=Andreessen|first=Marc|date=31 May 1993|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was quickly removed.  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, [[WebDAV]], was then reintroduced as an extension.

A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document.  This approach was pioneered by [[Stet (software)|Stet]], the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]]. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The [[co-ment]] system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using [[Django (web framework)|Django]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]] on the server side and various [[AJAX]] libraries such as [[JQuery]] on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU [[Affero General Public License]].

Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin|first=Kenneth|title=IRS Determination Letter|url=https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has offered the free, open web annotation service [[Hypothes.is]]. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a [[Learning management system|LMS]] or [[Content management system|CMS]]. Both [[Web annotation|webpages]] and [[Portable Document Format#Annotation|PDFs]] can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, [http://www.hylighter.com/hybar/site/index.html HyLighter] supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] tasks as [[Named-entity recognition]], relationship extraction or [[Canonicalization|normalization]]. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via [[supervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cejuela|first=Juan Miguel|title=tagtog, interactive and text-mining-assisted annotation of gene mentions in PLOS full-text articles|pmc=3978375|publisher=[[Database (journal)|Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation]]|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal [[PLoS ONE]], published by the [[Public Library of Science]], has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''viz.''}}
{{Wiktionary|viz.|videlicet}}
The abbreviation '''''viz.''''' (or '''''viz''''' without a full stop), short for the Latin {{lang|la|'''videlicet'''|italic=yes|links=no}}, which itself is a contraction from Latin of '''''videre licet''''' meaning "it is permitted to see", is used as a synonym for "namely", "that is to say", "to wit", or "as follows". It is typically used to introduce examples or further details to illustrate a point. For example: "all types of data viz. text, audio, video, pictures, graphics etc. can be transmitted through networking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='videlicet', Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/videlicet?s=t|website=dictionary.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Viz.'' is [[shorthand]] for the adverb ''{{lang|la|videlicet}}''. It uses [[Tironian notes]], a system of Latin shorthand developed {{circa|63 BCE}}. It comprises the first two letters, "vi", followed by the last two, "et", using the z-shaped [[⁊#Current|Tironian "et"]], historically written ⁊,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable |last=Brewer  |first=Ebenezer |year=1970 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn= |page=1132 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;According to E.&amp;nbsp;Cobham Brewer (1810–1897), ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', the same abbreviation mark was used for "habet" and "omnibus".&lt;/ref&gt; a common contraction for "et" in Latin shorthand in [[Ancient Rome]] and [[medieval Europe]].

==Usage==
''Viz.'' is an [[abbreviation]] of ''videlicet'', which itself is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] from [[Latin]] of ''videre licet'' meaning "it is permitted to see".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|The New Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (revised third edition, 1998), pp. 825, 828.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''viz.'' is the continuation of an abbreviation using [[Tironian notes|Tironian ''et'']] (''vi⁊''), the ''z'' replacing the ''⁊'' once the latter had fallen out of common use.

In contradistinction to [[i.e.]] and [[exempli gratia|e.g.]], viz. is used to indicate a detailed description of something stated before, and when it precedes a list of group members, it implies (near) completeness.

* ''Viz.'' is usually read aloud as "that is", "namely", or "to wit",&lt;ref name="AMHER1917"&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; but is sometimes pronounced as it is spelt, viz.: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɪ|z}}.
* ''Videlicet'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|w|ɪ|ˈ|d|eɪ|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref name="AMHER1917" /&gt;

===Examples===
* The main point of his speech, ''viz.'' that our attitude was in fact harmful, was not understood.
* "My grandfather had four sons who grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/148 ''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin''] at Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The noble gases, viz., helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton, and radon, show an unexpected behavior when exposed to this new element.

==Compared with scilicet (sc., ss., §)==
{{Main|Section sign}}
A similar expression is '''''scilicet''''' (from earlier ''scire licet''), abbreviated as ''sc.'', which is Latin for "it is permitted to know". ''Sc.'' provides a parenthetic clarification, removes an  ambiguity, or supplies a word omitted in preceding text,&amp;nbsp; while ''viz.'' is usually used to elaborate or detail text which precedes it.

In legal usage, ''scilicet'' appears abbreviated as ''ss.'' or, in a caption, as [[Section sign|§]], where it  provides a statement of venue{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} and is read as "to wit".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (sixth edition, 1990), p. 1403.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scilicet'' can be read as "namely", "to wit", or "that is to say", or pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|iː|l|ᵻ|k|ɛ|t}} or anglicized as {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ᵻ|s|ɛ|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (fourth edition, 2000), p. 1560.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''William Chaffers''' (28 September 1811 – 12 April 1892) was an English antiquary and writer of reference works on [[hallmark]]s, and marks on [[ceramics]]. His ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain'', first published in 1863, has appeared in many later editions.

==Life==
Chaffers was the son of William Chaffers and wife Sarah, and was born in Watling Street, London, in 1811; he was descended from a brother of [[Richard Chaffers]] (1731–1765), a manufacturer of [[Liverpool porcelain]]. He was educated at Margate and at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], where he was entered in 1824.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|wstitle=Chaffers, William|volume=1|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5016|title=Chaffers, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was attracted to antiquarian studies while a clerk in the city of London, by the discovery of Roman and medieval antiquities in the foundations of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] during 1838–9. At the same time he began to concentrate attention upon the study of gold and silver plate and ceramics, especially in regard to the official and other marks by which dates and places of fabrication can be distinguished. In 1863 Chaffers published two important works:&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate, illustrated, with Tables of Annual Date Letters employed in the Assay Offices of the United Kingdom''; in the 8th edition of 1896 it included "Histories of the Goldsmiths' Trade, both in England and France, and revised London and Provincial Tables", and an introductory essay by C. A. Markham.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain of the Renaissance and Modern Periods, with Historical Notices of each Manufactory, preceded by an introductory Essay on Vasa Fictilia of the Greek, Romano-British, and Mediæval Eras''. The aim of the work was to be for ceramics what {{ill|Franz Brulliot|de}}'s ''Dictionnaire des Monogrammes'' was to painting, and it at once established Chaffers as the leading authority upon his subject.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt; Many subsequent editions have appeared, revised by later editors; the 9th edition appeared in 1900, and the 15th edition in 1965.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Other publications are ''The Keramic Gallery'', in 2 volumes, with 500 illustrations (1872); a handbook abridged from ''Marks and Monograms'' (1874); ''Gilda Aurifabrorum'', a history of goldsmiths and plate workers and their marks (1883); also a priced catalogue of coins, and other minor catalogues.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

His reputation was furthered in organizing exhibitions of art treasures, at [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Manchester in 1857]], [[1862 International Exhibition|South Kensington in 1862]], Leeds in 1869, Dublin in 1872, Wrexham in 1876, and Hanley (at the great Staffordshire exhibition of ceramics) in 1890. Chaffers was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1843, and he was a frequent contributor to ''Archæologia'', to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', and to various learned periodicals upon the two subjects of which he had particular knowledge.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;

In 1841 he married Charlotte Matilda, daughter of John Hewett.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; About 1870 he retired from [[Fitzroy Square]] to a house in Willesden Lane, and later moved to [[West Hampstead]], where he died on 12 April 1892.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
