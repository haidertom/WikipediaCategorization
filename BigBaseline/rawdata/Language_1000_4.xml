'''Abstract Meaning Representation''' ('''AMR''') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.isi.edu|title=Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|semantic representation language]]. AMR graphs are rooted, labeled, directed, acyclic graphs ([[Directed acyclic graph|DAGs]]), comprising whole sentences. They are intended to abstract away from syntactic representations, in the sense that sentences which are similar in meaning should be assigned the same AMR, even if they are not identically worded. By nature, the AMR language is biased towards English – it is not meant to function as an international auxiliary language.

'''Accent reduction''', also known as&amp;nbsp;'''accent modification''' or '''accent neutralization''', is a systematic approach for learning or adopting a new&amp;nbsp;speech [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]. It is the process of learning the sound system (or&amp;nbsp;[[phonology]]) and melodic intonation of a language so the non-native speaker can communicate with clarity to be understood by the general public of this second language. &amp;nbsp;

Accent reduction training is not the same as [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] (English as a Second Language) classes. Accent reduction classes go beyond learning vocabulary and grammar and focus upon clarity of speech and fine tuning a specific accent or dialect. Foreign accent reduction training is typically appropriate for adult learners who have at least a moderate level of conversational proficiency in the second language. Non-native speakers from any background or profession can benefit from accent reduction training. That is not to say that every non-native speaker needs to modify their accent, however. The goal of accent reduction training is to improve speaking clarity so the non-native speaker is understood in the workplace as well as within their community; not necessarily to totally eliminate the accent. Business professionals, physicians, professors, researchers, telemarketers, etc. oftentimes request accent reduction training be provided by their employers so they can communicate more effectively with their colleagues, clients, and customers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://accentfreedom.com/what-is-accent-reduction/|title=What Is Accent Reduction?|last=Christensen|first=Barbara|date=September 13, 2017|website=Accent Freedom|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Foreign born students and professionals can benefit from accent modification training to improve their English intelligibility to be more competitive when interviewing for jobs. &amp;nbsp;Under U.S. labor law, employers can make job decisions based on accent if it interferes with work. The federal&amp;nbsp;[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]&amp;nbsp;does receive a small number of complaints every year from individuals who believe they are victims of accent-related job discrimination.[[Accent reduction#cite note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Types==
Two distinct types of accent reduction training are available: self-study and instructor-led. &amp;nbsp;There are many types of self-study books, apps, cds, and software systems on the market. &amp;nbsp;Some of these products offer materials that are unique to individuals from specific language backgrounds. &amp;nbsp;The self-study learning methods can be helpful especially if audios are included so the user can hear the correct pronunciations. &amp;nbsp;Instructor-led training, although significantly more expensive than the self-study option, allows students to receive personalized instruction, obtain immediate feedback from the trainer, and typically make more timely progress. &amp;nbsp;Instructor-led training is available in a variety of ways: &amp;nbsp;1:1 with an instructor, small group training, seminars, or workshops. &amp;nbsp;Delivery can occur in person, web-based using webcams, or via telephone.

==Training==
Accent modification is offered by various certified speech-language trainers, linguists, and specialists in&amp;nbsp;[[English as a second language|ESL]]. In the&amp;nbsp;[[United States]], they are promoted by various organizations including the&amp;nbsp;[http://accentfreedom.com/ Accent Freedom], the&amp;nbsp;[[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association]]&amp;nbsp;(ASHA), the&amp;nbsp;[http://speak-well.org/ Accent Reduction Training Association] (ARTA), [http://www.corspan.org/ Corporate Speech Pathology Network] (CORSPAN), &amp;nbsp;[https://www.vasta.org/ Voice, Speech Trainers Association] (VASTA).

Instructor-led courses typically start with a speech assessment to determine a student’s unique needs. &amp;nbsp;[[Speech production]] is a very complicated process involving coordinating movements of the lips, tongue, jaw, vocal cords, and respiratory system. &amp;nbsp;Speakers from different language backgrounds have different speech patterns when speaking English as they are attempting to implement their own language’s pronunciation rules while speaking English. &amp;nbsp;Even people from the same language background can have differing speech patterns based upon the age at which they learned English, the characteristics of their teacher’s speech, and influences of other languages they may speak.

Areas of focus may include teaching students clear [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] of vowels and consonants as well as the intonation patterns that are unique to each language. &amp;nbsp;The learning sequence is typically broken down into progressive learning segments until they cumulate into using the newly learned skills in conversation. Additional areas might include linking, rate, or voice projection. &amp;nbsp;Instructor-led accent training will also frequently include conversational practice to help the student transfer these newly learned skills into everyday conversations. &amp;nbsp;

Training timelines can vary from a few days to several months depending upon the chosen model of instruction. &amp;nbsp;Outside practice time is essential for the participant to see significant changes in their speech.

&amp;nbsp;Although accents can be minimized through training, actually eliminating an accent is extremely difficult to master and could take years to accomplish. &amp;nbsp;It is unrealistic to expect total accent elimination in a short period of time. &amp;nbsp;

Accent improvement focuses on teaching students how to pronounce difficult sounds such as {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/ð/}}, {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}; intonation, stress, and rhythm. Spanish and Portuguese speakers might add an {{IPA|/h/}} before the vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, as in "his" for "is". Therefore, vowel sounds are also covered in accent reduction training. Practicing of the vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} most commonly spelled "i" is done by reciting a few of the following differences: his versus is, hit versus it, hill versus ill. By not letting the back of their tongue touch the palate, native speakers of Asian languages (Chinese, etc.) can avoid adding a {{IPA|/j/}} before the {{IPA|/ɪ/}} for example in speaking "yin" instead of "in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Specialists also use activities, games, and printable workbooks to help students practice what they learn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
  
Although the accents can be reduced through training, some [[linguists]] warn against giving students a false hope that they will lose their [[Accent (dialect)|accents]]. According to [[Dennis Baron]], a [[linguistics]] professor at the [[University of Illinois]] at Urbana-Champaign, eliminating an accent is difficult. Calming an accent, he said, takes years of interaction with native English speakers. Even so, under U.S. labor law, employers can make job decisions based on accent if it interferes with work. The federal [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] does receive a small number of complaints every year from individuals who believe they are victims of accent-related job discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The actors [[Portia de Rossi]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], [[Anthony La Paglia]], [[Katherine Langford]], and [[Charlize Theron]] are examples of notable people who received such training to lose their native accents and develop American accents, even in everyday speech.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Article (publishing)|News stories]] and features, whether in magazine writing or broadcast news, can be categorized in terms of '''article structures''' that define the order in which information is introduced to the story.  Some writers deny consciously organizing articles according to specific structures, but may use them to describe the writing ''post hoc''.  Others recognize a style within a developing story and use it to develop the narrative.  Still others may be required to pursue a specific style from the beginning by publisher guidelines.&lt;ref name=Saleh&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KypNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|title=The complete guide to article writing|author=Naveed Saleh|publisher=F+W Media|date=14 January 2014}}  The relevant portion also appears as "Crafting a strong feature article" in Writer's Digest, November/December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structures ==
Some of the structure types include:

=== Inverted pyramid ===
The [[inverted pyramid (journalism)|inverted pyramid]] structure begins with the latest or most important developments, then provides greater description and detail, tapering off with less significant events of relevance.  Proponents of this structure, which is common in news reporting, may criticize other styles as "burying the lead," though others criticize it as a dull style that "tells the joke by starting at the punch line."&lt;ref name=Wenger /&gt; Because this structure is designed to permit truncation by an editor, authors do not need to plan a specific ending as they might with other styles.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2008/04/20080416214312eaifas0.7373773.html|title=Telling the story|date=11 April 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of State Handbook of Independent Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narrative ===
A narrative structure is a straightforward, [[Chronological order|chronological description]] of events.  For example, an article about a set of [[Murder]]s may begin with the discovery of the first victim and end with the imprisonment or execution of a suspect.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;

=== Hourglass ===
The [[hourglass]] structure is a combination of inverted pyramid and narrative structures.  The author begins with key details ([[Five Ws|who, what, when, where, and why]]), and adds details of increasingly lower importance as in the inverted pyramid structure.  The story then abruptly "turns," requiring a clear transition,&lt;ref name=state /&gt; to focus on a narrative, such as the story of a specific eyewitness or party, which addresses finer details and implications, before making its final conclusion.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt; Like the inverted pyramid, it attempts to satisfy readers who don't complete the article, while continuing to engage readers with greater interest.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt; In broadcast news reporting, the narrative portion may be provided by a reporter on the scene, while the beginning and end are told by an [[News presenter|anchor]] at the studio.  The simple narrative portion may be convenient for reporters writing under a deadline.&lt;ref name=Wenger /&gt;

=== Nut-graph ===
An article may begin with an anecdotal "[[Attention seeking|hook]]" to catch the reader's attention.  This is followed by a "[[nut graph]]" paragraph that summarizes the story as a whole.  Body paragraphs then explore these ideas in greater detail, provide useful background, or explain conflicting opinions.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;

=== Diamond ===
The diamond structure is similar to a nut graph, with anecdotal hook, nut graph, and a wealth of general detail, but then progressively narrows these issues and applies them to the anecdote introduced in the hook.  The story may be considered as a "quest" to understand the situation of a single individual.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wenger /&gt; A [[Journalism school|journalism class]] may require this structure for an opinion story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlocal.org/userfiles/626/Classes/1130/review%20story%20rubric.pdf|title=Journalism writing rubrics:  opinion story rubric|publisher=Plain Local Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christmas tree ===
The "Christmas tree" shape of this story broadens out from the introduction and a series of internal turning points or surprises within the narrative, before coming to a final conclusion.  For example, the subject may be revealed to (a)HIV, (b) be unresponsive to existing drugs, (c) learn of an experimental study, but (d) doesn't know if it will work.  Each of these turning points provides the basis for further development of the story.&lt;ref name=Wenger&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBpiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|title=Advancing the story: journalism in a multimedia world|author=Debora Halpern Wenger|publisher=CQ Press|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organic ===
The organic structure, as expounded by [[Jon Franklin]], is composed at its most basic level of visual imagery that provides a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] feel.  These are linked into "foci" that detail an action, which are in turn linked by "transitions in time, mood, subject and character."  A typical sequence of foci may be complication, development, and resolution.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;&lt;!--- editor's note:  Honestly I don't know WTF I'm talking about for this one, except it's roughly what the source says.  Hopefully I'll be able to change that and remove this little note ---&gt;

=== Five-boxes ===
Credited to [[Rick Bragg]], the "five boxes" of this structure are a standard progression: A hook that attracts the reader's attention with a specific image or detail; a nut graph summary; a second lead that introduces remaining facts; details of secondary importance; and a "kicker:" a strong image, comment, or quotation that provides a strong conclusion.&lt;ref name=Saleh /&gt;

A '''circular reference''' is a series of [[reference]]s where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
[[File:Circular Reference.svg|thumb|Circular reference (in red)]]

==In language==
A circular reference is not to be confused with the logical fallacy of a [[circular argument]].  Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use.  Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference.  Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;

:''Her brother gave her a kitten; his sister thanked him for it.''

is circular but not without meaning.  Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's [[Law of non-contradiction]], a fundamental philosophical [[axiom]].  In this view, without self-reference, [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry A. Osborn]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvJTwwCSy8UC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''The future of foreign language education in the United States''], pp.31-33, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-89789-719-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fiengo&gt;Robert Fiengo, Robert May, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V77kaAVpU0UC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22circular+reference%22+-excel+-computer+-programming&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22circular%20reference%22%20-excel%20-computer%20-programming&amp;f=true ''Indices and identity''], pp.59-62, MIT Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-262-56076-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computer programming==
{{For|circular references between objects or resources|Reference counting}}

Circular references can appear in [[computer programming]] when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Function A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called.  So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is.  Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever.  This leads to what is technically known as a [[livelock]].  It also appears in [[spreadsheet]]s when two cells require each other's result.  For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed.  (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference.  It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)

A circular reference represents a big problem in computing.

In ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html CREATE TABLE] for PostgreSQL and [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/clauses002.htm#i1015767 DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples] for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.

A distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output.  The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.&lt;ref name=Fiengo/&gt;

==In spreadsheets==
Circular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the [[Colebrook equation]] and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Solve Implicit Equations Inside Your Worksheet By Anilkumar M, Dr Sreenivasan E and Dr Raghunathan K |url=http://www.frpdesigns.com/iteration.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">'''Cognitive synonymy''' is a type of [[synonym]]y in which synonyms are so similar in [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] that they cannot be differentiated either [[denotation|denotatively]] or [[connotation|connotatively]], that is, not even by [[association of ideas|mental associations]], [[connotation]]s, emotive responses, and [[poetry|poetic value]]. It is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]]) purposes. In [[usage]] employing this definition, synonyms with greater differences are often called near-synonyms rather than synonyms.&lt;ref name="Stanojević_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanojević |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193-200 |url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
If a word is cognitively synonymous with another word, they refer to the same thing independently of [[context (language use)|context]]. Thus, a word is cognitively synonymous with another word [[if and only if]] all instances of both words express the same exact thing, and the referents are [[modal logic|necessarily]] [[identity (philosophy)|identical]], which means that the words' interchangeability is not [[wikt:context-sensitive|context-sensitive]].

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used the concept of cognitive synonymy extensively in his famous 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", where two words were cognitively synonymous if they were interchangeable in every possible instance.&lt;ref name="Hanna_2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hanna |first=Patricia |year=2005 |title=''Cognitive Synonymy'', from Notes on "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~phanna/classes/ling5030/webpostings/notestwodogmas/node14.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |last=Quine |first=Willard Van Orman |year=1951 |title=Two dogmas of empiricism |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=60 |issue= |pages=20–43 |url=http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html |doi= |postscript=. Reprinted in his 1953 book ''From a Logical Point of View''. Harvard University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
* All bachelors are unmarried men.
* All unmarried men are not married.

Quine notes that if one is [[use-mention distinction|referring to the word itself]], this doesn't apply, as in,
* ''Bachelor'' has fewer than ten letters.

As compared to the substitution which is obviously false,
* "Unmarried men" has less than ten letters.

'''Community interpreting''' is a specific type of [[interpreting]] service which is found more in community-based than organisational situations.  It is a particularly vital service in communities with large numbers of [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]], enabling those minorities to access services where, due to the [[language barrier]], they would otherwise find it difficult. Situations where such interpreters are necessary are typical include medical, educational, [[House|housing]], [[social security]] and legal areas.

Community interpreters need not only to be fluent in the language that they are interpreting, but also with the [[public services]] involved, to be aware of the cultural and racial implications of the interpreting work. Interpreters are also expected to follow the Interpreter's Code of Ethics.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Constraint-based grammars''' can perhaps be best understood in contrast to [[generative grammar]]s. A generative grammar lists all the transformations, merges, movements, and deletions that can result in all [[well-formedness|well-formed]] sentences, while constraint-based grammars, take the opposite approach, allowing anything that is not otherwise constrained. "The grammar is nothing but a set of constraints that structures are required to satisfy in order to be considered well-formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A constraint-based grammar is more like a data base or a knowledge representation system than it is like a collection of algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''definite description''' is a [[denotation|denoting]] [[phrase]] in the form of "the X" where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common [[noun]]. The definite description is ''proper'' if X applies to a unique individual or object.  For example: "[[Yuri Gagarin|the first person in space]]" and "[[Bill Clinton|the 42nd President of the United States of America]]", are proper. The definite descriptions "the person in space" and "the Senator from Ohio" are ''improper'' because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing, and the definite descriptions "the first man on Mars" and "the Senator from some Country" are ''improper'' because X applies to nothing. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the [[law of excluded middle]], [[denotation]], [[Linguistic modality|modality]], and [[mental content]].

==Russell's analysis==
{{main|Theory of descriptions}}
As [[France]] is [[French Fifth Republic|currently a republic]], it has no king. [[Bertrand Russell]] pointed out that this raises a puzzle about the truth value of the sentence "The present King of France is bald."

The sentence does not seem to be true: if we consider all the bald things, the present King of France isn't among them, since there is [[List of French monarchs|no present King of France]]. But if it is false, then one would expect that the [[negation]] of this statement, that is, "It is not the case that the present King of France is bald," or its [[logical equivalence|logical equivalent]], "The present King of France is not bald," is true. But this sentence doesn't seem to be true either: the present King of France is no more among the things that fail to be bald than among the things that are bald.  We therefore seem to have a violation of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]].

Is it meaningless, then?  One might suppose so (and some philosophers have; see below) since "the present King of France" certainly does [[Failure to refer|fail to refer]]. But on the other hand, the sentence "The present King of France is bald" (as well as its negation) seem perfectly intelligible, suggesting that "the Present King of France" can't be meaningless.

Russell proposed to resolve this puzzle via his [[theory of descriptions]].  A definite description like "the present King of France", he suggested, isn't a [[reference|referring]] expression, as we might naively suppose, but rather an "incomplete symbol" that introduces [[Quantifier (logic)|quantificational]] structure into sentences in which it occurs. The sentence "the present King of France is bald", for example, is analyzed as a conjunction of the following three [[Quantifier (logic)|quantified]] statements:

# there is an x such that x is currently King of France: &lt;math&gt;\exists xKx&lt;/math&gt; (using 'Kx' for 'x is currently King of France')
# for any x and y, if x is currently King of France and y is currently King of France, then x=y (i.e. there is at most one thing which is currently King of France): &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ((Kx \land Ky) \rightarrow x=y)&lt;/math&gt;
# for every x that is currently King of France, x is bald: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (Kx \rightarrow Bx)&lt;/math&gt; (using 'B' for 'bald')

More briefly put, the claim is that "The present King of France is bald" says that some x is such that x is currently King of France, and that any y is currently King of France only if y = x, and that x is bald: 

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''false'', since it is ''not'' the case that some x is currently King of France.

The negation of this sentence, i.e. "The present King of France is not bald", is ambiguous.  It could mean one of two things, depending on where we place the negation 'not'.  On one reading, it could mean that there is no one who is currently King of France and bald:

:&lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

On this disambiguation, the sentence is ''true'' (since there is indeed no x that is currently King of France).

On a second reading, the negation could be construed as attaching directly to 'bald', so that the sentence means that there is currently a King of France, but that this King fails to be bald:

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land \lnot Bx)&lt;/math&gt;

On this disambiguation, the sentence is ''false'' (since there is no x that is currently King of France).

Thus, whether "the present King of France is not bald" is true or false depends on how it is interpreted at the level of [[logical form]]: if the [[negation]] is construed as taking wide scope (as in the first of the above)), it is true, whereas if the negation is construed as taking narrow scope (as in the second of the above]), it is false. In neither case does it lack a truth value.

So we do ''not'' have a failure of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]]: "the present King of France is bald" (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;) is false, because there is no present King of France.  The negation of this statement is the one in which 'not' takes wide scope: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x ((Kx \land \forall y (Ky \rightarrow y = x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;.  This statement is ''true'' because there does not exist anything which is currently King of France.

== Generalized quantifier analysis ==

[[Stephen Neale]], among others, has defended Russell's theory, and incorporated it into the theory of [[generalized quantifier]]s.  On this view, 'the' is a quantificational determiner like 'some', 'every', 'most' etc. The definite description 'the' has the following denotation (using [[lambda calculus|lambda]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda f. \lambda g.\exists x(f(x)=1 \land \forall y(f(y)=1 \rightarrow y=x) \land g(x) = 1)&lt;/math&gt;

(That is, the definite article 'the' denotes a function which takes a pair of [[property|properties]] f and g to truth [[if and only if|if, and only if]] there exists something that has the property f, only one thing has the property f, and that thing also has the property g.) Given the denotation of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] 'present King of France' (again K for short) and 'bald' (B for short)

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.Kx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x.Bx&lt;/math&gt;

we then get the Russellian truth conditions via two steps of [[function application]]: 'The present King of France is bald' is true if, and only if &lt;math&gt;\exists x((Kx \land \forall y(Ky \rightarrow y =x)) \land Bx)&lt;/math&gt;.  On this view, definite descriptions like 'the present King of France' do have a denotation (specifically, definite descriptions denote a function from properties to truth values—they are in that sense not [[syncategorematic]], or "incomplete symbols"); but the view retains the essentials of the Russellian analysis, yielding exactly the truth conditions Russell argued for.

==Fregean analysis==

The Fregean analysis of definite descriptions, implicit in the work of [[Frege]] and later defended by [[P. F. Strawson|Strawson]] (1950) among others, represents the primary alternative to the Russellian theory. On the Fregean analysis, definite descriptions are construed as [[referring expression]]s rather than [[Quantifier (logic)|quantificational expressions]].  Existence and uniqueness are understood as a [[presupposition]] of a sentence containing a definite description, rather than part of the content asserted by such a sentence.  The sentence 'The present King of France is bald', for example, isn't used to claim that there exists a unique present King of France who is bald; instead, that there is a unique present King of France is part of what this sentence ''presupposes'', and what it ''says'' is that this individual is bald.  If the presupposition fails, the definite description [[empty name|fails to refer]], and the sentence as a whole fails to express a [[proposition]].

The Fregean view is thus committed to the kind of [[truth value]] gaps (and failures of the [[Law of Excluded Middle]]) that the Russellian analysis is designed to avoid.  Since there is currently no King of France, the sentence 'The present King of France is bald' fails to express a proposition, and therefore fails to have a truth value, as does its [[negation]], 'The present King of France is not bald'.  The Fregean will account for the fact that these sentences are nevertheless ''meaningful'' by relying on speakers' knowledge of the conditions under which either of these sentences ''could'' be used to express a true proposition.  The Fregean can also hold on to a restricted version of the Law of Excluded Middle: for any sentence whose presuppositions are met (and thus expresses a proposition), either that sentence or its negation is true.

On the Fregean view, the definite article 'the' has the following denotation (using [[lambda calculus|lambda]] notation):

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda f: \exists x(f(x)=1 \land \forall y(f(y)=1 \rightarrow y=x)).&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; [The unique z such that &lt;math&gt;f(z)=1&lt;/math&gt;]

(That is, 'the' denotes a function which takes a property f and yields the unique object z that has property f, if there is such a z, and is undefined otherwise.)  The presuppositional character of the existence and uniqueness conditions is here reflected in the fact that the definite article denotes a [[partial function]] on the set of properties: it is only defined for those properties f which are true of exactly one object.  It is thus undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'currently King of France', since the property of currently being King of France is true of no object; it is similarly undefined on the denotation of the predicate 'Senator of the US', since the property of being a US Senator is true of more than one object.

== Mathematical logic ==
{{main|Uniqueness quantification}}
Following the example of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', it is customary to use a definite description operator symbolized using the "turned" (rotated) Greek lower case iota character "℩". The notation ℩&lt;math&gt;x(\phi x)&lt;/math&gt; means "the unique &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi x&lt;/math&gt;", and

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(&lt;/math&gt;℩&lt;math&gt;x(\phi x))&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to "There is exactly one &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and it has the property
&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;":

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x (\forall y (\phi(y) \iff y=x) \land \psi(x))&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11360">'''Distributional semantics''' is a research area that develops and studies theories and methods for quantifying and categorizing semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The basic idea of distributional semantics can be summed up in the so-called Distributional hypothesis: ''linguistic items with similar distributions have similar meanings.''

==Distributional hypothesis==
The '''distributional hypothesis''' in [[linguistics]] is derived from the [[semantic theory]] of language usage, i.e. words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The underlying idea that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was popularized by [[J. R. Firth|Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Firth|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Distributional Hypothesis is the basis for [[statistical semantics]]. Although the Distributional Hypothesis originated in linguistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is now receiving attention in [[cognitive science]] especially regarding the context of word use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|Ramscar|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the distributional hypothesis has provided the basis for the theory of [[similarity-based generalization]] in language learning: the idea that children can figure out how to use words they've rarely encountered before by generalizing about their use from distributions of similar words.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Gleitman|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Yarlett|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The distributional hypothesis suggests that the more semantically similar two words are, the more distributionally similar they will be in turn, and thus the more that they will tend to occur in similar linguistic contexts.  Whether or not this suggestion holds has significant implications for both the [[data-sparsity]] problem in computational modeling, and for the question of how children are able to learn language so rapidly given relatively impoverished input (this is also known as the problem of the [[poverty of the stimulus]]).

==Distributional semantic modeling==
Distributional semantics favor the use of linear algebra as computational tool and representational framework. The basic approach is to collect distributional information in high-dimensional vectors, and to define distributional/semantic similarity in terms of vector similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rieger |1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different kinds of similarities can be extracted depending on which type of distributional information is used to collect the vectors: '''topical''' similarities can be extracted by populating the vectors with information on which text regions the linguistic items occur in; '''paradigmatic''' similarities can be extracted by populating the vectors with information on which other linguistic items the items co-occur with. Note that the latter type of vectors can also be used to extract '''syntagmatic''' similarities by looking at the individual vector components.

The basic idea of a correlation between distributional and semantic similarity can be operationalized in many different ways. There is a rich variety of computational models implementing distributional semantics, including [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deerwester|Dumais|Furnas|Landauer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperspace Analogue to Language]] (HAL), syntax- or dependency-based models,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Padó|Lapata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[random indexing]], [[semantic folding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv=1511.08855|title=Semantic Folding Theory And its Application in Semantic Fingerprinting|last=De Sousa Webber|first=Francisco|date=2015|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various variants of the [[topic model]].

Distributional semantic models differ primarily with respect to the following parameters:

* Context type (text regions vs. linguistic items)
* Context window (size, extension, etc.)
* Frequency weighting (e.g. [[entropy]], [[pointwise mutual information]], etc.)
* Dimension reduction (e.g. [[random indexing]], [[singular value decomposition]], etc.)
* [[Similarity measure]] (e.g. [[cosine similarity]], [[Minkowski distance]], etc.)

Distributional semantic models that use linguistic items as context have also been referred to as '''word space models'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schütze|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sahlgren|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compositional==

[[Compositional distributional semantics|Compositional distributional semantic]] models are an extension of distributional semantic models that characterize the semantics of entire phrases or sentences. This is achieved by composing the distributional representations of the words that sentences contain. Different approaches to composition have been explored, and are under discussion at established workshops such as [[SemEval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1/|title=SemEval-2014, Task 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simpler non-compositional models fail to capture the semantics of larger linguistic units as they ignore grammatical structure and logical words, which are crucial for their understanding.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Applications==

Distributional semantic models have been applied successfully to the following tasks:
* finding [[semantic similarity]] between words and multi-word expressions;
* [[Keyword clustering|word clustering]] based on semantic similarity;
* automatic creation of [[thesauri]] and bilingual dictionaries;
* lexical ambiguity resolution;
* expanding search requests using synonyms and associations;
* defining the topic of a document;
* [[document clustering]] for [[information retrieval]];
* [[data mining]] and [[named entities recognition]];
* creating [[semantic mapping (literacy)|semantic maps]] of different subject domains;
* [[paraphrasing]];
* [[sentiment analysis]];
* modeling selectional preferences of words.

"The Evaluation of Language Regimes: Theory and Application to Multilingual Patent Organisations," [https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/mdm.3/main]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14664200308668048 | volume=4 | title=Language Planning and Economics | year=2003 | journal=Current Issues in Language Planning | pages=1–66 | last1 = Grin | first1 = François}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is relevant to analysis of [[language policy]].

In his book 'Language and economy',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the German sociolinguist [[Florian Coulmas]] discusses "the many ways in which language and economy interact, how economic developments influence the emergence, expansion, or decline of languages; how linguistic conditions facilitate or obstruct the economic process; how multilingualism and social affluence are interrelated; how and why language and money fulfill similar functions in modern societies; why the availability of a [[standard language]] is an [[Comparative advantage|economic advantage]]; how the unequal distribution of languages in [[Multilingual society|multilingual societies]] makes for [[economic inequality]]; how the [[economic value]] of languages can be assessed; why languages have an [[Internal economies of scale|internal economy]] and how they adapt to the demands of the [[external economy]]. Florian Coulmas shows that language is the medium of business, an asset in itself and sometimes a [[Trade barrier|barrier to trade]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and economy|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|year=1992|isbn=978-0631185246|edition=|location=Oxford|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States shoulder language costs, because it maintains themselves by means of it, as does business which needs communication competence. Florian Coulmas discusses the language-related expenditures of government and business in Language and economy.&lt;ref&gt;'The constliness of the polyglot world' in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p. 55, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book he also discusses the role of language as a commodity, because languages can behave like economic systems. That is why socio-economic ecologies are (dis)favorable to particular languages.&lt;ref&gt;Salikoko S. Mufwene, [[Globalization and the Myth of Killer Languages: What's Really Going on?]],17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of languages depends in an essential way on economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Language careers : economic determinants of language evolution, in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p. 55, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Language can be an expression of [[symbolic power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and symbolic power|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, changes in the [[linguistic map]] of the world show that these are also powerful linked to economic developments in the world. Assigning an economic value to a certain language in the linguistic market place means vesting it with some of the privileges and power related to that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwHtreArk_YC&amp;pg=PA242|title=Nkonko M.

==Global language and global economy==
Languages are capital investments in a literal sense : language technology is the most important one. It requires substantial investments which, in the absence of profitability, only affluent countries and businesses can afford. In this respect, today ''English is seen as a consequence and an instrument of American imperial power, an appreciable asset for American anglophones in the twenty-first-century global contest for competitive advantage, prosperity, and power''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cohen, [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-linguistic-empire The Rise and Fall of American Linguistic Empire, I want you to speak English], [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/about-dissent-magazine Dissent Magazine], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Though the best business language remains the language of the customers, meaning multilingual business practices, an "ideal' global economy presupposes a single language for the whole world. But an "ideal" global language presupposes a common acceptable and fair language burden for all business partners. See in this respect [[language tax]] to counteract linguistic inequality, as also language for purposes of trade incurs costs to most countries and private entreprises, whereas governments of countries whose language occupies a leading position on the international language market refuse to subsidize the spread of other languages for which they believe they have no need. In his report ''L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique'', [[François Grin]] argues that 'though some languages would be more beneficial in terms of cost-benefit analysis' such as e.g. Esperanto  (Esperanto business groups such as IKEF have been active for many years), the problem is that a shifting pattern in the valuation of languages is not always brought about by rationally culculable factors only. In addition to its economic potential, language is also a carrier of political, cultural and sociopsychological properties. In spite of the non-economic values attached to language, what prevails in matters of language is often that which is profitable &lt;ref&gt;'The costliness of the polyglot world : language-related expenditures of government and busininess' in : in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p. 152, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to the superiority of a dominant language as a means of production, with a high linguistic capital value. In this respect it is evident to see that the will (or necessity) to learn English in the last decades has grown so much and its range of action has been so wide that the economic necessity and other incentives of foreign-language study are generally perceived as unimportant. For similar reasons, former British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] tried to torpedo the LINGUA program of the European Community, as from her point of view, Britain was asked to pay for a program which benefited her country least. Because of the enormous imbalance on current accounts of the major European languages in favour of English, the [[LINGUA programme]] called for an expansion and diversification of foreign-language education in the Member States. For the individual speaker the unequal linguistic balances imply that the first language is an economically exploitable qualification for some who can simply marketing their mother tongue skills, whereas others can not.&lt;ref&gt;Value for Whom ? in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p.86, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is in the general interest of the United States to encourage the development of a world in which the fault lines separating nations are bridged by shared interests. And it is in the economic and political interests of the United States to ensure that if the world is moving toward a common language, it be English; that if the world is moving toward common telecommunications, safety, and quality standards, they be American; that if the world is becoming linked by television, radio, and music, the programming be American; and that if common values are being developed, they be values with which Americans are comfortable."

The '''European Day of Languages''' is 26 September, as proclaimed by the [[Council of Europe]] on 6 December 2001, at the end of the [[European Year of Languages]] (2001), which had been jointly organised by the Council of Europe and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=16954&amp;lang=en |title=Recommendation 1539 (2001) Final version: European Year of Languages|website=assemby.coe.int|date=2001|accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to encourage [[language learning]] across [[Europe]].

==Objectives==
The general objectives of the European Day of Languages are to:
* Alert the public to the importance of language learning and diversify the range of languages learned in order to increase [[multilingualism|plurilingualism]] and [[intercultural communication|intercultural understanding]]; 
* Promote the rich linguistic and [[cultural diversity]] of Europe;
* Encourage lifelong language [[lifelong learning|learning]] in and out of school.

In keeping with these rules, people, young and old, are encouraged to take up a language, or take special pride in their existing language skills. Also, those responsible for providing access to language learning are encouraged to make it easier for people to learn a range of languages, and to support policy initiatives to promote languages. There is also emphasis on learning a language other than English.

On the occasion of the day, a range of events are organised across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecml.at/edl/default.asp?t=database |title=European Day of Languages 2012 / Journée européenne des langues 2012 |publisher=Ecml.at |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;quot;European Day of Languages&amp;quot; |url=https://news.google.com/nwshp?tab=wn&amp;q=%22European+Day+of+Languages%22&amp;ie=UTF-8 |title=European Day of Languages |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; including those for children, television and radio programmes, language classes and conferences. The events are not organised by the Council of Europe or the European Union nor do they allocate special funding (i.e. apart from their existing language programmes) for the day. Member states and potential partners are given a free hand to organise activities. To coordinate the activities organised at national level, the Council of Europe asks participating countries to nominate "National Relay Persons" for the day. The national relay in the UK used to be CILT, the National Centre for Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/edl |title=European Day of Languages |publisher=Cilt.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324141035/http://www.cilt.org.uk/edl/ |archivedate=2009-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages of Europe==
{{main|Languages of Europe}}
There are about 225 [[indigenous language]]s in Europe &amp;ndash; roughly 3% of the world's total{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Most of the [[European languages]] are of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin. Since the end of the 18th century, the most widespread language of Europe (both in terms of geography and the number of native speakers) has been [[Russian language|Russian]], which replaced French. Counting only native speakers, approximately 150 million Europeans speak Russian on a daily basis, followed by [[German language|German]] (approx. 95 mil.), [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (each by 65 mil.), [[Italian language|Italian]] (60 mil.), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] (40 mil. each), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (30 mil.) and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (26 mil.). As far as foreign language studies are concerned, English is currently the most popular foreign language in Europe, followed by German, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish

==Multilingualism today==
{{Main|List of multilingual countries and regions#Europe}}
According to the European Union survey "Europeans and their Languages" ("Special [[Eurobarometer]] 243", February 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|title=Europeans and their Languages|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 56% of EU [[citizen]]s (25 member states) speak a language other than their [[mother tongue]], but 44% admit to not knowing any languages other than their [[native language]]. However, 28% have knowledge of two foreign languages. Among EU citizens, 38% indicate that they know [[English language|English]], followed by 14% knowing [[French language|French]] or [[German language|German]], 7% Russian, 5% Spanish and 3% Italian. The typical multilingual European is a student or someone holding a managerial position or someone born in a country where the language of his/her parents is different from the main language of the country.

With greater numbers of [[immigrant]]s and [[refugee]]s, European cities have become more multilingual.{{when|date=September 2012}} For example: in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] many recent immigrants speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Tatar]], [[Azeri]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or one of many other languages; in [[London]] some 300 languages are spoken ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] etc.).

The European Union adheres to a policy of multilingualism, both in its institutional workings and as an aim for its citizens. At the 2002 [[European Council|EU summit]] in [[Barcelona]], it set a target for children to learn at least two foreign languages from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/71025.pdf|title=Presidency Conclusions; March 2002|publisher=Ue.eu.int|accessdate=2012-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205041113/http://ue.eu.int/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/71025.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multilingualism for the EU is linked to [[employment|worker mobility]] and the European economy. The European Union spends more than €30 million a year promoting language learning and linguistic diversity through the ''[[Socrates programme|Socrates]]'' and ''[[Leonardo da Vinci programme|Leonardo da Vinci]]'' programmes, a policy that began with the pioneering ''[[Lingua programme]]'' in 1990.

The '''Even language''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|n}}, also known as '''Lamut''', '''Ewen''', '''Eben''', '''Orich''', '''Ilqan''' ({{lang-ru|Эве́нский язы́к}}, earlier also {{lang|ru|Ламутский язы́к}}), is a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language spoken by the [[Evens]] in Siberia.  It is spoken by widely scattered communities of reindeer herders from [[Kamchatka]] and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the east to the [[Lena River|River Lena]] in the west, and from the [[Arctic coast]] in the north to the River [[Aldan River|Aldan]] in the south. Even is an [[endangered language]], with only some 5,700 speakers (Russian census, 2010). These speakers are specifically from the Magadan region, the Chukot region and the Koryak region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/even.htm|title=Even (Lamut) language and alphabet|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialects are Arman, Indigirka, Kamchatka, Kolyma-Omolon, Okhotsk, Ola, Tompon, Upper Kolyma, Sakkyryr, Lamunkhin.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these regions where the Evens primarily reside, the Even language is generally implemented in pre-school and elementary school, alongside the national language, [[Russian language|Russian]]. Where Even functioned primarily as an [[oral language]] communicated between reindeer herding brigades, textbooks began circulating throughout these educational institutions from around 1925 to 1995. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/even.shtml|title=Endangered Languages of Siberia - The Even Language|website=lingsib.iea.ras.ru|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syntax of the Even language follows the nominative case and SOV (subject-object-verb) word order, with the attribute preceding the dependent member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/even.shtml|title=Endangered Languages of Siberia - The Even Language|website=lingsib.iea.ras.ru|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language contact==
In some remote Arctic villages, such as [[Russkoye Ustye]], whose population descended from Russian-Even intermarriage, the language spoken into the 20th century was a dialect of Russian with a strong Even influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lilab/krasovitsky/krasovitsky-eng/archive.htm Russian dialects in East Siberia and Kamchatka].

'''Fay Kee Bolee''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ف کی بولی}}}}, lit. ''Fay Language'') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] used by [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speaking people in [[Pakistan]]. It can be regarded as a trivial [[substitution cipher]] and it is sometimes used by adults to converse in (perceived) privacy in the presence of children. It is close to games found in other languages such as [[Farfallino Alphabet|Farfallino alphabet]] ([[italian language|Italian]]), [[jeringonza]] ([[spanish language|Spanish]]/[[portuguese language|Portuguese]]), and [[Pig Latin]] ([[english language|English]]).

"''Fay''" ({{Nastaliq|ف}}), Urdu language Alphabet corresponding to the sound of ''F'' in English, can be replaced by most other consonants to form another variety. [[Pay ki Boli]] is another more complex variation of the language game.

==Rules==
The game is based on a simple substitution: adding an extra ''F'' before each vowel of a syllable. Insert ''fay'' in the middle of each syllable (usually before the vowel - splitting the syllable into two) in each word. In some monosyllabic words which would still be so obvious, "''yay''" ({{Nastaliq|ی}}), Urdu alphabet for ''Y'', iyfa
* kya (what) = kfya or kfy`yfa
* kis (which) = kfis
* ko  (to)  = kfo

[[File:ConnectorSymbols.svg|thumb|Schematic symbols for male and female connector pins]]
In [[electrical]] and [[machine|mechanical]] trades and manufacturing, each half of a pair of mating [[Electrical connector|connectors]] or [[fastener]]s is conventionally assigned the designation '''male''' or '''female'''. The "female" connector is generally a [[AC power plugs and sockets|receptacle]] that receives and holds the "male" connector. On occasion, the terms "male" and "female" are respectively referred to as the '''A''' and '''B''' ends{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, though the names of some standards conflict with this as they contain the letters A or B within the name; unambiguous, though rare, terms include '''plug''' and '''socket''' or '''jack'''.

The assignment is a direct [[analogy]] with [[genitalia]] and [[heterosexual]] [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]; the part bearing one or more [[Protrusion|protrusions]], or which fits inside the other, being designated [[male]] in contrast to the part containing the corresponding indentations, or fitting outside the other, being designated [[female]]. Extension of the analogy results in the verb '''to [[mating|mate]]''' being used to describe the process of connecting two corresponding parts together. 

In some cases (notably electrical power connectors), the gender of connectors is selected according to rigid rules, to enforce a sense of one-way directionality (e.g. a flow of power ''from'' one device ''to'' another). This gender distinction is implemented to enhance safety or ensure proper functionality by preventing unsafe or non-functional configurations from being set up.

In terms of mathematical [[graph theory]], an electrical power distribution network made up of plugs and sockets is a [[directed tree]], with the directionality arrows corresponding to the female-to-male transfer of electrical power through each mated connection. This is an example where male and female connectors have been deliberately designed and assigned to physically enforce a safe network topology.

In other contexts, such as plumbing, one-way flow is ''not'' enforced through connector gender assignment. Flows through piping networks can be bidirectional, as in underground water distribution networks which have designed-in [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. In plumbing situations where one-way flow ''is'' desired, it is implemented through other means (e.g. gravity flow, one-way check valves), and not through male-female gender schemes.

==Mechanical fasteners==
[[Image:Bolt-with-nut.jpg|thumb|''Female'' nut threaded onto a ''male'' bolt]]
In mechanical design, the prototypical "male" component is a threaded bolt, but an alignment post, a [[mounting boss]], or a sheet metal tab connector can also be considered as male. Correspondingly, a threaded nut, an alignment hole, a mounting recess, or sheet metal slot connector is considered to be female.

While some mechanical designs are "one-off" custom setups not intended to be repeated, there is an entire [[fastener]] industry devoted to manufacturing mass-produced or semi-custom components. To avoid unnecessary confusion, conventional definitions of fastener gender have been defined and agreed upon.

==Modular construction toys==
[[Image:LEGO-01.jpg|thumb|Lego toy brick connections are ''male'' on top, and ''female'' underneath]]
Although this aspect is not highlighted in their promotional literature, several common construction toys&lt;ref name=Toys&gt;[[:Category:Construction toys]]&lt;/ref&gt; embody gendered (and in some cases, genderless) mechanical interconnections. This should not be surprising, since these toys feature the nearly infinite flexibility and versatility of shape that a modular interconnect architecture can enable. Mathematicians have begun to classify well-known [[construction set]]s using [[group theory]] to study the combinatoric possibilities of structures that can be built.

For example, the canonical [[LEGO]] plastic blocks have "female" indentations on the lower surface, and "male" bosses or protrusions on the upper surfaces. [[Meccano]] and [[Erector]] have many gendered connections, starting with the nut-and-bolt fasteners they use frequently.

[[Stickle bricks]], using interlocking plastic protrusions, are effectively genderless. [[Lincoln logs]] use a very simple form of genderless connections. [[Kapla]] or [[KEVA planks]] are extremely simple genderless systems interconnected only by gravity.

In plumbing fittings, the "M" or "F" usually comes at the beginning rather than the end of the abbreviated designation. For example:
* MIPT denotes Male Iron Pipe Thread;
* FIPT denotes Female Iron Pipe Thread.

A short length of pipe having an MIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Nipple|nipple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plumbingsupply.com/chrome.html Chrome Fittings &amp; Nipples]&lt;/ref&gt; A short pipe fitting having an FIP thread at both ends is sometimes called a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Coupling|coupling]].

[[Hermaphroditic]] connections, which include both male and female elements in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as [[Storz]] [[fire hose]] connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in the 
[[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)]] connectors section of this article.

==Downspout==
[[Downspout]]s ('''downpipes''', '''rain conductors''' or '''leaders''') are used to convey rainwater from [[roof gutters]] to the ground through hollow pipes or tubes.  These tubes usually come in sections, joined by inserting the male end (often [[crimp connection|crimped]] with a special tool to slightly reduce its size) into the female end of the next section.  These connections are usually not sealed or caulked, instead relying on gravity to move the rainwater from the male end and into the receiving female connection located directly below.

==Ductwork==
[[Sheet metal]] [[ductwork]] for conveying air in [[HVAC]] systems typically uses gendered connections.  Typically,  the airflow through a ductwork connection is from male to female.  However, since one-way flow is implemented by forced-air fans or blowers,  "backwards" gendered connections can be seen frequently in some systems, since all connections are typically sealed with duct sealing [[Adhesive|mastic]] or tape to prevent leakage anyway.  The flow convention is usually loosely adhered to for simplicity of design, and to reduce the number of gender changer fittings required, but exceptions are made whenever expedient.

Although the gender of tubing and plumbing fittings is usually obvious, this may not be true of [[electrical connectors]] because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female [[D-subminiature]] connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the "maleness" of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of ''male pins'', rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like [[XLR connector|XLR]]. The male/female distinction is more obvious with ring crimp lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split ring crimp lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.

Further confusion can be caused by the term "[[jack (connector)|jack]]", which is used for both female and male connectors and typically refers to the fixed (panel) side of a connector pair. IEEE STD 100, IEEE-315-1975 and [[IEEE 200-1975]] (replaced by [[ASME Y14.44-2008]]) define "[[plug (connector)|Plug]]" and "[[jack (connector)|Jack]]" by location or mobility, rather than gender.&lt;ref name=IEEE3151975&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphic Symbols for Electrical and Electronics Diagrams (including Reference Designation Letters)|year=1975|publisher=IEEE|url=http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/315-1975.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE2001975&gt;{{cite book | title = Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments: IEEE-200-1975 (Reaffirmed 1988): Section 4.1.5.3 | publisher = IEEE and ANSI, New York, NY | year = 1975 | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ieee-200-1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASME-y14-44-2008&gt;{{cite book | title = Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipment: ASME Y14.44-2008 : Section 2.1.5.3 (2) | publisher = ASME, Fairfield, NJ | year = 2008 | url = https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/y1444-2008-reference-designations-electrical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A connector in a fixed location is a jack and a moveable connector is a plug.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt; The distinction is relative, so a portable radio is considered stationary compared to the cable from the headphones; the radio has a jack, and the headphone cable has a plug. Where the relationship is equal, such as when two flexible cables are connected, each is considered a plug.  Jacks use the [[reference designator]] prefix of J and plugs use the [[reference designator]] prefix of P.&lt;ref name="IEEE3151975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASME-y14-44-2008" /&gt;  It is possible in the case of box mounted connectors for the connector to be a receptacle with male pin contacts.  In this case the connector is designated a jack (J ref des) regardless of the contact gender because the housing for the contacts is in fact configured as the receptacle even though its mate (the plug) goes around the receptacle. See MIL-STD-38999 and similar cases.

It is common practice to use female connectors for jacks, so the informal gender-based usage often happens to agree with the functional description of the technical standards. However, this is ''not'' always the case; often-seen exceptions include a computer's AC Power Inlet and EIA232 DE9 Serial Port, or the male [[Coaxial power connector|coaxial power]] jacks for connecting external power adapters to portable equipment.

To summarize, it is considered best practice to use "male" and "female" for connector ''gender'', and "plug" and "jack" for connector ''function'' or ''mobility''.

===Variant usages===
In the UK, many [[Commonwealth countries]] and some non-English-speaking countries{{where|date=March 2012}}, the word "jack" may refer to the ''plug'' on the end of a removable cable. These connectors were originally referred to as "jack plugs", or plugs intended to be mated with fixed receptacles, or ''sockets'' (which North Americans would call "jacks"), but the second word was dropped.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This variant usage is in direct contradiction to common usage and official standards in North America.

In the United Kingdom, for example, the connector on the end of a headphone lead is known as a "jack", that plugs into a ''socket'' on the main unit. The same generally occurs also in Italy, where the English word "jack" is commonly used to indicate the connector on the end of a headphone lead.

In Romania female connectors are known as "mamă" (mother) and male connectors are "tată" (father).

===Abbreviations and alternate terminology===
The standard letters "M" and "F" are commonly used in part numbers to designate connector gender. For example, in Switchcraft XLR [[microphone]] or [[hydrophone]] connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:
* A3F = Audio 3-pin Female connector;
* A3M = Audio 3-pin Male connector.

The terms '''plug''', '''pin''', and '''prong''' are also often used for "male" connectors, and '''receptacle''', '''socket''', and '''slot''' are used for "female" connectors. In many cases these terms are more common than ''male'' and ''female'', especially in documentation intended for the non-specialist. These nearly synonymous terms can cause a fair amount of confusion when the designations are shortened in labels.

For example, a female high-density [[D-subminiature]] connector with a size 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density D-sub with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density D-sub with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density D-sub with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.

===Gender selection in electronic design===
Electronic designers often select female jack connectors for fixed mounting on electronic equipment they design. This is usually done because female connectors are more resistant to damage or contamination, by virtue of their concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.

With an RS232 [[serial port]], the male connector is more fragile than the female connector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cost and reliability considerations probably drove the design decision to use female jack connectors on many computer terminals (and some personal computers) for the [[serial port]], in direct violation of the connector gender convention specified in the [[RS-232]] standard for "DTE" computer equipment. This confusing reversal of the RS-232 connector gender convention would cause many hours of frustration for ill-informed end users, as they tried to troubleshoot non-functional serial port equipment connections.

In the case of electrical power connections, designers do not reverse connector gender in such a casual fashion, because exposing live AC line power on male connectors is unsafe and generally illegal. Devices that need to be robust against mechanical damage use a special male [[IEC 60320 C14]] connector (see Gallery above), which is recessed below the surface of a mounting panel, providing the desired physical protection while conforming to safety regulations.

===Safety===
[[File:NEMA 5-15 Outlet 120V-15A.jpg|thumb|upright|Electrical power outlets are ''female'' for safety.]]

In electrical connections where [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] is sufficient to cause [[Electric shock|injury]], the part permanently connected to the power ''source'' is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of live conductors. A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device ''receiving'' the power.

In the case of consumer-level AC power, connector gender is used to implicitly enforce safe use of power connectors. Because of this consideration, it is illegal under [[electrical code]] to make or use any ''gender changers'' to connect AC line power to consumer-level equipment.

In [[Extra-low voltage|low-voltage]] use such as for [[telecommunication|data communications]], electrical shock hazard is not an issue, and male or female connectors are used based on other engineering factors such as convenience of use, cost, or ease of manufacturing. For example, the common [[Category 5 cable|"patch cables"]] used for [[Ethernet]] (and the similar cords used for [[telephone]]s) typically have male [[modular plug]]s on both ends, to connect to jacks on equipment or mounted in walls.

[[File:Hohlstecker und Hohlbuchse 5,5x2,5.jpg|thumb|left|Common 5.5×2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[coaxial power connector]]s. Power is provided by the ''female'' ''plug'' on the right to the ''male'' ''jack'' on the left; the exposed conductors are not hazardous due to the low voltage. See text for further explanation. &lt;!--It's also usually isolated, but that's a lot of explanation...--&gt;]]

As an illustrative example of some design tradeoffs in power connector selection, consider the adjacent picture. A commonly seen [[coaxial power connector]] is usually set up so that power is fed ''from'' the female plug on the right ''into'' the male jack on the left (which is typically a part of the electronic device accepting the power). Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]].

In this example, the marginal reliability of the connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies [[Extra-low voltage|low voltage]] that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the female plug would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.

===Ambiguous gender===
Some electrical connectors are [[hermaphroditic]] because they include both male and female elements in a single unit intended to interconnect freely, without regard for gender. See the discussion of [[#Genderless (hermaphroditic)|Genderless connectors]] elsewhere in this article for more detailed information.

As an additional complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations of male and female pins in a ''single'' connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector ''body'', rather than the mixed-gender connector ''pins'' and ''sockets''. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are ''not'' freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, '''mixed-gender'''. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).

Male connector pins are often protected by a '''shell''' (also called a '''shroud''', '''surround''', or '''shield'''), which may envelop the entire female connector when mated. [[RF connector]]s often have multiple layers of interlocking shells to properly connect the shields of [[Coaxial cable|coaxial]] and [[triaxial cable]]. In such cases, the gender is assigned based on the ''innermost'' connecting point.  With the exception of reverse polarity BNC or TNC, where the outer shell determines the gender and the innermost connecting points are opposite to a standard connector, for example a female RP-TNC connector has a solid innermost pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Know a Connector: RP-TNC|url=http://blog.showmecables.com/rp-tnc-connector/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ambiguous situation arises with the connectors used for [[USB]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE-1394), [[HDMI]], and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors reveals that the contact "pins" are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector ''as if'' it were a connector ''pin''. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are "female jacks".  A unique connector configuration where the contacts are hermaphroditic is the ELCO Varicon where the contacts are bifurcated and nest with one another axial at a 90 degree rotation in cross-shaped wells.  In this case the plugs had the contacts oriented transversely and the sockets longitudinally. 

A casual glance at a USB "Type A" plug connector may give the false impression that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB "Type A" cables with each other reveals the fact that the connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical [[graph theory]], USB buses are [[directed tree]]s, whereas FireWire buses have a true [[bus network]] topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.

==Genderless (hermaphroditic)==
[[Image:Train coupling.jpg|thumb|Paired "knuckle" type hermaphroditic mechanical [[Janney coupler|couplers]] for railcars (viewed from above)]]
[[Image:Arduino Protoboard Shields.jpg|thumb|[[Arduino]] "shield" boards connected via stackable bus connectors]]
By definition, a [[hermaphroditic]] connector includes mating surfaces having simultaneous male and female aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include '''hermaphrodite''', [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System|androgynous]], '''genderless''', '''sexless''', '''combination''' (or '''combo'''), '''two-in-one''', '''two-way''', and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, and should not be used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors should not be confused with ''mixed gender'' connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.

Another closely related type is the '''stackable connector''' for electronics, which typically has male pins on one surface, and complementary female sockets on the opposite surface, allowing multiple units to be stacked up like plastic [[milk crate]]s. Examples of this include stackable banana plugs, and interconnect cables specified for the [[IEEE-488]] instrumentation bus. '''Stackable mezzanine bus connectors''' are used on some modular microcomputer accessory boards for systems such as the [[Arduino]] add-on daughterboards called "shields". The older [[PC/104]] embedded PC modules use a similar stackable format for interconnection. Stackable connectors are not classified as hermaphroditic in the strictest sense, but are often described as such in looser usage.

The hermaphroditic design is useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, they can be connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have hermaphroditic connectors to prevent "wrong gender" connector problems in field deployments.&lt;ref name=Timbercon&gt;{{cite web|last=Timbercon|title=Hermaphroditic Fiber Optic Connectors|url=http://www.timbercon.com/hermaphroditic-connectors/|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AmphenolFiber&gt;{{cite web |last=Amphenol Fiber Systems International |title=TFOCA-III Fiber Optic Connectors |url=http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |accessdate=2011-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118185522/http://www.fibersystems.com/product_detail.aspx?pt=Products&amp;ProductID=60&amp;CategoryID=51 |archivedate=2011-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar fashion, [[railcar]]s are usually equipped with hermaphroditic [[railway coupling]] mechanisms that allow either end of the vehicle to be connected to a [[train]] consist without having to turn the railcar around first.
For the same reason, several [[spacecraft docking mechanism]]s are designed to be "androgynous",
including the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]], the [[NASA Docking System]], and [[Chinese Docking Mechanism]].

In the absence of genderless connectors, ''[[gender changer]]'' fittings might be used to enable certain connections. The designer of a connection system may use one or both schemes to allow arbitrary connectivity, or even combine both schemes into a single system.

When an enforced sense of unidirectionality or "one-way flow" is required for safety or other reasons (for example, AC electrical power connections), a strict assignment of connector genders is implemented to prevent undesired configurations, and gender changers are banned.

Some commonly seen examples of hermaphroditic connectors include the [[SAE connector]] for 12 V DC power, [[jackhammer]] air hose connectors, and the [[Anderson Powerpole]] series of modular high-current power connectors. The [[IBM]] [[token ring]] connector was another widespread example, but it has become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation ([[GenRad]]) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the "[[GR connector]]".

Some [[audio multicore cable]]s are fitted with hermaphroditic multipin quick-disconnect connectors for ease of use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirlwindusa.com/massdiff.html Whirlwind Technical Articles. ''Wiring MASS Connectors FAQ'']&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage to the user is that it does not matter which end connects to the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and which to the [[audio mixer]], facilitating faster set up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livesoundint.com/archives/2003/april/big/big.php Live Sound International. Archives, April 2003. ''Connect Corner: The ins and outs of multipin connector designs''. Peter Janis, Cabletek.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edac.net/product.html?ProductID=61 EDAC.

==Gender changers==
Devices used for mating two connectors of the same gender have a wide variety of terms, including for example: "[[gender changer]]", "gender mender", "gender bender", "gender blender", "sex changer", and "homosexual adapter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/gender-mender.html Jargon File: gender mender]&lt;/ref&gt; A specific gender changer can be referred to by either the gender of its connectors, or the gender which it is designed to connect to, resulting in a thoroughly ambiguous terminology. Thus a "male gender changer" might have female connectors to mate two male ends, or male connectors to mate two female ends.

Adding to this potential for confusion, some gender changers also combine additional functions such as [[Crossover_cable|cross-over]] pin-outs or even [[Active_cable|embedding micro-controllers]] for performance, or for [[Logic_level#Logic_voltage_levels|logic level]] or protocol adaptations, which would properly make them an [[Adapter_(computing)|adapter]], but this nomenclature is sometimes neglected in marketing materials or common parlance.

The '''German Orthographic Conference of 1901''' (the '''Berlin II Orthographic Conference'''; {{lang-de|Zweite Orthographische Konferenz}} or ''{{lang|de|II. Orthographische Konferenz}}'') took place in Berlin from 17th till 19 June 1901. The results of the conference became official in the [[German Empire]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Peter von Polenz: ''Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart – Band III – 19. und 20.

Teilband'' (''Hanbücher zur Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft'', Band 2.3), Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p. 2495 (chapter "Geschichte der Interpunktionssysteme im Deutschen").&lt;/ref&gt; 
The standardized [[German spelling]] that resulted from the conference was largely based on the [[Prussian]] school spelling, but also on the [[Orthographic Conference of 1876]].

The conference results removed numerous existing variant forms.
Soon after the conference, its results were criticized by people{{who|date=June 2015}} who believed there should be further changes.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

The spelling was used in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], apart from the replacement of ''[[ß]]'' with ''ss'' in Switzerland in later years.
The ''Erziehungsrat des Kantons Zürich'' stopped the teaching of ''ß'' in schools in 1935 with the Kanton Zürich being the first to do so, and the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' as last Swiss newspaper stopped using ''ß'' in 1974. However, some Swiss book publishers still use ''ß''.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Ammon: ''Die deutsche Sprache in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz. Das Problem der nationalen Varietäten''.

Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 496f.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 95 years later that the German spelling was changed with a [[German spelling reform of 1996|reform in 1996]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4859">'''Global Recordings Network''' (GRN) was founded by [[Joy Ridderhof]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1939 as "Gospel Recordings." The mission of GRN is "In partnership with the church, to effectively communicate the Good News of Jesus Christ by means of culturally appropriate audio and audio-visual materials in every language."  This is accomplished by recording the stories of the [[Bible]] in the native language or dialect,  by a mother tongue speaker and providing them in an audio format to the community.  Often the languages do not have a written form.  GRN has recorded over 6,000 languages or dialects.  GRN has offices in more than 20 countries.

The language professor [[Alexander Arguelles]] notes that it is possible to use these recordings and the accompanying text in a language the learner knows, to start learning any of the languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geographic Language Museum|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=Arguelles|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many there is no other way to learn the language. 1300 of the languages accompany the stories with standardized pictures, shown for 10-20 seconds, which allow learners to find short parallel sections in the language they know and the one they want to learn.&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalrecordings.net/en/goodnews |title="Good News" audio-visual |website=Global recordings network |language=en |access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idiom''' is the syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a [[language]].&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idiom is the realized structure of a language, as opposed to possible but unrealized structures that could have developed to serve the same [[semantic]] functions but did not.

Language grammar and syntax is often inherently arbitrary and peculiar to a particular language or a [[language family|group of related languages]]. For example, although in English it is ''idiomatic'' (accepted as structurally correct) to say "cats are associated with agility", other forms could have developed, such as "cats associate toward agility" or "cats are associated of agility".&lt;ref name="Garner_2016_headword_accompanied"&gt;{{Citation |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link=Bryan A. Garner |year=2016 |title=Garner's Modern English Usage |edition=4th |location=headword "accompanied" |url=http://www.lawprose.org/bryan-garner/books-by-bryan-garner/garners-modern-english-usage-4th-edition-2016/ |isbn=978-0190491482 |quote=Idiom requires ''accompanied by'', not ''*accompanied with''—e.g.: '[…] sliced in half and accompanied with [read ''accompanied by''] no more than a small scoop of ice cream.' |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unidiomatic constructions sound wrong to fluent speakers, although they are often entirely comprehensible. For example, the title of the classic book ''[[English As She Is Spoke]]'' is easy to understand (its idiomatic counterpart is ''English As It Is Spoken''), but it deviates from English idiom in the [[grammatical gender|gender]] of the pronoun and the [[inflection]] of the verb. [[Accidental gap|Lexical gaps]] are another key example of idiom.

==Emic and etic views==
[[Monolingual]] native speakers in an insulated monolingual-native environment are mostly not conscious of ''idiomaticness'' (the quality or state of a construction matching the idiom of the given language), because in general their minds never reach for, or hear, other possible structures. The main exception is when they hear the natural experimentation of children acquiring the language, when they may encounter, for example, [[overregularization]] (for example, ''I seed two deers'' for ''I saw two deer''). By this correlation, [[solecism]] to native-speaking monolingual minds often sounds childish. However, when adults study a foreign language, they become consciously aware of idiomaticness and the lack of it. For example, in English it is idiomatic to use an [[article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]] when describing a person's occupation (''I am '''a''' plumber''; ''she is '''an''' engineer''), but in Spanish and many other languages it is not (''soy plomero''; ''ella es ingeniera''), and a native speaker of English learning Spanish must encounter and accept that fact to become fluent.

The [[count noun|count]] [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''idiom'', referring to [[idiom|a saying with a figurative meaning]], is related to the present sense of the word by the arbitrariness and peculiarity aspects; the idiom "she is pulling my leg" (meaning "she is humorously misleading me") is idiomatic because it belongs, by convention, to the language, whether or not anyone can identify the original logic by which it was coined (arbitrariness), and regardless of whether it translates literally to any other language (peculiarity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15488">An '''interruption''' is a speech event when one person breaks in to interject while another person is talking. [[Linguistics|Linguists]], [[Social psychology|social psychologists]], [[anthropologist]]s, and [[Sociology|sociologists]] are among the [[Social science|social scientists]] who have studied and identified patterns of interruption that may differ by [[gender]], [[social status]], [[Race and ethnicity|race/ethnicity]], [[culture]], and [[political orientation]].

== Turn-taking and overlaps ==
[[Harvey Sacks]], the [[Sociology|sociologist]] who launched the field of [[conversation analysis]], worked with [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and Gail Jefferson in the 1970s to analyze how [[turn-taking]] was organized in speech events such as everyday conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sacks|first=Harvey|last2=Schegloff|first2=Emanuel A.|last3=Jefferson|first3=Gail|date=1974|title=A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation|jstor=412243|journal=Language|volume=50|issue=4|pages=696–735|doi=10.2307/412243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech events are organized so that only one person speaks at a time and to provide for orderly ways to change speakers. Sacks et al. thought that the process of turn-taking is [[subconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantrell, Lucy. 2013-14. "The Power of Rapport: An Analysis of the Effects of Interruptions and Overlaps in Casual Conversation." ''Innervate'' 6: 74-85. Accessed 03-11-18 at https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/documents/innervate/13-14/06-lucy-cantrell-q33103-pp-74-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Overlaps occur when two or more speakers talk simultaneously.

== Types of interruptions ==
Communication analyst Julia A. Goldberg uses [[conversation analysis]] to define three types of conversational interruptions. Relationally neutral interruptions are interjections by the listener that seek to repair, repeat, or clarify something the speaker just said. During this type of interruption, the interrupter does not intend to exert power over the speaker, or to establish rapport with the speaker. The act of interruption itself is understood as neutral in this instance. Another type of interruption defined by Goldberg is the power interruption, where the interrupter breaks in and cuts off the speaker as a way to display some social power. Power interruptions are understood as acts of conflict and competition, and are viewed as rude, hostile, disrespectful, and/or uncaring about the speaker and/or what the speaker is saying. A rapport interruption is designed to display mutuality and generally conveys the impression that the interrupter understands and empathizes with the speaker and/or the content of the speech, and is interpreted as collaborative and cooperative.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Julia A.|title=Interrupting the discourse on interruptions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-F|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=14|issue=6|pages=883–903|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power interruptions are also analyzed by Zimmerman and West, sociologists who note that the people who seek to be socially dominant exert their power over others through interrupting their speech. This can be seen in interactions between whites and racial/ethnic [[Minority group|minorities]], and between adults and children. Zimmerman and West also analyzed how [[Sex Roles|sex roles]] shape interruption patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zimmerman, Don. H., and Candace West. 1996. "Sex Roles, Interruptions and Silences in Conversation." ''Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science'' 4: 211-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender and interruption patterns ==
Since the late-1970s, social scientists have studied the effect gender has on interruption patterns and other components of verbal communication. The findings of these studies are mixed, with some finding gender differences, while others did not. Among those that found gender differences are sociologists Don Zimmerman and Candace West who used male dominance theory to claim that men interrupted women to assert their [[Social dominance theory|social dominance]] over females. Zimmerman and West's work discovered that interruptions were more evenly distributed in conversations involving same-sex speakers, while in cross-sex interactions, men were much more likely to interrupt women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|date=1979-06-01|title=Against Our Will: Male Interruptions of Females in Cross-Sex Conversation*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=327|issue=1|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Zhao and Gantz analyzed fictional TV shows to claim that male characters used disruptive interruptions more than female characters, while female characters more often used cooperative interruptions. They note, however, that the apparent gender differences in interruption patterns are affected by differences in [[social status]] among the TV characters.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Xiaoquan|last2=Gantz|first2=Walter|date=2003-06-01|title=Disruptive and Cooperative Interruptions in Prime-Time Television Fiction: The Role of Gender, Status, and Topic|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02595.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=347–362|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02595.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg notes that when conversational context and content are analyzed, interruptions may be seen as power displays, rapport displays, or as neutral acts that may or may not be shaped by the gender of the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Linguist Makri-Tsilipakou discovered that men and women use "simultaneous speech" at about the same rate, but the sexes differ as to their interpretation of the meaning of the interruption. Women use simultaneous speech as a sign of support and agreement, while men use it either as support for the other's speech or to dissent from other speakers or from their viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-04-01|title=Interruption revisited: Affiliative vs. disaffiliative intervention|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378216694900124|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=401–426|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(94)90012-4|issn=0378-2166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drass, a social psychologist, found that [[gender identity]], as separate from biological sex, was an important variable, with persons who were more male-identified being more likely to interrupt than persons who were more female-identified.

Conversely, a study by Murray and Covelli used Zimmerman and West's coding strategies on their own dataset of conversations to find that women interrupted men more often than men interrupted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|last2=Covelli|first2=Lucille H.|title=Women and men speaking at the same time|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-2166(88)90022-7|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(88)90022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James and Clarke, this pattern is especially evident in conversational situations where women felt more expertise, and thus may have felt that their interruptions were more legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;James, Deborah, and Sandra Clarke. 1993. Pp. 231-280 in ''Gender and conversational analysis.'' Edited by Deborah Tannen. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manterrupting ===
The term, [[:de:Manterruption|manterrupting]], was coined in early 2015 by Jessica Bennett in an article that appeared in ''Time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3666135/sheryl-sandberg-talking-while-female-manterruptions/|title=How Not to Be 'Manterrupted' in Meetings|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett defines the term as "[u]nnecessary interruption of a woman by a man." During the 2016 [[United States presidential debates|American presidential debates]], the term was applied to candidate [[Donald Trump]] who interrupted [[Hillary Clinton]] dozens of times during the first and second debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/4524162/donald-trump-manterruption-presidential-debate/|title=Donald Trump's Manterruptions Continue Uninterrupted at Second Presidential Debate|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction, the term has gained a significant presence on the internet as experts offer advice on how to avoid manterrupting and as [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] [[Blog|bloggers]] and commentators debate its applicability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 2017, [http://www.womaninterruptedapp.com/en/ Woman Interrupted], an app to track the [[gender]] of conversational partners was introduced. The app, which is free, is designed to assist men and women in recognizing and addressing manterrupting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-app-wants-to-help-women-track-how-often-theyre-manterrupted_us_58bec18de4b09ab537d6bee9|title=This App Wants To Help Women Track How Often They're 'Manterrupted'|last=Hatch|first=Jenavieve|date=2017-03-07|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and interruption patterns ==
Interruptions work as a status-organizing cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=Sally D.|last2=Ashcraft|first2=Amie M.|last3=Stasson|first3=Mark F.|last4=Nusbaum|first4=Rebecca L.|date=2010-12-01|title=Nonverbal Reactions to Conversational Interruption: A Test of Complementarity Theory and the Status/Gender Parallel|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-010-0091-0|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=193–206|doi=10.1007/s10919-010-0091-0|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, conversational participants use cues such as perceptions of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]], power, [[Social class|social class,]] gender, [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and age, to organize [[Communication in small groups|small group]] [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. Interruption patterns differ by social status, with persons of higher [[social status]], such as belonging to a social group who has more prestige or power, interrupting persons with lower status.&lt;ref name="Kollock 1985 34–46"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kollock|first=Peter|last2=Blumstein|first2=Philip|last3=Schwartz|first3=Pepper|date=1985|title=Sex and Power in Interaction: Conversational Privileges and Duties|jstor=2095338|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=1|pages=34–46|doi=10.2307/2095338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobi and Schweers analyzed transcripts of oral arguments made before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to find that senior justices interrupted their junior colleagues more frequently than the reverse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobi|first=Tonja|last2=Schweers|first2=Dylan|date=2017-10-24|title=Justice, Interrupted: The Effect of Gender, Ideology and Seniority at Supreme Court Oral Arguments|ssrn=2933016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kollock et al. studied conversations among couples, including male couples, female couples, and mixed sex couples. They found that partners who were considered to have more social power interrupted their partners more often, regardless of the gender composition of the dyad.&lt;ref name="Kollock 1985 34–46"/&gt; In TV shows, characters who are lower in the status hierarchy are scripted to display a "sense of defiance" that allows them to interrupt more aggressively than persons who hold a mid-level status.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study of interviews between physicians and patients found that physicians, who are considered to hold higher status than their patients in terms of prestige, are much more likely to interrupt their patients, regardless of the sex of the patient or the physician. Patients interrupted senior physicians at a higher rate than they interrupted doctors who were in training, indicating that the senior physicians are regarded as having a higher status than the their junior colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Menz, Florian, and Ali Al-Roubaie. 2008. "Interruptions, status and gender in medical interviews: the harder you brake, the longer it takes." ''Discourse &amp; Society'' 19(5): 645-666.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a study of physician-patient interactions among six different statuses, from low to high, indicated that patients tended to interrupt physicians more than the reverse, and that high and low status physicians did not differ in the number of times that they interrupted their patients. This study, by Irish and Hall, noted that status thus appears to be less of an indicator of the likelihood of interruptions among physicians and patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irish|first=J. T.|last2=Hall|first2=J. A.|date=September 1995|title=Interruptive patterns in medical visits: the effects of role, status and gender|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=41|issue=6|pages=873–881|issn=0277-9536|pmid=8571159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to social status affecting interruption patterns, interruptions also affect social status. In a study of mixed-sex and same-sex [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]], Farley discovered that the interrupters gained social status after they interrupted, while those who were interrupted lost social status. This study also found that people who interrupted also lost in terms of likeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=Sally D.|date=2008-12-01|title=Attaining Status at the Expense of Likeability: Pilfering Power Through Conversational Interruption|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-008-0054-x|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=241–260|doi=10.1007/s10919-008-0054-x|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race/ethnicity and interruption patterns ==
Zimmerman and West note that whites interrupt blacks as a strategy to exert their power and dominance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cultural differences ==
Interruptions, and how people interpret interruptions, differ by [[culture]] and [[language]]. Makri-Tsilpakou notes that some languages and cultures have higher tolerance for simultaneous talk, and that interpretations of interruptions may differ depending on cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi088/abstract|title=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction|last=Makri-Tsilipakou|first=Marianthi|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118611463|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118611463.wbielsi088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political orientation ==
Political [[Political spectrum|orientation]], e.g. where a person falls on the [[Conservatism|conservative]] to [[Liberalism|liberal]] political continuum, also shapes the likelihood that people will interrupt others or will be interrupted themselves. Jacobi and Schweers, in their study of transcripts of oral arguments made before the U.S. Supreme Court, found that conservative justices and advocates interrupt more often than liberals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An '''inventor''' is a person who creates or discovers a new method, form, device or other useful means that becomes known as an [[invention]]. The word ''inventor'' comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''invenire'', ''invent-'', to find.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=inventor&amp;db=* inventor]. Dictionary.com. Retrieved 1 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=invent invent].  Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 1 October 2017. &lt;/ref&gt; The system of [[patent]]s was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited [[monopoly]] on inventions determined to be sufficiently [[Novelty (patent)|novel]], [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obvious]], and [[Utility (patent)|useful]]. Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers nor scientists.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.britannica.com/topic/inventor Inventor].

'''Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children''' occurs when a child does not receive language exposure during their [[critical period]]. Language development can be severely delayed due to the lack of stimulation and socialization. This has been observed in such well known cases as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], [[Kaspar Hauser]], Anna{{which one|date=February 2018}}, and Isabelle{{which one|date=February 2018}}, as well as cases of feral children such as [[Victor of Aveyron|Victor]]. (All of those children had typical hearing.) Similarly, language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children may occur when sufficient language exposure does not occur within the first few years of life, the critical period of language development{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. This is common{{how often|date=February 2018}} because deaf children without hearing aids or cochlear implants cannot access the world around them through auditory means. These children often{{how often|date=February 2018}} arrive at preschool or kindergarten with significant language delays that can greatly impact the rest of their education{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Accommodations and specialized methods of instruction are required to meet the unique communication needs of deaf children, such as Auditory Verbal/Listening and Spoken Language therapy, cued speech, sign language, or a combination of approaches. Age of enrollment in early intervention services and strength of parental involvement are the strongest success indicators for language development in deaf children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moeller|first=Mary Pat|date=2000|title=Early Intervention and Language Development in Children who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing|url=http://mi-earlyoncenter-highered.wiki.educ.msu.edu/file/view/Early%20Intervention%20and%20Language.pdf/65382926/Early%20Intervention%20and%20Language.pdf|journal=Pediatrics|volume=106|issue=3|page=e43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical factors ==

=== Awareness ===
More than 90% of deaf and hard of hearing children are born to hearing parents, who may be unfamiliar with deafness and unsure about how to teach their children how to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kushalnagar|first=P., et al.|year=2010|title=Infants and Children with Hearing Loss Need Early Language Access|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3072291/#R1|journal=HHS Author Manuscripts|volume=21 |issue=2|pages=143–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many{{how many|date=February 2018}} doctors and [[Early childhood intervention|early intervention]] specialists have little experience with children with hearing loss and are not trained in best practices for their development.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Audiologists, otolaryngologists, speech-language pathologists, teachers of the deaf, and sign-language interpreters are the specialists who are trained and qualified to work specifically with deaf and hard-of-hearing children and their families on language development and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Early Hearing Detection and Intervention: Audiologists and SLPs Collaborate in Successful Program|last1=Roush|first1=Jackson|last2=Wilson|first2=Kathryn|last3=Alberg|first3=Joni|journal=The ASHA Leader|date=February 2008|volume=13|pages=14–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Access to language ===
Children with typical hearing in households where spoken language is the primary means of communication, or children with typical vision in signing households, are exposed to language at a young age. The critical period of language development occurs from birth and continues to age 5{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. During this period, the child develops language in structure such as syntax, social and brain development{{clarify|date=February 2018}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Friedmann, N., &amp; Rusou, D. (2015). Critical period for first language: the crucial role of language input during the first year of life. ''Current Opinion in Neurobiology'', ''35'', 27-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout a normal day, children with access to auditory signals are likely to continually receive input from TV, radio, surrounding conversations, and narration of events throughout their day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montag|first=J, et al.|date=Sep 2015|title=The words children hear: Picture books and the statistics for language learning|pmc=4567506|journal=Psychological Science|volume=26 |issue=9|pages=1489–1496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, children with typical vision in signing households are also exposed throughout the day to visual language. Through these avenues, children receive information about language structure, how we use language to interact with one another, and other cognitive and social cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saffran|first=J, et al.|date=2001|title=The acquisition of language by children|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/23/12874.full|journal=PNAS|volume=98 |issue=23|pages=12874–12875}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child is not exposed to language early, the child may develop language delays. This can be the case among deaf and hard of hearing children because this population can have limited access to language. Deaf children should be exposed to language early to avoid language delays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Early intervention services that provide language interventions to deaf and hard of hearing children can result in those children achieving language milestones at the same rates as their hearing peers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Early access to language provides a foundation for developing and acquiring other languages regardless of modality.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinaga-Itano, C. (2008). Lessons learned from universal newborn hearing screening. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Conference of Educational Administrators of Schools for the Deaf, Great Falls, MT. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinaga-Itano, C. (2006).

Marschark (Eds.), Advances in the spoken language development of deaf and hard of hearing children (pp. 298-327). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf and hard of hearing children who attend early intervention programs have a higher fluency in language by age five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deafchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ASDC-Article-VL2-Advantages-of-Early-Visual-Language.pdf|title=Advantages of Early Visual Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational placements  ===
{{globalize|date=February 2018}}
Deaf and hard of hearing children often{{how often|date=February 2018}} arrive to kindergarten at age 5 already significantly behind their hearing peers (in vocabulary development, social interactions, and other cognitive processes).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Due to hearing loss, some of these children cannot access language in the same way as their hearing peers. These approaches{{clarify|date=February 2018}} often assume{{weasel inline|date=February 2018}} that English is their [[first language]] (L1) and that these L1 foundations in English are already strong, having been set from birth to age 5.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Educational placements designed for hearing students can prove to be unsuccessful for DHH students, especially if those students haven't been previously exposed to auditory stimuli.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=T., et al.|year=2012|title=Language acquisition for deaf children: Reducing the harms of zero tolerance to the use of alternative approaches|pmc=3384464|journal=Harm Reduction Journal|volume=9:16.|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several types of educational placements for deaf and hard of hearing children, including: culturally [[Deaf education|deaf schools]]; [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstream general education classrooms]]; self-contained classrooms in public schools (a classroom that is designed for specifically for children with disabilities);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/self-contained-classrooms-3110850|title=Benefits of Self Contained Classroom for Special Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory Verbal, LSL, or OPTION schools for listening and spoken language;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.optionschools.org/|title=OPTION Schools - Home|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.optionschools.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[co-enrollment]] classrooms that contain both deaf and hearing children who use sign language and spoken language to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Stinson, M. S., &amp; Kluwin, T. N. (2011). Educational Consequences of Alternative School Placements. ''Oxford Handbooks Online''. doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199750986.013.000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communication approaches ==

=== Auditory Verbal/Listening and Spoken Language ===
The Auditory Verbal/Listening and Spoken Language (LSL) approach is a communication option for most infants, toddlers, and young children with hearing loss. This approach is generally used by parents who want their deaf child to listen and talk in the primary language of the home. The main principles of AV/LSL promote early detection and diagnosis of hearing loss, use of hearing technology such as hearing aids and cochlear implants to help children access sounds and spoken language, and early intervention services to guide and coach parents and caregivers on how to teach a child with hearing loss to listen and talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hearingfirst.org/lsl/what-is-lsl|title=What is Listening &amp; Spoken Language (LSL)?|website=hearingfirst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty percent of deaf children who have early and high-quality AV/LSL interventions can learn to listen and speak with the same skill level and fluency as their hearing peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avuk.org/facts-and-figures|title=Facts and figures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening and Spoken Language Specialists must be certified in LSL in order to use the LSLS designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agbell.org/Teach#lsls-certification|title=AG Bell &gt; Logon|website=www.agbell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilingual approaches ===
{{globalize|date=February 2018}}
These include approaches that use foundations in American Sign Language (ASL) to develop proficient reading and writing skills in English. [[Bilingual-bicultural education]] can also address the needs of those students who may be able to access spoken language as well. When ASL functions as the child's first language, some believe it can support second language acquisition, although there is no specific evidence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cummins, J. (2000). Language, power, and pedagogy: Bilingual children in the crossfire. Buffalo, NY: Multilingual Matters, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dickinson, D., Golinkoff, R., &amp; Hirsh-Pasek, K. (2010). Speaking out for language: Why language is central to reading development. Educational Researcher, 39 (4), 305-310. Data (pp. 881-938). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.Research in Child Language Disorders, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; Research done in bilingualism shows that if a child is fluent in a second language, it is due to proficiency in a first language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, most bilingual research has been conducted on bilingual unimodal (speaking and hearing) communicators, not on bilingual bimodal (signing and speaking) communicators. There is evidence that bilingual bimodal communicators using sign language and spoken language do not enjoy the [[cognitive advantages of bilingualism]] that bilingual unimodals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emmorey|first1=Karen, et al.|date=December 2008|title=The Source of Enhanced Cognitive Control in Bilinguals Evidence From Bimodal Bilinguals|journal=Psychological Science|volume=19|issue=12|pages=1201–06}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cued Speech ===

[[Cued Speech]] is a visual communication system that uses eight handshapes in four different placements near the face, in combination with the mouth movements of speech, to make the sounds of spoken language look different from each other. It can be used in conjunction with any of 56 spoken languages or dialects.

=== LEAD-K ===
LEAD-K stands for Language Equality &amp; Acquisition for Deaf Kids. It is a controversial effort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/07/19/fierce-debate-over-sign-language-use-by-some.html|title=Fierce Debate Over Sign-Language Use by Some Deaf Students|first=Christina|last=Samuels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2018}} in the United States intended to increase the number of deaf children who use American Sign Language. The LEAD-K initiative aims to "end language deprivation" by promoting American Sign Language, and by putting new laws in place to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing children begin learning both American Sign Language and English before kindergarten enrollment.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lead-k.org|title=Language Equality and Acquisition for Deaf Kids|website=Language Equality and Acquisition for Deaf Kids|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of LEAD-K is to promote a foundation for American Sign Language within deaf and hard of hearing children. The organization has drafted state-level legislative bills which passed in California, Kansas, Hawaii, and Oregon in 2015-2016. Versions of the bill have been proposed in at least twelve states since 2016, but all have failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;Tiggs, S. (n.d.). LEAD-K Bills and Deaf Child Bill of Rights.

'''[[Language policy]] in Ukraine''' is based on its [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]], international obligations, and from 2012 until February 2018 on the law "On the principles of the state language policy" (before 2012, the 1989 law "On the languages in the Ukrainian SSR" was in force).

The [[Ukrainian language]] is the state language of [[Ukraine]]. According to the article 10 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the State has to ensure the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine.
Other languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. Russian is recognized as the language of a national minority.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm#r1|title=Constitution of Ukraine: General Principles: Article 10|date=28 June 1996|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521190059/http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm|archivedate=21 May 2011}} of the Constitution says: "The state language of Ukraine is the Ukrainian language. The State ensures the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed."&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 law, called the law "On the principles of the state language policy" gave the status of [[regional language]] to Russian and other minority languages. It allowed the use of minority languages in courts, schools and other government institutions in areas of Ukraine where the national minorities exceed 10% of the population.&lt;ref name="Lsaid24812"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/lytvyn-program-for-development-of-ukrainian-language-should-be-adopted-before-elections-312012.html |title=Lytvyn: Program for development of Ukrainian language should be adopted before elections |date=2012-08-24 |work=[[KyivPost]] |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012/&gt; The law was used mostly in Ukraine's southern and eastern regions, where predominant or significant parts of the population speak Russian as their first language.&lt;ref name="Guardian4Jul2012" /&gt; Three minor settlements did the same for [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].&lt;ref name="NewUklang2892012" /&gt; Ukrainian remained the only official country-wide language.&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/04/ukrainians-protest-russian-language-law |title=Ukrainians protest against Russian language law |last=Elder |first=Miriam |date=2012-07-04 |work=theguardian.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduction of the law was supported by the governing [[Party of regions]] and opposed by the opposition parties.

Since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] and the independence of [[Ukraine]], the [[Russian language]] has dwindled, but remains one of the two most used languages for business, legal proceedings, science, artistry, and many other spheres of everyday life. According to the 2001 census, 67.5% of the citizens of Ukraine regard Ukrainian as their native language, with Russian being considered the native language for another 29.6%. Various other languages constitute the remaining 2.9%.&lt;ref&gt;http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/&lt;/ref&gt; During the Soviet era, both Russian and Ukrainian had official status as state languages of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name=oflangUSSR&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn3xDTiL0PQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=official+languages+Soviet+Union&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22official%20language%22&amp;f=false Language Policy in the Soviet Union] by [[L.A.

According to the article #27 (2nd part) it is necessary to translate Ukrainian place names into other languages using only Ukrainian [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] (the transcription of the [[Official language|state language]]).

On 9 February 2013  the authors of the 2012 language law, [[Serhiy Kivalov]] and [[Vadym Kolesnichenko]], were awarded the "[[Medal of Pushkin]]" by [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] for "great contribution to the preservation and promotion of the [[Russian language]] and [[Russian culture|culture]] abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://tsn.ua/politika/putin-nagorodiv-avtoriv-movnogo-zakonu-kivalova-ta-kolesnichenka-282799.html Регіонали удостоїлися медалі Пушкіна ''Regionals were awarded medal Pushkin''], [[TSN.ua]] (19 February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill "On the principles of the state language policy"==

===Analysis===
V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, refers to its support from various higher education bodies, scientists and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}Колесніченко B. [http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/kolesnichenko/4fb618767dc8f/ В Київському Національному університеті ім.

Some say that the bill contradicts the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], violates the [[Budget Code of Ukraine|Budget Code]], and aims to annihilate the [[Ukrainian language]]. It suffered a criticism in the conclusions of state authorities and their departments: the Main Scientific-Expert Bureau of the Ukrainian Parliament (23 May 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=41018 rada.gov.ua - Conclusions of the Main Scientific-Expert Bureau of the Ukrainian Parliament (23 May 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; the Parliamentary Committee on Culture and Spirituality (September 23, 2011), the Parliamentary Committee on Budget (3 November 2011), [[Ministry of Finance (Ukraine)|Ministry of Finance]] (9 September 2011), the [[Ministry of Justice (Ukraine)|Ministry of Justice]] (27 September 2011).&lt;ref name="maidan"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://maidan.org.ua/2012/07/67-instytutsij-hromadyanskoho-suspilstva-arhumentovano-zaklykaly-deputativ-ne-holosuvaty-za-pryjnyattya-zakonoproektu-pro-zasady-derzhavnoji-movnoji-polityky/ 67 institutions of public society reasonably urged deputies not to vote for adoption of the Bill on the principles of the state language policy]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also failed to obtain the support of the specialized institutions of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]: the Linguistics Institute, the Institute of the Ukrainian Language, the Institute of political and ethno-national researches, the Shevchenko Institute of Literature, the Institute of State and Law, the Ukrainian linguistic-informational Fund, the Philology Institute of [[Kiev University]], and the Academy of Sciences of the High School of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="maidan"/&gt;

===Opinion adopted by the Venice Commission===
In December 2011 the [[Venice Commission]] of the Council of Europe issued its Opinion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2011)047-e Opinion no.651/2011, European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), 19 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; on the draft law. According to [[Ukrayinska Pravda]], the [[Venice Commission]] did not notice in the draft law of Kolesnichenko any guarantees of the protection of the [[Ukrainian language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2011/12/17/6845714/ Венеціанська комісія не побачила у мовному законопроекті гарантій захисту української]&lt;/ref&gt; and later came to a decision that the bill is another "pre-election tool" for the [[Party of Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2011/12/20/6851586/ Венеціанська комісія звинуватила "регіоналів" у передвиборчих провокаціях]{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; V. Kolesnichenko, one of the authors of the law, claimed the 2011 analysis of the Venice Commission was "generally supportive".&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} В. Колесниченко [http://www.r-u.org.ua/akt/6409-news.html «Венецианская комиссия» впервые одобрила проект закона Украины «Об основах государственной языковой политики» (текст выводов)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703045852/http://www.r-u.org.ua/akt/6409-news.html |date=3 July 2012 }} [[Russian-speaking Ukraine]] 2011{{unreliable source?|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opponents noted that the analysis contained strong criticism, specifically about the failure to protect the role of Ukrainian as the State language.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.unian.ua/politics/584073-u-zakoni-pro-movnu-politiku-ne-garantovaniy-zahist-ukrajinskoji-movi.html unian.ua : У законі про мовну політику не гарантований захист української мови]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://glavcom.ua/articles/5666.html Скандальний висновок Венеціанської комісії щодо мови. Документ (glavcom.ua)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its Opinion, the [[Venice Commission]] stated, among other theses:

"It seems questionable to the Venice Commission that the parallel use of the State language and regional and minority languages, and in practice mostly the Russian language in large spheres of public life and not only on a local level, can still be considered to be in compliance with article 10 of the Constitution, as clarified by the Constitutional Court."

"the present draft does no longer formally focus on the Russian language, as the references to this language are almost always replaced by a reference to "the regional or minority language". This equalization of the treatment of the Russian language to the treatment of the regional or minority languages appears to be beneficial, in certain areas of public life, to other regional or minority languages" (Para. 64)

"…the question remains whether... there are sufficient guarantees, in the current Draft Law, for the consolidation of the Ukrainian language as the sole State language, and of the role it has to play in the Ukrainian multilinguistic society. The Venice Commission can only reiterate its call... for a fair balance between the protection of the rights of minorities, on the one hand, and the preservation of the State language as a tool for integration within society, on the other hand." (Para. 66)

"The recognition of linguistic freedom in the media and in the cultural area could moreover, due to market considerations, result in the dominance of the Russian language."

The Opinion also made other observations and proposals of change. It was of the view that "further improvements, increased guarantees and more substantial changes to the normative content of the Draft should be introduced..."

===Fight in parliament===
Prior to 24 May 2012 there were rumours that a revision of the legislation on languages would take place in parliament (the [[Verkhovna Rada]]) and that the Secretary of National Security and Defense would attend the session.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965229/ КЛЮЄВ ПРИЇХАВ ДО РАДИ ЛАМАТИ ДЕПУТАТІВ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some 1,000 protesters gathered just outside the [[Verkhovna Rada building]] setting up another tent city.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965236/ Під Радою ставитимуть намети]&lt;/ref&gt; State law enforcement warned the protesters not to establish a tent city.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965250/ Міліція попередила, що краще не ставити намети під Радою]&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters were yelling in Ukrainian "Get busy with work, not a tongue" (implying the law draft on languages).&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} {{YouTube|-ef149IYT1M|Video footage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some posters carried the slogan: "The problem is in poverty, not in language".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} {{YouTube|VrzdsndKTOc|Video footage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the evening session the parliamentary opposition in the Verkhovna Rada ([[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko|BYuT]] and Our Ukraine) blocked the main tribune in parliament as some representatives from the [[Party of Regions]] surrounded the [[presidium]]. The speaker was forced to announce a break in the session. After the break Member of Parliament [[Vyacheslav Kyrylenko]] read a statement of the united opposition not to conduct any hearings regarding language issues. After the law draft #10154 "On the state language of Ukraine" was not adopted onto the daily agenda, Kyrylenko withdrew his draft #9059 "Prohibition of narrowing the sphere of use of Ukrainian language" from a revision, while Kolesnichenko gave a presentation on his draft #9073. The head of the Committee On Issues of Culture and Spirituality [[Volodymyr Yavorivsky]] disclosed the decision of the committee to reject the bill #9073 as it was the decision of the committee's majority. He pointed to the fact that the law draft in fact will introduce a bilingual situation in number of regions. However, after a review the bill was supported by the parliamentary majority which showed its support in adopting two state languages: Ukrainian and Russian. The parliamentary minority and the deputy group "Reforms for the Future" stayed in opposition to the bill. Parliament speaker [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] was forced to hastily close&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965233/ ЛИТВИН ЗАКРИВ ЗАСІДАННЯ РАДИ НА ПІВСЛОВІ]&lt;/ref&gt; the session as further discussion descended into another scandalous fight&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965251/ Єфремов упевнений, що Колесніченко потрапив в історію]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving some members of parliament injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965235/ БЮТІВЦЯ ПОБИЛИ ДО КРОВІ.

The [[Party of Regions]] released a statement to the press where it accused the opposition of denying the adaptation of a bill that protects some constitutional rights of millions of citizens of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965255/ "Регіони" запевняють, що "шабаш" не завадить їм "захистити мову"]&lt;/ref&gt; PoR leader in parliament Yefremov promised to revisit the issue once everything is stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2012/05/24/6965246/ Лідер "Регіоналів" обіцяє, що мовою ще займуться]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The bill was to come into force only after it was signed by [[President of Ukraine|Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|Chairman of Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012/&gt; But the Chairman of Parliament [[Volodymyr Lytvyn]] tendered his resignation on 4 July 2012.&lt;ref name=Guardian4Jul2012/&gt; However, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] twice held votes of confidence in the speaker, and did not accept his resignation.&lt;ref name=Lytsign/&gt; On 31 July Lytvyn signed the law.&lt;ref name=Lytsign&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/language-law-comes-into-force-in-ukraine-311340.html Language law comes into force in Ukraine], [[Kyiv Post]] (10 August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed by President Yanukovych on 8 August 2012.&lt;ref name=Pessignedit&gt;{{ru icon}}[http://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/24960.html Президент подписал Закон и поручил Правительству создать рабочую группу] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121222070356/www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/24960.html |date=22 December 2012 }} 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into force on 10 August 2012.&lt;ref name=Lsaid24812/&gt; Since then various Ukrainian cities and regions have declared Russian a regional language in their jurisdictions,&lt;ref name=UkrCRdecRusregL&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/hot/language-bill/ See here for further information and news] by [[Kyiv Post]]&lt;/ref&gt; these being the municipalities of [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Kherson]], [[Mykolaiv]], [[Zaporizhia]], [[Sevastopol]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Luhansk]] and [[Krasnyi Luch|Krasny Luch]]; and the [[Oblasts of Ukraine|Oblasts]] of [[Odessa Oblast|Odessa]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast|Zaporizhia]], [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]], [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]], [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]].&lt;ref name="NewUklang2892012"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/romanian-becomes-regional-language-in-bila-tserkva-in-zakarpattia-region-313373.html |title=Romanian becomes regional language in Bila Tserkva in Zakarpattia region |date=2012-09-24 |work=Kyiv Post |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] has been made a regional language in the town of [[Berehove]] in [[Zakarpattia Oblast]], [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] in the village of [[Tarasivtsi]] ([[Chernivtsi Oblast]]),&lt;ref name=NewUklang2892012/&gt; and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] in the village of [[Rakhiv Raion|Bila Tserkva]]; also in Zakarpattia Oblast.&lt;ref name=NewUklang2892012/&gt; These languages will now be used in city/Oblast administrative office work and documents.&lt;ref name=NewUklang2892012/&gt; As of September 2012 there were no plans for such bilingualism in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/popov-no-bilingualism-in-kyiv-313178.html |title=Popov: No bilingualism in Kyiv |date=2012-09-19 |work=Kyiv Post |agency=Interfax-Ukraine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chairmen of the Supreme Council of Crimea]] [[Volodomyr Konstantinov]] stated in March 2013 that the August 2012 law had changed nothing in [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/03/27/6986562/ "Мовний" закон Колесніченка-Ківалова нічого не дав Криму ''"Language" law Kolesnichenko-Kivalov gave Crimea nothing''], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (27 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repeal of the law ===
{{see also|2014 Crimean crisis}}
On February 23, 2014, the second day after the flight of [[Viktor Yanukovich]], while in a parliamentary session, a deputy from the "[[Batkivshchina]]" party, [[Vyacheslav Kyrylenko]], moved to include in the agenda a bill to repeal the 2012 law "On the principles of the state language policy". The motion was carried with 86% of the votes in favour—232 deputies in favour vs 37 opposed against the required minimum of 226 of 334 votes. The bill was included in the agenda, immediately put to a vote with no debate and approved with the same 232 voting in favour. The bill would have made Ukrainian the sole state language at all levels.&lt;ref name=lenta223&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/23/language/ |title=На Украине отменили закон о региональном статусе русского языка |publisher=Lenta.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCRLLout&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26312008 |title=Ukraine: Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov named interim president |date=2014-02-23 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, all the minority languages (including Russian) remain explicitly protected under article 10 of the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Ukrainian Constitution]]. The repeal would also bring back into force the previous law on languages, which was in place in Ukraine for 23 years before July 2012 and was regulating the use of the minority languages. According to Uilleam Blacker, the repeal bill contained no specific threat to the Russian language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/uilleam-blacker/no-real-threat-to-ukraine%E2%80%99s-russian-speakers-language-law-ban No real threat to Ukraine's Russian speakers], Uilleam Blacker, 4 March 2014, opendemocracy.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euromaidanpr.com/2014/05/25/ukrainian-vs-russian-the-ban-that-never-was/ Ukrainian Vs Russian: The Ban That Never Was]&lt;/ref&gt;

However the move to repeal the 2012 law "On the principles of the state language policy" provoked negative reactions in [[Crimea]] and in some regions of [[Southern Ukraine|Southern]] and [[Eastern Ukraine]]. It became one of the topics of the protests against the new government approved by the parliament after the flight of [[Viktor Yanukovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.newsru.com/world/26feb2014/ukr_russian.html Новости NEWSru.com :: На Украине протестуют против начатой новыми властями борьбы с русским языком&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the next major development was the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]].

A '''language survey''' is conducted around the world for a variety of reasons.

*measuring people's ability to speak and understand another language (usually community based, not school based) ([[multilingualism]])
*studying people's attitudes about different languages (Rensch 1993)
*evaluating the differences and similarities in speech of communities that speak related speech forms, noting comprehension or collecting details of linguistic form ([[dialectology]]) (Labov 1982, Backstrom 1992,  Egland 1978)
*assessing the vitality of languages that may be disappearing ([[language death]]) (Statistic Canada 1993, Ferreira and Holbrook 2002)
*doing initial descriptions of languages in areas that are linguistically undescribed (King and King 1984)

== Methods ==
Methods used in language surveys depend on the questions that the survey is trying to answer.  Methods used include collecting word lists (Bender 1971), playing recorded texts to assess comprehension (Casad 1974), sentence repetition tests (Radloff 1991), questionnaires (Hochstetler and Tillinghast 1996), group and individual interviews, retelling of stories (McKinnies and Priestly 2004), direct observation (Cooper and Carpenter 1976),  and even internet surveys (tafesilafai.org).

As with any form of [[research]], the methods used depend on the questions that the researchers are trying to answer.  Also, the reliability of the results varies according to the method and the rigor with which it is applied, proper sampling technique, etc.

== Applications ==
The results of language surveys are use for a variety of purposes.  One of the most common is in making decisions for implementing educational programs.  The results have also been used for making decision for language development work (Holbrook, 2001).  And of course, academics are always interested in the results of any language survey.

== Agencies ==
Surveys have also been conducted by ethnic associations (Saskatchewan 1991), government agencies (Statistics Canada 1993),  NGO's (Toba, et al. 2002), foundations ([[Pew Hispanic Center]] 2004), etc.  Often such groups work together (Clifton 2002).  Some large and notable surveys include the Language Survey of India which was begun by [[George Abraham Grierson]]  late in the 19th century ([[Sociolinguistics research in India]]) and the Survey of Language Use and Language Teaching in East Africa, sponsored by the [[Ford Foundation]] from the 1960s.  Both resulted in a number of volumes describing locations of languages, patterns of multilingualism, language classification, and also included descriptions of languages, such as ''Language in Ethiopia'' ([[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Bender]], Bowen, Cooper, and [[Charles A. Ferguson|Ferguson]] 1976). The single agency conducting the most language surveys around the world is [[SIL International]] (Summer Institute of Linguistics).  The results of many of their surveys are posted on the web: http://www.sil.org/silesr.

== Sign languages ==
Surveys have usually been conducted among spoken languages.  However, surveys have also been done among users of [[sign language]]s (Vasishta, Woodward, and Wilson 1978,  Woodward 1991, 1993, 1996, Parkhurst &amp; Parkhurst 1998, Al-Fityani &amp; Padden 2008). As with surveys among spoken languages, surveys among sign languages have studied multilingualism, attitudes about various languages both spoken and signed (Ciupek-Reed 2012), differences and similarities between signed varieties (Aldersson and McEntee-Atalianis 2007, Bickford 1991, 2005, Parks 2011), and assessing the vitality of signed languages, and initial descriptions of undocumented sign languages.

The [[national language]]s of [[Seychelles]] are [[Seychellois Creole]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Seychellois Creole, a [[French-based creole language]], is by far the most commonly spoken language in the archipelago and is spoken natively by about 95% of the population. Nevertheless, the country was a [[British Empire|British colony]] for over a century and a half, and the legacy of [[History of Seychelles#British rule|British Seychelles]]) made English remain the main language in government and business.

French was introduced before the British rule. It has remained in use largely because it is used by the [[Franco-Seychellois]] minority and is similar to Seychellois Creole.

A '''lexicon''', '''word-hoard''', '''wordbook''', or '''word-stock''' is the [[vocabulary]] of a person, [[language]], or branch of [[knowledge]] (such as [[nautical]] or [[medical]]).  In [[linguistics]], a '''lexicon''' is a language's inventory of [[lexeme]]s. The word "lexicon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λεξικόν}} (''lexicon''), neuter of {{lang|grc|λεξικός}} (''lexikos'') meaning "of or for words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός] in Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Perseus Digital Library). Sc. βιβλίον "book").&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its [[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]); and a [[grammar]], a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include [[bound morpheme]]s, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most [[affix]]es).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OKvziaqXzXwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=morphemes+lexicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CB_0QMidAO&amp;sig=1YiUJnAc0kj-Pbh0V6duJhHPktg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl99OPt_TTAhWK0xoKHUolARo4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=morphemes%20lexicon&amp;f=false|title=Morphological structure, lexical representation, and lexical access|last2=Taft|first2=Marcus|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|last1=Dominiek|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some analyses, [[compound word]]s and certain classes of [[idiom]]atic expressions and other [[collocation]]s are also considered to be part of the lexicon. [[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, [[lexeme]]s are grouped into lemmas. A [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] is a group of lexemes generated by [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional morphology]]. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the [[citation form]]s and any [[English irregular verbs|irregular forms]], since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. [[Part of speech|Closed categories]], such as [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] or [[pronoun]]s, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily [[Syntax|syntactic]]. Open categories, such as [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
{{anchor#Lexicalization}}

A central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established ''lexical norms and conventions''. [[Lexicalization]] is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization&lt;ref name="Geert2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geert |first=Booij |title=The grammar of words : an introduction to linguistic morphology |series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-928042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], are often close semantically. Two examples are ''[[wikt:aptitude|aptitude]]'' versus ''[[wikt:attitude|attitude]]'' and ''[[wikt:employ|employ]]'' versus ''[[wikt:imply|imply]]''.&lt;ref name="Skeat 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRGhnkZq3HQC |date=2010-04-17 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=978-1-4400-5722-9 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornan |first=Uzzi |authorlink=Uzzi Ornan |title=The Final Word — Mechanism For Hebrew Word Generation |year=2003 |publisher=Haifa University Press |location=Haifa |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Allan |title=Predicting New Words — The Secrets of Their Success |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-13006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as ''slang'', ''branding''.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* [[Abbreviation]] of compounds.
* [[Acronyms]], the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as [[wikt:NASA|NASA]] and [[wikt:laser|laser (from "LASER")]].
* [[Inflection]], a morphology change with a category, such as number or tense.
* [[Morphological derivation|Derivation]], a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* [[Agglutination]], the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
[[Neologism]]s are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake.&lt;ref name="Jaeger2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Jeri J. |title=Kid's slips: what young children's slips of the tongue reveal about language development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YGd1FkRgAC |accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-3579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guestword (in German: ''Gastwort''): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: ''Fremdwort''): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: ''Lehnwort''): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using [[Target language (translation)|target language]] lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'', by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phono-semantic matching]] (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves [[Generative grammar|generative]] devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] "-able" is usually only added to [[transitive verb]]s, as in "readable" but not "cryable".

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through [[analogy]], [[Pragmatics|common sense and, most commonly, context]].&lt;ref name="Geert2005" /&gt; Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound.&lt;ref name="Maity2016"&gt;Suman Kalyan Maity, Ritvik Saraf and Animesh Mukherjee (2016). #Bieber + #Blast = #BieberBlast: Early Prediction of Popular Hashtag Compounds. In ''ACM CSCW'', San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. 

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism.

* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Phonological assimilation]], the modification of loanwords to fit a new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too "foreign", inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* [[Analogy]], where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Emphasis]], the modification of words' stress or accenting.
* [[Metaphor]], a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
{{main|Bilingual lexical access}}

The term "lexicon" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants ([[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]], for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a ''[[wikt:cash dispenser|cash dispenser]]'' (British English) as well as an  [[wikt:automatic teller machine|automatic teller machine]] or [[wikt:ATM|ATM]] in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/[[concept]] relationship; [[lexical access]] and lexical access failure; how a word's [[phonology]], [[syntax]], and meaning intersect; the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use ([[pragmatics]]); [[language acquisition]]; the history and evolution of words ([[etymology]]); and the relationships between words, often studied within [[philosophy of language]].

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

'''Linguistics''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Language and Linguistics |first=Michael A.K. |last=Halliday |authorlink=Michael Halliday |author2=Jonathan Webster | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8824-2 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it involves an analysis of language [[Theoretical linguistics|form]], language [[Semantics|meaning]], and language in [[context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref name="Martinet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of General Linguistics |last=Martinet |first=André |authorlink=André Martinet |translator=Elisabeth Palmer Rubbert |series=Studies in General Linguistics, vol. i. |location=London |publisher=Faber |year=1960 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest activities in the [[language documentation|documentation]] and [[descriptive linguistics|description of language]] have been attributed to the 6th century BC [[India]]n grammarian [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present|author=Rens Bod|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199665214|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KaOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter =Chapter VI: Sanskrit Literature|title = The Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume = 2 |date=1908|page = 263|url =https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette02hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a formal description of the [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit language]] in his ''{{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyī}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini (2 Vols.) |author=S.C.

Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between [[phonetics|sound]] and [[semantics|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning |first=Roman |last=Jakobson |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1937 |isbn=0262600102 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/jakobson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phonetics]] is the study of speech and non-speech sounds, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties. The study of language [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], on the other hand, deals with how languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey, process, and assign meaning, as well as manage and resolve [[ambiguity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakyapadiya: Sphota, Jati, and Dravya |author=Sharada Narayanan |year=2010 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/power-of-the-word/article3779772.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the study of [[semantics]] typically concerns itself with [[truth condition]]s, [[pragmatics]] deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 9780262531641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound&lt;ref&gt;All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn =0-262-51370-6|url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240 |edition= 6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A. Demers |author3=Ann K. Farmer |author4=Robert M. Harnish |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s framework of [[generative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'' (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] distinguished between the notions of [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his formulation of [[structural linguistics]]. According to him, [[speech|''parole'']] is the specific utterance of speech, whereas [[language|langue]] refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). ''Course in general linguistics'' (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction resembles the one made by [[Noam Chomsky]] between [[linguistic competence|competence]] and [[Linguistic performance|performance]] in his theory of [[generative grammar|transformative]] or [[universal grammar|generative grammar]]. According to Chomsky, competence is an individual's innate capacity and potential for language (like in Saussure's ''langue''), while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals, groups, and communities (i.e., ''parole'', in Saussurean terms).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''parole'' (which manifests through cultural [[discourse (linguistics)|discourses]] and [[dialects]]) is the domain of [[sociolinguistics]], the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain [[speech community]] (governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws). [[Discourse analysis]] further examines the structure of texts and [[conversations]] emerging out of a speech community's usage of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociolinguistic Discontinuity in Minority Language Communities |pages=40–55 |year=1998 |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |author1=Raymond Mougeon |author2=Terry Nadasdi |lastauthoramp=yes|jstor=417564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of [[corpus linguistics]], which takes naturally occurring [[Text (disambiguation)|texts]] and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).

[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title="Stylistics" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Antonsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like [[psycholinguistics]], which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; [[neurolinguistics]], which studies language processing in the brain; [[biolinguistics]], which studies the biology and evolution of language; and [[language acquisition]], which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.

Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/jlp/main Journal of Language and Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; Research on language through the sub-branches of [[historical linguistics|historical]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] also focus on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended [[diachronic linguistics|period of time]].

[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] – the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.

Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of [[semiotics]] (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), [[literary criticism]] (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), [[translation]] (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and [[speech-language pathology]] (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] level).

==Nomenclature==
Before the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"&gt;{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.&lt;ref name="Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G. Nichols (Vol. 65, No. 1 (Jan 1990), pp. 1-10. Published by Medieval Academy of America."&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture |first=Stephen G. |last=Nichols |journal=Speculum |volume=65 |number=1 |year=1990 |pages=1–10 |jstor=2864468 |doi=10.2307/2864468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=19 |isbn=0-521-44665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]], however, this focus has shifted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=9 |isbn=0-521-44665-1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''philology'' is now generally used for the "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in the United States&lt;ref&gt;A. Morpurgo Davies Hist. Linguistics (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the "science of language").&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"/&gt;

Although the term "linguist" in the sense of "a student of language" dates from 1641,&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"/&gt; the term "linguistics" is first attested in 1847.&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"&gt;{{OEtymD|linguist|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} though ''linguistic science'' is sometimes used.

Linguistics is a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA13|title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics|last=Spolsky|first=Bernard|last2=Hult|first2=Francis M.|date=February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781444331042|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA23|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|last=Berns|first=Margie|date=2010-03-20|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080965031|location=|pages=23–25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/science-linguistics|title=The Science of Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Linguistic Society of America|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17|quote=Modern linguists approach their work with a scientific perspective, although they use methods that used to be thought of as solely an academic discipline of the humanities. Contrary to previous belief, linguistics is multidisciplinary. It overlaps each of the human sciences including psychology, neurology, anthropology, and sociology. Linguists conduct formal studies of sound structure, grammar and meaning, but they also investigate the history of language families, and research language acquisition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many linguists, such as David Crystal, conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistics|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1990|isbn=9780140135312|authorlink=David Crystal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''linguist'' applies to someone who studies [[language]] or is a researcher within the field, or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages.&lt;ref name="American Heritage 2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Linguist|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2000|isbn=978-0-395-82517-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation and universality ==
While some theories on linguistics focus on the different varieties that language produces, among different sections of society, others focus on the [[universal grammar|universal]] properties that are common to all human languages. The theory of variation therefore would elaborate on the different usages of popular languages like [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] across the globe, as well as its smaller [[dialects]] and regional permutations within their national boundaries. The theory of variation looks at the cultural stages that a particular language undergoes, and these include the following.

===Pidgin===

The pidgin stage in a language is a stage when communication occurs through a grammatically simplified means, developing between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. Typically, it is a mixture of languages at the stage when there occurs a [[mixed language|mixing]] between a primary language with other language elements.

===Creole===

A creole stage in language occurs when there is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages. It is a stage that occurs after a language undergoes its pidgin stage. At the creole stage, a language is a complete language, used in a community and acquired by children as their native language.

===Dialect===
A dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].

[[Universal grammar]] takes into account general formal structures and features that are common to all dialects and languages, and the template of which pre-exists in the mind of an infant child. This idea is based on the theory of generative grammar and the formal school of linguistics, whose proponents include [[Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and those who follow his theory and work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&amp;nbsp;– they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes."&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Discourse===
Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept.  As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on.

===Standard language===

When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.

The study of a language's universal properties, on the other hand, include some of the following concepts.

===Lexicon===
The [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |pages=2ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.

It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.

===Relativity===
As constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through [[deconstructivism|deconstruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing and Difference |author=Jacques Derrida |translator=Alan Bass |year=1978 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226143293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was even heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death for his theory of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.

Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten."  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth" is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.

Linguistics has many sub-fields concerned with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, is known as [[generative linguistics|generative theory]] or [[universal grammar]]. These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run the gamut of level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.

===Grammar===

Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following.

* '''[[Phonetics]]''', the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
* '''[[Phonology]]''', the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning ([[phonemes]])
* '''[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]''', the study of [[morphemes]], or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* '''[[Syntax]]''', the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]
* '''[[Semantics]]''', the study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of sentences
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''', the study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]], and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* '''[[Discourse analysis]]''', the analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* '''[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]]''', the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
* '''[[Semiotics]]''', the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication

===Style===
[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] is the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.

==Approaches==

===Theoretical===
One major debate in linguistics concerns the very nature of language and how it should be understood. Some linguists hypothesize that there is a [[language module|module]] in the [[human brain]] that allows people to undertake linguistic behaviour, which is part of the [[formal grammar|formalist]] approach. This "[[universal grammar]]" is considered to guide children when they learn language and to constrain what sentences are considered grammatical in any human language. Proponents of this view, which is predominant in those schools of linguistics that are based on the [[generative linguistics|generative]] theory of [[Noam Chomsky]], do not necessarily consider that language evolved for communication in particular. They consider instead that it has more to do with the process of structuring human thought (see also [[formal grammar]]).

===Functional===
Another group of linguists, by contrast, use the term "language" to refer to a communication system that developed to support [[cooperation|cooperative activity]] and extend cooperative networks. Such [[functional theories of grammar|theories of grammar]], called "functional", view language as a tool that emerged and is adapted to the communicative needs of its users, and the role of [[cultural evolution]]ary processes are often emphasized over that of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss  | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Linguistics is primarily [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]].&lt;ref name="Martinet" /&gt; Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "[[acrolect]]". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the [[teaching of language]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.

===Anthropology===
The objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, now, linguistic inquiry uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.

===Sources===
Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because
* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;
* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;
* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;
* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;
* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].

Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.

The study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.

===Analysis===
Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.

At another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.

==History==
{{main|History of linguistics}}

===Early grammarians===
{{main|Philology|History of English grammars}}

The formal study of language began in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|الكتاب في النحو}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "[[grammar]]" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "[[Art of Grammar|téchnē grammatikḗ]]" ({{script|Grek|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M.  |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-blackwell|isbn=0-631-20891-7|pages=2–24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as [[Roger Ascham]], [[Wolfgang Ratke]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative philology===
In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield attributes "the first great scientific linguistic work of the world" to [[Jacob Grimm]], who wrote ''Deutsche Grammatik''.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{main|Structuralism (linguistics)}}
Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|langue- parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue'') from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Semiotic: Readings with Commentary from Antiquity to the Present |first=David S. |last=Clarke |year=1990|location=Carbondale|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|pages=143–144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vZDmu_4_CUC&amp;pg=PA143 |isbn=9780809316144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a structural approach to language came from [[Prague school (linguistics)|The Prague school]], [[Leonard Bloomfield]], [[Charles F. Hockett]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref name="Holquist81"&gt;{{harvnb|Holquist|1981|pp=xvii–xviii}}.{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Course in General Linguistics |first=Ferdinand |last=de Saussure |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-8022-1493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generativism===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}
During the last half of the 20th century, following the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], linguistics was dominated by the [[Generative grammar|generativist school]]. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a way to explain how human beings [[language acquisition|acquire language]] and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is [[Language module|modularist]] and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of [[Zellig Harris]] to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]], and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.

In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Three Models for the Description of Language | journal = [[IRE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 113 123 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky1957"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Syntactic Structures | publisher = [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton]] | location = The Hague | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:

* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'', none of which appear in strings formed from ''G''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''production rules'', that map from one string of symbols to another.
A formal description of language attempts to replicate a speaker's knowledge of the rules of their language, and the aim is to produce a set of rules that is minimally sufficient to successfully model valid linguistic forms.

===Functionalism===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[Formal grammar|formal theories of grammar]], in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|quote=[Functional grammar] analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyses the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approach is not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formulae and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.13.100184.000525|pages=97–117|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional theories describe language in term of the functions existing at all levels of language.
*Phonological function: the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between different lexical material.
*Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
*Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression
*Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic–comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction. Functional descriptions of grammar strive to explain how linguistic functions are performed in communication through the use of linguistic forms.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{main|Cognitive linguistics}}
Cognitive linguistics emerged as a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like [[Ronald Langacker]] and [[George Lakoff]], cognitive linguists propose that language is an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of basic, general-purpose cognitive processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, cognitive linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in cognitive linguistics include [[cognitive grammar]], [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], and [[conceptual metaphor]], all of which are based on the idea that form–function correspondences based on representations derived from [[embodied cognition|embodied experience]] constitute the basic units of language.

Cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of concepts (sometimes universal, sometimes specific to a particular tongue) that underlie its form. It is thus closely associated with [[semantics]] but is distinct from [[psycholinguistics]], which draws upon empirical findings from cognitive psychology in order to explain the mental processes that underlie the acquisition, storage, production and understanding of speech and writing.  Unlike generative theory, [[cognitive linguistics]] denies that there is an ''autonomous linguistic faculty'' in the mind; it understands grammar in terms of ''conceptualization''; and claims that knowledge of language arises out of ''language use''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author1=Croft, William  |author2=D. Alan Cruse |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its conviction that knowledge of language is learned through use, cognitive linguistics is sometimes considered to be a functional approach, but it differs from other functional approaches in that it is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language, and not with the use of language as a tool of communication.

==Areas of research==

===Historical linguistics===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] study the history of specific languages as well as general characteristics of language change. The study of language change is also referred to as "diachronic linguistics" (the study of how one particular language has changed over time), which can be distinguished from  "synchronic linguistics" (the comparative study of more than one language at a given moment in time without regard to previous stages). Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. However, there was a shift to the synchronic approach in the early twentieth century with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], and became more predominant in western linguistics with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]].

===Ecolinguistics===
[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.

===Developmental linguistics===
[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.

===Neurolinguistics===
[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mariën|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101–103|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied linguistics==
{{Main|Applied linguistics}}
Linguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0194374440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)

Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.

Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503–526 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt;

==Interdisciplinary fields==
Within the broad discipline of linguistics, various emerging sub-disciplines focus on a more detailed description and analysis of language, and are often organized on the basis of the school of thought and theoretical approach that they pre-suppose, or the external factors that influence them.

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of "sign" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204–225 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.

===Language documentation===
Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.

The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelman, Nikolaus "Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann &amp; Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across mediums, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations, such as travel agencies as well as governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]] for example, which is an automated, programmed facility to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic Translators, specialize and semi specialize on various other disciplines such as; Technology, Science, Law, Economics etc.

===Biolinguistics===
[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.

===Clinical linguistics===
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the fields of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to cure [[communication disorders]] and swallowing disorders

Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders, like rhyming inappropriately, have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient, shown a colour chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'

However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.&lt;ref&gt;Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational linguistics===
[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.

===Evolutionary linguistics===
[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234  | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic linguistics===
[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates on the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also contributed expertise in criminal cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''''Michaelis''''' is a brand of [[dictionary|dictionaries]] of the [[portuguese language]] published in [[Brasil]] by [[Melhoramentos publishing company]]. There are also under this brand books about the grammar of a variety of foreign languages. The first Michaelis dictionary was created by the end of the 19th century by the German lexicographer [[Henriette Michaelis]], in a partnership with her sister [[Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcelos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelis.uol.com.br/|title=Sobre o dicionário {{!}} Michaelis On-Line|website=Michaelis On-Line|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictionary has versions in the following languages:
* Portuguese
* [[English (language)|English]]
* [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]
* [[Italian (language)|Italian]]
* [[French (language)|French]]
* [[German (language)|German]]
* [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]

== Controversy ==
In July 2015, an online petition was created on Change.org demanding the dictionary to review the definition of "marriage". The definition was, among others, a "legitimate union between man and woman". The petition requested that the word "people" were used instead of "man" and "woman". The petition got more than three thousand endorsements. The director of Melhoramentos abided by and made the requested changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/tecnologia/noticia/2015/07/dicionario-michaelis-muda-verbete-de-casamento-apos-pressao-online.html|title=Dicionário Michaelis muda verbete de casamento após pressão online|date=2015-07-02|work=Tecnologia e Games|access-date=2017-11-08|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first Mundo Lingo event was an initiative of UK born Benji Moreira when he was an immigrant in [[Buenos Aires]] ([[Argentina]]). It took place on July 7, 2011 and was aimed for local Argentines to learn foreign languages and for internationals to practice Spanish.
After a while, around 50 people per week were attending and the flag system was introduced. In 2014 the event grew increasingly popular and was exported to Cologne, London, Montreal, and then Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mundolingo.org/history |title= History of Mundo Lingo|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2016|website= mundolingo.org  |access-date= 5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many accounts of the '''[[origin of language]]''' in the world's '''[[mythology|mythologies]]''' and other stories pertaining to the origin of language, the development of language and the reasons behind the diversity in languages today.

These myths have similarities, recurring themes, and differences, having been passed down through [[oral tradition]]. Some myths go further than just storytelling and are religious, with some even having a literal interpretation even today. Recurring themes in the myths of language dispersal are floods and catastrophes. Many stories tell of a great [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] or flood which caused the peoples of the Earth to scatter over the face of the planet. Punishment by a god or gods for perceived wrongdoing on the part of man is another recurring theme.

Myths regarding the origins of language and languages are generally subsumed or footnoted into larger [[creation myth]]s, although there are differences. Some tales say a [[Creator deity|creator]] endowed language from the beginning, others count language among later gifts, or curses.

==Hebrew Bible==
{{main|Adamic language|Tower of Babel#Confusion of tongues}}
{{further|Tower of Babel}}
[[File:Confusion of Tongues.png|right|thumb|The "[[confusion of tongues]]" by [[Gustave Doré]], a [[woodcut]] depicting the [[Tower of Babel]] from [[Abrahamic]] myth.]]
The [[Hebrew Bible]] attributes the origin of language per se to humans, with Adam being asked to name the creatures that God had created.

One of the most well known examples in the West is the [[Tower of Babel]] passage from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. 
It tells of [[YHWH|God]] punishing [[Human beings|humanity]] for arrogance and disobedience by means of the [[confusion of tongues]].

:And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
:Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  (Genesis 11:5-6, [[KJV]] translation)

This became the standard account in the European Middle Ages, reflected in medieval literature such as the tale of [[Fénius Farsaid]].

==India==
[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As ''[[brahman]]'' "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s".
She is presented as the consort of [[Prajapati]], who is likewise presented as the origin of the Veda.&lt;ref&gt;"Veda, Prajāpati and Vāc" in Barbara A. Holdrege, 'Veda in the Brahmanas', in: Laurie L. Patton (ed.) ''Authority, anxiety, and canon: essays in Vedic interpretation'', 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1937-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She became conflated with [[Sarasvati]] in later Hindu mythology.

==Americas==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|right|Doré's "The Deluge". Man and beast take refuge on an isolated rock during the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], a feature of [[creation myth]]s from around the world.]]
In common with the mythology of many other civilizations and cultures which tell of a [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes tell of a deluge which came over the Earth. After the water subsides, various explanations are given for the new diversity in speech.

===Mesoamerica===
The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survive, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begot many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]] were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
A similar flood is described by the [[Kaska]] people from North America, however, like with the story of Babel, the people were now "widely scattered over the world". The narrator of the story adds that this explains the many different centres of population, the many tribes and the many languages, "Before the flood, there was but one centre; for all the people lived together in one country, and spoke one language."&lt;ref&gt;Teit, J. A. (1917) "Kaska Tales" in ''Journal of American Folklore'', No. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

:They did not know where the other people lived, and probably thought themselves the only survivors. Long afterwards, when in their wanderings they met people from another place, they spoke different languages, and could not understand one another.

An [[Iroquois]] story tells of the god [[Taryenyawagon]] (''Holder of the Heavens'') guiding his people on a journey and directing them to settle in different places whence their languages changed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E. [http://www.library.jbsheets.com/america/LegendsTraditionsandLawsoftheIroquois.htm Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of the Tuscarora Indians] (Access date: 4 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Salishan]] myth tells how an argument led to the divergence of languages.  Two people were arguing whether the high-pitched humming noise that accompanies ducks in flight is from air passing through the beak or from the flapping of wings.  The argument is not settled by the chief, who then calls a council of all the leading people from nearby villages.  This council breaks down in argument when nobody can agree, and eventually the dispute leads to a split where some people move far away.  Over time they slowly began to speak differently, and eventually other languages were formed.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, F. (ed.) (1917) "The Origin of the Different Languages". ''Folk-Tales of Salishan and Sahaptin Tribes'' (New York: American Folk-Lore Society)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of the [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]], [[indigenous people of California]], a creator, accompanied by [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] creates language as he creates the tribes in various localities. He lays sticks which will transform into people upon daybreak.

:Then follows a long journey of the creator, still accompanied by Coyote, in the course of which he makes tribes in different localities, in each case by laying sticks in the house over night, gives them their customs and mode of life, and each their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, A. L. (1907) "Indian Myths of South Central California" in ''American Archaeology and Ethnology'', Vol. 4, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazonas, Brazil===
The [[Ticuna people]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Upper Amazon]] tell that all the peoples were once a single tribe, speaking the same language until two hummingbird eggs were eaten, it is not told by whom. Subsequently the tribe split into groups and dispersed far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro, R. (2000) "Origin Myths" in ''California Journal of Science Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

In [[Ancient Greece]] there was a myth which told that for ages men had lived without law under the rule of [[Zeus]] and speaking one language, gifted to them by the god and goddess of ingenuity, Philarios and Philarion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966398472|title=Multilingualism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Maher, John C.,|isbn=9780198724995|edition= First |location=Oxford|oclc=966398472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Hermes]] brought diversity in speech and along with it separation into nations and discord ensued. Zeus then resigned his position, yielding it to the first king of men, [[Phoroneus]].

In [[Norse mythology]], the faculty of speech is a gift from the third son of [[Borr]], [[Vé]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vili and Vé]]&lt;/ref&gt; who gave also hearing and sight.

:When the sons of [[Borr]] were walking along the sea-strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight.

==Africa==
The Wa-Sania, a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people of [[East Africa]]n origin have a tale that in the beginning, the peoples of the earth knew only one language, but during a severe [[famine]], a madness struck the people, causing them to wander in all directions, jabbering strange words, and this is how different languages came about.

A god who speaks all languages is a theme in [[African mythology]], two examples being [[Eshu]] of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], a trickster who is a messenger of the gods. Eshu has a parallel in [[Legba]] from the Fon people of [[Benin]]. Another [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] god who speaks all the languages of the world is [[Orunmila]], the god of [[divination]].

==Southeast Asia and Oceania==

===Polynesia===
A group of people on the island of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]] in [[Polynesia]] tell a very similar story to the Tower of Babel, speaking of a God who, "in anger chased the builders away, broke down the building, and changed their language, so that they spoke diverse tongues".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, R. W. (1933) ''Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia'' (Cambridge), vol. I, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[South Australia]], a people of [[Encounter Bay]] tell a story of how diversity in language came about from [[cannibalism]]:

:In remote time an old woman, named Wurruri lived towards the east and generally walked with a large stick in her hand, to scatter the fires around which others were sleeping, Wurruri at length died. Greatly delighted at this circumstance, they sent messengers in all directions to give notice of her death; men, women and children came, not to lament, but to show their joy. The Raminjerar were the first who fell upon the corpse and began eating the flesh, and immediately began to speak intelligibly. The other tribes to the eastward arriving later, ate the contents of the intestines, which caused them to speak a language slightly different. The northern tribes came last and devoured the intestines and all that remained, and immediately spoke a language differing still more from that of the Raminjerar.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, H. E. A., (1879) "Manners and Customs of the Aborigines of the Encounter Bay Tribe", published in Wood, D., et al., ''The Native Tribes of South Australia'', (Adelaide: E.S. Wigg &amp; Son) (available online [http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//SAhistory/Meyer.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of [[Australian Aboriginal]] people, the [[Gunwinggu]], tell of a goddess in [[dreamtime]] giving each of her children a language of their own to play with.

===Andaman Islands===
The traditional beliefs of the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] describe language as being given by the god [[Pūluga]] to the first man and woman at their union following a great deluge. The language given was called ''bojig-yâb-'', which is the language spoken to this day, according to their belief, by the tribe inhabiting the south and south-eastern portion of middle [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. This language is described by the inhabitants as the "mother tongue" from which all other dialects have been made.

Their beliefs hold that even before the death of the first man,

:... his offspring became so numerous that their home could no longer accommodate them. At Pūluga's bidding they were furnished with all necessary weapons, implements, and fire, and then scattered in pairs all over the country. When this exodus occurred Puluga- provided each party with a distinct dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Man, E. H. (1883) "On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands. (Part II.)" in ''The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 12, pp. 117–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus explaining the diversity of language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8309">'''The National Center for Voice and Speech''' (NCVS), is a multi-site research and teaching organization dedicated to studying the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech. The NCVS is located in Salt Lake City, Utah with the Lead Institution located at the University of Utah. NCVS is also a Center at the [[University of Iowa]] where it has laboratories in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology.  In addition, the NCVS has collaborators in Denver and at many institutions around the United States.  Its focus is [[vocology]], or the science and practice of voice habilitation.&lt;ref&gt;van Mersbergen M et al. (2001). "Preparation of the speech-language pathologist specializing in voice: an educational survey.", J Voice. 15(2):237-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall.  {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially conceived as a "center without walls," the NCVS was formally organized in 1990 with the assistance of a grant from the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] (NIDCD), an institute of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The NCVS was organized on the premise that a consortium of institutions (including the Wilber James Gould Voice Center at the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts|DCPA]], [[University of Iowa]], [[University of Utah]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) would be better able to conduct and disseminate research than a single organization. NCVS members, although geographically separate, were linked by a common desire to fully understand the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech.

In 1999, NIDCD discontinued the Multi-Purpose Research and Training Center funding mechanism for the entire institute focusing instead on single-project research awards (R01s). In a July 2000 meeting, however, NCVS investigators voted unanimously to continue the concept of a national resource center for voice and speech, to be driven by a variety of single-project research awards (R01s), as well as health communication, core, and training grants. In 2001, the NCVS moved its central location to Denver, where the otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould had founded a center to study the voice and speech patterns of stage performers.

The NCVS team of investigators, led by [[Ingo Titze]], studies the powers, limitations and enhancement of [[human voice]] and [[Speech communication|speech]].  The investigators are scientists, clinicians, educators, engineers and musicians who use diverse backgrounds (i.e., speech-language pathology, [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[acoustics]], [[human voice|vocal performance]], [[biology]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]]) to work together on voice and speech investigations.  As a direct outgrowth of their work, NCVS members also teach other investigators and practitioners who work with voice, as well as speech clients and the general public.  One example is the Summer Vocology Institute, which trains voice coaches and vocal health professionals in the study of [[Vocology]].

'''Note-taking''' (sometimes written as '''notetaking''' or '''note taking''') is the practice of recording [[information]] captured from another source. By taking notes, the writer records the essence of the information, freeing their mind from having to [[Information retrieval|recall]] everything.&lt;ref name="Dror"&gt;British Journal of Educational Technology (2008)

&lt;/ref&gt; Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source, such as an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are usually called [[minutes]]), in which case the notes may be the only record of the event.
Note taking is a form of [[Discipline#Self Discipline|self discipline]].

== History ==

Note-taking has been an important part of human history and scientific development. The Ancient Greeks developed [[hypomnema]], personal records on important subjects. In the Renaissance and early modern period, students learned to take notes in schools, academies and universities, oftentimes producing beautiful volumes that served as reference works after they finished their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Nature of Notebooks: How Enlightenment Schoolchildren Transformed the Tabula Rasa|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=2018|volume=57|pages=275–307|url=https://www.academia.edu/34448924/The_Nature_of_Notebooks_How_Enlightenment_Schoolchildren_Transformed_the_Tabula_Rasa_Journal_of_British_Studies_57_2018_275-307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Interactive Notebook: How Students Learned to Keep Notes during the Scottish Enlightenment|journal=Book History|date=2016|volume=19|pages=87–131|url=https://www.academia.edu/11429336/The_Interactive_Notebook_How_Students_Learned_to_Keep_Notes_during_the_Scottish_Enlightenment_Book_History_19_2016_87-131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In predigital times there were many kinds of notebooks used by adults, some of which included accounting waste books, marginalia, and [[commonplace books]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html Commonplace Books]. Harvard University Library Open Collections Program.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[John Locke]] developed an indexing system&lt;ref&gt;Locke J. (1706). [http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/13925922 A new method of making common-place-books]. Google Books: [A new method of making common-place-books https://books.google.com/books?id=sF0HMAEACAAJ]. Also included in Locke's&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a model for commonplace books; for example, it inspired another book, ''Bell’s Common-Place Book, Formed generally upon the Principles Recommended and Practised by Mr Locke'' nearly a century later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/04/the-glass-box-and-the-commonplace-book.html The Glass Box And The Commonplace Book].&lt;/ref&gt; Note-taking is something that many people haven't yet noticed how much it's changed over the course of history.

== Cognitive psychology ==

Note-taking is a central aspect of a complex human behavior related to information management involving a range of underlying mental processes and their interactions with other cognitive functions.&lt;ref name="piolat"&gt;Piolat, A., Olive, T. &amp; Kellogg, R. T. (2005). Cognitive effort during note-taking. Applied Cognitive
Psychology, 19, 291–312.&lt;/ref&gt; The person taking notes must acquire and filter the incoming sources, organize and restructure existing knowledge structures,  comprehend and write down their explanation of the information, and ultimately store and integrate the freshly processed material. The result is a knowledge representation, and a [[Storage (memory)|memory storage]].&lt;ref name="Dror"/&gt; Studies comparing the performance of students who took handwritten notes to students who typed their notes found that students who took handwritten notes performed better on examinations, hypothetically due to the deeper processing of learned material through selective rephrasing instead of word-for-word transcription which is common when typing notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Notes on Note-Taking: Review of Research and Insights for Students and Instructors|author=Michael C. Friedman|publisher=Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, Harvard University|url=https://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/notetaking_0.pdf|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems ==

Many different formats are used to structure information and make it easier to find and to understand, later. The format of the initial record may often be informal and/or unstructured. One common format for such notes is [[shorthand]], which can allow large amounts of information to be put on [[paper]] very quickly.  Note-taking is an important [[skill]] for [[student]]s, especially at the [[college]] level. Many students gain skills as they go through High School and most grasp onto the best and easiest note-taking techniques. Practice in note-taking may lead to great skills in it that may also lead to success in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tru.ca/arts/php/history/A_Handbook_for_TRU_History_Students/Note-taking.html|title=Note-taking: History: Thompson Rivers University|last=www.tru.ca|first=Thompson Rivers University,|website=www.tru.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, such as college lectures, the main purpose of taking notes may be to implant the material in the mind; the written notes themselves being of secondary importance. Historically, note-taking was an analog process, written in [[notebook]]s, or other  paper methods like [[Post-It]] notes. In the digital age, [[computer]]s,  [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s and [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) are common.

Note-taking is a race against time. The note taker typically is under severe time pressure, and different note-taking styles and techniques try to make the best use of time. The average rate of speech is 2–3 words per second, but the average handwriting speed as only 0.2–0.3 words per second.&lt;ref name="piolat"/&gt;

Regardless of the medium (paper, computer), note-taking can be broadly divided into linear and nonlinear methods, which can be combined.

People tend to write down the most important information to prevent losing time and be ready to note subsequent information provided.

It's also always important to go over the notes you write down on a loop to easily remember any of the information you went over.

== Linear note-taking ==
Linear note-taking is the process of writing down [[Information and communication technologies for development|information]] in the order in which you receive it. Paper is itself [[Two-dimensional materials|two-dimensional]] so linear notes follow the natural succession of time 1,2, and so on, beginning, middle and end. However, the human brain is thought to be multi-dimensional: the more connections one makes to current knowledge, the greater the likelihood of understanding, remembering and applying the information.

===Outlining===
Outlining &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citruscollege.edu/lc/studyskills/Pages/NoteTakingOutlineMethod.aspx|title=Note Taking: Outline Method|website=www.citruscollege.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most common but still one of the best note-taking systems. Notes and thoughts are organised in a structured, logical manner, reducing the time needed to edit and review, allowing a lot of information to be digested in a short period of time. Outlining is less effective for classes that involve many formulas and graphs, like mathematics or chemistry. In these situations, a system such as [[Cornell Notes|Cornell notes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-support-and-advising/study-tips/reading-textbooks.shtml|title=Reading a Textbook for True Understanding - Cornell College|website=www.cornellcollege.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be superior.

[[Outline (list)|Outlines]] tend to proceed down a page, using headings and [[Bullet (typography)|bullets]] to structure information. A common system consists of [[Subject heading|heading]]s that use [[Roman numerals]], letters of the [[alphabet]], and [[Arabic numerals]] at different levels.  A typical structure would be:

:I. First main topic
::A. Subtopic
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail
::B. Subtopic 
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail
:II. Second main topic
::A. Subtopic
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail    
::B. Subtopic
::# Detail
::# Detail
::# Detail

However, this sort of structure has limitations in written form since it is difficult to go back and insert more information. Adaptive systems are used for paper-and-pen insertions, such as using the reverse side of the preceding page in a spiral notebook to make insertions. Or one can simply leave large spaces in between items, to enable more material to be inserted. The above method is effective for most people, but you can be creative in making your own method. (See [[:Category: Outliners]] for more about application software that supports outlining).

However, computerized note-taking, whether with a [[word processor]], an outliner like [[Workflowy]], or a digital notebook program such as [[OneNote]], [[Evernote]] or [[TiddlyWiki]], provides the opportunity to revise easily and add more entries or rows to the outline.

== Non-linear note-taking ==

[[Non-linear editing system|Non-linear]] note-taking involves using mind maps and [[Mind map|spidergrams]] that start with notes in the middle of a page, commonly in an oval representing the topic. Non-linear note taking  may require additional sheets of paper extending the notes at the top, bottom or sides, giving an [[Holistic health|holistic]] overview of the information. The many types of non-linear note-taking include clustering,&lt;ref&gt;Rico, G. L. (1983). Writing the natural way: using right-brain techniques to release your expressive powers.

===[[Charting]]===
This method of note taking is useful for subject matter that can be broken into categories, such as similarities, differences, date, event, impact, etc. Charting works best if students are able to identify categories and draw a table prior to the lecture. This method is also useful as an editing tool. Students may review and rewrite notes using the charting method. The method may work well  for students who like to organize information neatly and who learn by recognizing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://msliewsclass.weebly.com/charting-method.html|title=Charting Method|website=Ms. Liew's Class|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Mindmap.gif|thumb|right|A mind map connects ideas together visually]]

===Mapping===
Mapping is one of the many forms of note-taking that employs geographic organizers and diagrams to assemble information. This specific method encourages students to continually practice and also to create flash cards because mapping method doesn't come naturally to everyone in the beginning, so practice is essential. Here, ideas are written in a [[tree (graph theory)|tree structure]], with lines connecting them together. [[Mind map]]s, also referred to as [[Brainstorming|brain-storming]] are commonly drawn from a central point, purpose or goal in the center of the page and then branching outward to identify all the ideas connected to that goal. Colors, small graphics and symbols are often used to help to visualize the information more easily. This note-taking method is most common among visual learners and is a core practice of many accelerated learning techniques. It is also used for planning and writing essays.

This method are also for people that have a visual mindset when they take notes better on drawing pictures with different shapes and diagrams. Those who feel comfortable using this method tend to use a lot of colors in their diagrams to make them focused and concentrated in what they  are writing.  For instance, many who use this method might feel more focused when their teacher or professor who use a lot of colors in their power point slides since, the person themselves might like to use colors and use different colors to categorize different kinds of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cristine|first=Goldberg,|date=November 2004|title=Brain Friendly Techniques: Mind Mapping.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ720682|journal=School Library Media Activities Monthly|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|issn=0889-9371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence method===
Sentence note taking is simply writing down each topic as a short, simple sentence. This method works well for fast paced lesson where a lot of information is being covered. Everyone should record every new thought, fact or topic on a separate line. All information is recorded but is not organized into major and minor topics. Every new thought is written as a new line. Speed is essential, because not much thought about [[Page layout|formatting]] is needed to  create space for more notes. Notes can be numbered or set off with bullets showing where a new thought begins. This strategy is especially helpful when a professor or teacher asks to read the notes. It also saves the time required to formulate and write long, complex sentences.

===SQ3R===
[[SQ3R]] is a method of taking notes from written material, though it might be better classed as a method of reading and gaining understanding. Material is skimmed to produce a list of headings, that are then converted into questions. These questions are then considered whilst the text is read to provide motivation for what is being covered. Notes are written under sections headed by the questions as each of the material's sections is read. One then makes a summary from memory, and reviews the notes.  (SQ3R—Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review.). However, there is another updated version called '''''[[SQ3R|SQ4R,]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brazosport.edu/programs/academics/Learning-Frameworks/SQ4R/index|title=SQ4R Reading Method|website=brazosport.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been used by students since the early 60's. It's probably worth your time to try the steps first, then choose and apply only those that really work effectively. It provides a systematic way of comprehending and studying the content that is being spoken. Now students are able to monitor their own [[Understanding|comprehension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.readnaturally.com/research/5-components-of-reading/comprehension|title=Strategies for Reading Comprehension :: Read Naturally, Inc.|website=www.readnaturally.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; through review. Current research shows that students who use the SQ3R strategy retain more information and achieve higher test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlston|first=David L.|date=2011-06-14|title=Benefits of Student-Generated Note Packets|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0098628311411786|journal=Teaching of Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=142–146|doi=10.1177/0098628311411786|issn=0098-6283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guided notes ===
Sometimes lecturers may provide handouts of guided notes, which provide a "map" of the lecture content with key points or ideas missing. Students then fill in missing items as the lecture progresses. Guided notes may assist students in following lectures and identifying the most important ideas from a lecture. This format provides students with a framework, yet requires active listening (as opposed to providing copies of power point slides in their entirety), and promotes active engagement during lecture or [[independent reading]], provide full and accurate notes for use as a study guide, helping the student to identify the most important information covered. Research suggests that guided notes improve student recording of critical points in lecture, as well as quiz scores on related content. In addition, an investigation carried out on students with learning problems showed that the use of the guided notes is an effective strategy to improve the performance of these students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=Sheri L.|last2=Seibert|first2=Marilyn A.|last3=Gardner|first3=Ralph|last4=Talbert-Johnson|first4=Carolyn|date=May 2000|title=Using Guided Notes to Improve the Academic Achievement of Incarcerated Adolescents with Learning and Behavior Problems|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/074193250002100302|journal=Remedial and Special Education|volume=21|issue=3|pages=133–170|doi=10.1177/074193250002100302|issn=0741-9325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic note-taking methods==
{{see also|Electronic notetaking}}
The growing ubiquity of laptops in universities and colleges has led to a rise in electronic note-taking. Many students write their notes in [[word processor]]s or prepare digital hand-written notes using a [[graphics tablet]] or [[tablet computer]] and [[stylus|styli]] or [[digital pen]]s, with the aid of note-taking [[software]]. Online applications are receiving growing attention from students who can forward notes using email, or otherwise make use of collaborative features in these applications and can also download the texts as a file (txt, rtf...) in a local computer. It has also become common for [[lecturer]]s to deliver [[lecture]]s using these and similar technologies, including [[electronic whiteboard]]s, especially at [[Institute of technology|institutes of technology]].

Online note-taking has created problems for teachers who must balance educational [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom]] with copyright and intellectual property concerns regarding course content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.becoming-a-lawyer.com/law-students/how-to/take-notes-law-student/|title=How to take notes as a law student - Becoming A Lawyer|date=2017-01-06|work=Becoming A Lawyer|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic note-taking has shown ineffectiveness when compared to traditional methods of note-taking. A study done by Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California have shown that students who take notes digitally against students who take notes on paper retain less information and have difficulties remembering what they've typed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away|title=Attention, Students: Put Your Laptops Away|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic note-taking has created computer-aided distractions in class as multitasking on laptops is very easy to accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cain|first=J|last2=Bird|first2=ER|last3=Jones|first3=MK|date=2008|title=Mobile computing initiatives within pharmacy education.|pmc=4812780|journal=Am J Pharm Educ.|volume=4|pages=72|via=US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. American Journal Of Pharmaceutical Education.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these researches are only about typing notes on laptops, not writing on tablets.

Laptops are usually a controlled device in classrooms and students may or not be able to take notes on their digital devices when required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noteshel.com/blog/22-the-advantages-of-handwritten-notes-vs-digital|title=The Advantages of handwritten notes vs. digital|last=|first=|date=April 25, 2018|website=NoteShel|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Cornell Notes|Cornell Method]] ==
[[File:NotesCornell.png|thumb|Cornell Method "One of the most influential method of developmental education and study skills"]]
The [[Cornell method|Cornell Method]] is a systematical structure that help organize your notes, actively involve you in the creation of knowledge, improve your study expertness, and lead to academic success. The Cornell method of taking notes was developed by Dr. [[Walter Pauk]] of [[Cornell University]] in 1940's. This effective system for taking notes was made prestigious by Pauk's best selling book ''How To Study In College'' and is commonly used at many universities today. The Cornell method consists of dividing a single page into three sections: Notes, Cues and a Summary, its own system is characterized by a right hand column for notes, a left hand column for provoking key words or some type of questions that might help remember key aspects of the topic. Cornell Method also help students worldwide combat the effects of forgetting, which can be instantaneous and complete. It is recommended to read the notes at least 3 times in order for the content to sink in. Otherwise, with time it will be forgotten. For more information please refer to the article  [[Forgetting curve|Forgetting Curve]].

== Professional Notetaking Services ==

Professional notetakers provide access to information for people who cannot take their own notes, in particular the [[deaf]] and [[hearing impaired]].  Professional Notetakers most frequently work in [[colleges]] and [[universities]], but are also used in workplace meetings, appointments, conferences, and training sessions. They are usually educated to degree level. In the UK they are increasingly expected to have a professional note-taking qualification, such as that offered by the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-13|title=Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Council_for_the_Advancement_of_Communication_with_Deaf_People&amp;oldid=795341248|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CACDP). Professional freelance notetakers can also be supplied by transcription services companies, such as [https://takenotetyping.com/services/live-notetaking-minutes/ Take Note]

Telepractice is a method of reaching students and individuals in any distant location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=20010122&amp;id=tVFUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5013,4936776 | title=New Internet Program Enhances Speech Therapy | work=Boca Raton News | date=Jan 22, 2001 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telepractice is defined by the [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association]] (ASHA) as the use of technology to provide speech therapy services to remote regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/academic/questions/Telehealth-and-Telepractices/ | title=What should I know about telehealth and telepractice?

==Assessment==
Assessment for online speech therapy consists of an informal oral exam by a licensed trained professional through video conferencing or a web application. Patients are initially screened for communication disorders with diagnosis and consultation for provision counseling including cognitive aspects of communication, syntax, [[hypophonia]] and upper aerodigestive functions. The [[therapist]] and patient communicate via telecommunication technology where they can interact in real time. Therapy may cover speech sound production, fluency, language, cognition and written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Professional-Issues/Telepractice/ | title=Telepractice Overview | publisher=asha.org | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapists create an assessment document or report that is updated after every session. The document is reported to the parents or the referral source in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and [[FERPA]]. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also known as HIPAA is a federal law that protects patient medical records. HIPAA specifically protects “individually identifiable health information.” The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act known as FERPA is a federal law that protects student education records. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records until they turn 18 or transfer to a school higher than the high school level, thus making them “eligible students.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.asha.org/2014/04/15/beyond-skype-for-online-therapy-protecting-student-privacy/#_ga=1.131523532.2146824548.1428276224|title=Beyond Skype for Online Therapy: Protecting Student Privacy - Leader Live — Happening now in the speech-language-hearing world|date=15 April 2014|website=asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical departments in Universities also offer speech and language therapy services where they keep recorded video of sessions between clinicians and patients secured through password security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sphs.osu.edu/clinic/speech-language-services/telepractice | title=Telepractice, Department of Speech &amp; Hearing Science | publisher=The Ohio State University | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
Online speech therapy courses are offered by professional associations, Universities and cyber schools for treatment of communication disorders. The minimum eligibility for an online speech therapy course is a bachelor's degree for Master's entry-level field and master's degree for CScD offered by professional associations and Universities in the United States. The speech therapist course is not available for Bachelors or under graduate degree level in the United States. The pathologists are required to attain a minimum of 400 clinical hours to complete the course. In Asian countries, the course is open for Bachelors level degree program offered by Universities.

Speech Pathologist are also required to complete 400 hours clinical hours and pass the KASA exams in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23325">An '''ontological commitment''' refers to a relation between a language and certain objects postulated to be extant by that language. The 'existence' referred to need not be 'real', but exist only in a [[universe of discourse]].  As an example, legal systems use vocabulary referring to 'legal persons' that are collective entities that have rights. One says the legal doctrine has an ''ontological commitment'' to non-singular individuals.&lt;ref name=Schafer/&gt;   In [[information system]]s and [[artificial intelligence]], where an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] refers to a specific vocabulary and a set of explicit assumptions about the meaning and usage of these words, then an ontological commitment is an agreement to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner within a specific context.&lt;ref name=Guarino/&gt; In philosophy a "theory is '''ontologically committed''' to an object only if that object occurs in ''all'' the ontologies of that theory"&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;

== Background ==
The sentence “Napoleon is one of my ancestors” apparently commits us only to the existence of two individuals (i.e., [[Napoleon]] and the speaker) and a line of ancestry between them. The fact that no other people or objects are mentioned seems to limit the “commitment” of the sentence. However, it is well known that sentences of this kind cannot be interpreted in [[first-order logic]], where individual variables stand for individual things. Instead, they must be represented in some [[second-order logic|second-order]] form. In ordinary language, such second-order forms use either grammatical plurals or terms such as “set of” or “group of”.

For example, the sentence involving Napoleon can be rewritten as “any group of people that includes me and the parents of each person in the group must also include Napoleon,” which is easily interpreted as a statement in second-order logic (one would naturally start by assigning a name, such as ''G'', to the group of people under consideration). Formally, collective noun forms such as “a group of people” are represented by [[second-order variable]]s, or by [[first-order variable]]s standing for [[set (mathematics)|sets]] (which are [[well-defined]] objects in [[mathematics]] and logic). Since these variables do not stand for individual objects, it seems we are “ontologically committed” to entities other than individuals — sets, classes, and so on. As [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] puts it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the general adoption of class variables of quantification ushers in a theory whose laws were not in general expressible in the antecedent levels of logic. The price paid for this increased power is [[ontological]]: objects of a special and abstract kind, [[viz.]] classes, are now presupposed. Formally it is precisely in allowing [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] over class variables α, β, etc., that we assume a range of values for these variables to refer to. To be assumed as an entity is to be assumed as a value of a variable. (''[[Methods of Logic]]'' p. 228)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another statement about individuals that appears “ontologically innocent” is the well-known [[Geach–Kaplan sentence]]: ''Some critics admire only one another.''

==Quine's analysis==

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] provided an early and influential formulation of ontological commitment:&lt;ref name=Quine1/&gt;
{{quote|If one affirms a statement using a name or other singular term, or an initial phrase of 'existential quantification', like 'There are some so-and-sos', then one must either (1) admit that one is committed to the existence of things answering to the singular term or satisfying the descriptions, or (2) provide a 'paraphrase' of the statement that eschews singular terms and quantification over so-and sos. Quine's criterion can be seen as a logical development of the methods of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G.E. Moore]], who assumed that one must accept the existence of entities corresponding to the singular terms used in statements one accepts, unless and until one finds systematic methods of paraphrase that eliminate these terms.&lt;ref name=Loux/&gt;|Michael J. Loux &amp; Dean W. Zimmerman|The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics, p. 4}}

The purpose of Quine's strategy is to determine just how the ''ontological commitment'' of a theory is to be found. Quine argued that the only ontologically committing expressions are variables bound by a first-order existential quantifier, and natural language expressions which were formalized using variables bound by first-order existential quantifiers.&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dejnozka/&gt;

Attempts have been made to argue that [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s are also ontologically committing, and thus that subject-predicate sentences bear additional ontological commitment to [[abstract object]]s such as [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]s, [[set (mathematics)|sets]], or [[class (philosophy)|classes]]. It has been suggested that the use of meaningful names in nonexistence statements such as “Pegasus does not exist” brings with it an ontological commitment to [[fictional object]]s like Pegasus, a quandary referred to as [[Plato's beard]] and escaped by using quantifiers.&lt;ref name=Fogelin/&gt;

This discussion has a connection to the Carnap-Quine argument over analytic and synthetic objects.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; Although Quine refers to 'ontological commitment' in this connection,&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt; in his rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction he does not rely upon the formal translation of any particular theory along the lines he has suggested.&lt;ref name=Quine0/&gt;  Instead, Quine argues by using examples that although there are tautological statements in a formal theory, like "all squares are rectangles", a formal theory necessarily contains references to objects that are not tautological, but have external connections. That is, there is an ''ontological commitment'' to such external objects. In addition, the terms used to interpret the application of the theory are not simply descriptions of sensory input, but are statements in a context. That is, inversely, there is an ''ontological commitment'' of these observational objects to the formal theory. As Ryan puts it: "Rather than being divided between contingent synthetic claims and indubitable analytic propositions, our beliefs constitute a continuous range from a periphery of sense-reports to interior concepts that are comparatively theory-laden and general."&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt;  Thus we end up with Quine's 'flat' ontology that does not see a distinction between analytic and synthetic objects.&lt;ref name=Schaffer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt;

Whatever process one uses to determine the ontological commitments of a theory, that does not prescribe what ontological commitments one should have. Quine regarded this as a matter of [[epistemology]], which theory one should accept. "Appeal is made to [concerns of] explanatory power, parsimony, conservatism, precision, and so on".&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

===Ontological parsimony===
Ontological parsimony can be defined in various ways, and often is equated to versions of [[Occam's razor]], a "rule of thumb, which obliges us to favor theories or hypotheses that make the fewest unwarranted, or ''ad hoc'', assumptions about the data from which they are derived."&lt;ref name=Henke/&gt; Glock regards 'ontological parsimony' as one of the 'five main points' of Quine's conception of ontology.&lt;ref name=Glock/&gt;

Following Quine,&lt;ref name=QuineW/&gt; Baker states that a theory, ''T'', is ''ontologically committed'' to items ''F'' if and only if ''T'' entails that ''F′''s exist.  If two theories, ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', have the same ontological commitments except that ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ontologically committed to ''F′''s while ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not, then ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is more parsimonious than ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. More generally, a sufficient condition for ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' being more parsimonious than ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is for the ontological commitments of ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to be a proper subset of those of ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

These ideas lead to the following particular formulation of Occam's razor: 'Other things being equal, if ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is more ontologically parsimonious than ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' then it is rational to prefer ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.'  While a common formulation stipulates only that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity, this version by contrast, states that entities should not be multiplied ''other things being equal'', and this is compatible with parsimony being a comparatively weak theoretical virtue.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

== Recent controversies ==
The standard approach to ontological commitment has been that, once a theory has been regimented and/or "paraphrased" into an agreed "canonical" version,&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; which may indeed be in formal logical notation rather than the original language of the theory, ontological commitments can be read off straightforwardly from the presence of certain ontologically committing expressions (e.g. bound variables of existential quantification). Although there is substantial debate about which expressions are ontologically committing,&lt;ref name=French/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colyvan/&gt; parties to that debate generally agree that the expressions they prefer are reliable bearers of ontological commitment, imparting ontological commitment to all regimented sentences in which they occur. This assumption has been challenged.

Inwagen has taken issue with Quine's methodology,&lt;ref name=Inwagen/&gt; claiming that this process did not lead to a unique set of fundamental objects, but to several possible sets, and one never could be certain that all the possible sets had been found. He also took issue with Quine's notion of a theory, which he felt was tantamount to suggesting a 'theory' was just a collection of sentences. Inwagen suggested that Quine's approach provided useful tools for discovering what entities were ontological commitments, but that he had not been successful. His attempts are comparable to an "attempt to reach the moon by climbing ever higher trees..."&lt;ref name=Inwagen2/&gt;

It has been suggested that the ontological commitments of a theory cannot be discerned by analysis of the syntax of sentences, looking for ontologically committing expressions, because the true ontological commitments of a sentence (or theory) are restricted to the entities needed to serve as [[truthmaker]]s for that sentence, and the syntax of even a regimented or formalized sentence is not a reliable guide to what entities are needed to make it true.&lt;ref name=Heil/&gt; However, this view has been attacked by Jonathan Shaffer, who has argued that truthmaking is not an adequate test for ontological commitment: at best, the search for the truthmakers of our theory will tell us what is "fundamental", but not what our theory is ontologically committed to, and hence will not serve as a good way of deciding what exists.&lt;ref name=Schaffer1/&gt;

It also has been argued that the syntax of sentences is not a reliable guide to their ontological commitments because English has no form of words which reliably functions to make an existence-claim in every context in which it is used. For example, Jody Azzouni suggests that "There is" does not make any kind of genuine existence-claim when it is used in a sentence such as "There are mice that talk". Since the meaning of the existential quantifier in formal notation is usually explained in terms of its equivalence to English expressions such as "there is" and "there exist", and since these English expressions are not reliably ontologically committing, it comes to seem that we cannot be sure of our theory's ontological commitments even after it has been regimented into a canonical formulation.&lt;ref name=Azzouni/&gt; This argument has been attacked by Howard Peacock,&lt;ref name=Peacock/&gt; who suggests that Azzouni's strategy conflates two different kinds of ontological commitment – one which is intended as a measure of what a theory explicitly claims to exist, and one which is intended as a measure of what is required for the theory to be true; what the ontological costs of the theory are. If ontological commitment is thought of as a matter of the ontological costs of a theory, then it is possible that a sentence may be ontologically committed to an entity even though competent speakers of the language do not recognize the sentence as asserting the existence of that entity. Ontological commitment is not a matter of what commitments one explicitly recognizes, but rather a matter of what commitments are actually incurred.

:The '''ontological commitments''' of a theory are those things which occur in all the ''ontologies'' of that theory. To explain further, the [[ontology]] of a theory consists of the objects the theory makes use of. A dependence of a theory upon an object is indicated if the theory fails when the object is omitted. However, the ontology of a theory is not necessarily unique. A theory is '''ontologically committed''' to an object only if that object occurs in ''all'' the ontologies of that theory. A theory also can be ''ontologically committed'' to a class of objects if that class is populated (not necessarily by the same objects) in all its ontologies.

'''Palaeography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|UK]]) or '''paleography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|US]]; ultimately from {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|παλαιός}}}}, ''palaiós'', "old", and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|γράφειν}}}}, ''graphein'', "to write") is the study of ancient and historical [[handwriting]] (that is to say, of the forms and processes of writing; not the textual content of documents). Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;'Palaeography', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiceducationproject.org/legacy/projects/paleography/index.html |title=Latin Palaeography Network |publisher=Civiceducationproject.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating ancient texts. However, it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision.

== Application ==
Palaeography can be an essential skill for [[historian]]s and [[philology|philologists]], as it tackles two main difficulties. First, since the style of a single [[alphabet]] in each given language has evolved constantly, it is necessary to know how to decipher its individual characters as they existed in various eras. Second, [[scribe]]s often used many [[abbreviation]]s, usually so as to write more quickly and sometimes to save space, so the specialist-palaeographer must know how to interpret them. Knowledge of individual [[Letterform|letter-forms]], [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], [[punctuation]], and [[abbreviation]]s enables the palaeographer to read and understand the text. The palaeographer must know, first, the language of the text (that is, one must become expert in the relevant earlier forms of these languages); and second, the historical usages of various styles of handwriting, common writing customs, and scribal or [[notary|notarial]] abbreviations. [[Philology|Philological knowledge]] of the language, vocabulary, and grammar generally used at a given time or place can help palaeographers identify ancient or more recent [[forgeries]] versus authentic documents.

Knowledge of [[writing material]]s is also essential to the study of handwriting and to the identification of the periods in which a document or manuscript may have been produced.&lt;ref name=fn_3&gt;Robert P. Gwinn, "Paleography" in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], [[Micropædia]], Vol. IX, 1986, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An important goal may be to assign the text a date and a place of origin: this is why the palaeographer must take into account the style and formation of the manuscript and the handwriting used in it.&lt;ref name=fn_4&gt;Fernando De Lasala, ''Exercise of Latin Paleography'' ([[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University of Rome]], 2006) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Document dating ===
Palaeography can be used to provide information about the date at which a document was written. However, "paleography is a last resort for dating" and, "for book hands, a period of 50 years is the least acceptable spread of time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Eric G. |year=1987 |title=Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Institute of Classical Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nongbri24"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |last=Nongbri |first=Brent |year=2005 |title=The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel |journal=Harvard Theological Review |volume=98 |pages=23–48 (24) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216200012/http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being suggested that "the 'rule of thumb' should probably be to avoid dating a hand more precisely than a range of at least seventy or eighty years".&lt;ref name="nongbri24" /&gt; In a 2005 e-mail addendum to his 1996 "The Paleographical Dating of P-46" paper Bruce W.

== Aramaic palaeography ==
[[File:Mandaic Alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Table showing the [[Mandaic alphabet]] (Abagada) with some of the mysteries represented by the letters]]

The [[Aramaic language]] was the international trade language of the [[Ancient Middle East]], originating in what is modern-day [[Syria]], between 1000 and 600&amp;nbsp;BC. It spread from the [[Mediterranean coast]] to the borders of [[India]], becoming extremely popular and being adopted by many people, both with or without any previous writing system. The [[Aramaic script]] was written in a [[Abjad|consonantal form]] with a direction from right to left. The [[Aramaic alphabet]], a modified form of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], was the ancestor of the [[Arabic alphabet|modern Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s, as well as the [[Brāhmī script]], the parent writing system of most modern [[abugida]]s in [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Tibet]], and [[Mongolia]]. Initially, the Aramaic script did not differ from the Phoenician, but then the [[Aramaeans]] simplified some of the letters, thickened and rounded their lines: a specific feature of its letters is the distinction between '''d''' and '''r'''. One innovation in Aramaic is the ''[[matres lectionis]]'' system to indicate certain vowels. Early Phoenician-derived scripts did not have letters for vowels, and so most texts recorded just consonants. Most likely as a consequence of phonetic changes in North Semitic languages, the Aramaeans reused certain letters in the alphabet to represent long vowels. The letter ''[[aleph]]'' was employed to write /'''ā'''/, ''he'' for /'''ō'''/, ''yod'' for /'''ī'''/, and ''vav'' for /'''ū'''/.

Aramaic writing and language supplanted [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] [[cuneiform]] and [[Akkadian language]], even in their homeland in [[Mesopotamia]]. The wide diffusion of Aramaic letters led to its writing being used not only in monumental inscriptions, but also on [[papyrus]] and [[potsherds]]. Aramaic papyri have been found in large numbers in Egypt, especially at [[Elephantine papyri|Elephantine]]—among them are official and private documents of the [[Jewish military history|Jewish military settlement]] in 5&amp;nbsp;BC. In the Aramaic papyri and potsherds, words are separated usually by a small gap, as in modern writing. At the turn of the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC, the heretofore uniform Aramaic letters developed new forms, as a result of dialectal and political fragmentation in several subgroups. The most important of these is the so-called [[Hebrew square script|square Hebrew block script]], followed by [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]], [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]], and the much later [[Syriac script]].

Aramaic is usually divided into three main parts:&lt;ref name="Bey" /&gt;
# Old Aramaic (in turn subdivided into Ancient, Imperial, Old Eastern and Old Western Aramaic)
# Middle Aramaic, and
# Modern Aramaic of the present day.

The term Middle Aramaic refers to the form of Aramaic which appears in pointed texts and is reached in the 3rd century AD with the loss of short unstressed vowels in open syllables, and continues until the triumph of [[Arabic]].

Old Aramaic appeared in the 11th century BC as the official language of the first [[Syro-Hittite states|Aramaean states]]. The oldest witnesses to it are inscriptions from northern [[Syria]] of the 10th to 8th centuries BC, especially extensive state treaties (c. 750 BC) and royal inscriptions. The early Old Ancient should be classified as "Ancient Aramaic" and consists of two clearly distinguished and standardised written languages, the Early Ancient Aramaic and the Late Ancient Aramaic. Aramaic was influenced at first principally by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], then from the 5th century BC by [[Persian language|Persian]] and from the 3rd century BC onwards by [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as by [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], especially in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Bey"&gt;Cf. Klaus Beyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZ53zpMQNLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Aramaic Language''], Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1986, pp. 9- 15; Rainer Degen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nrRcQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Altaramäische Grammatik der Inschriften des 10-8 Jh.v.Chr.''], [[Wiesbaden]], repr. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; As Aramaic evolved into the imperial language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], the script used to write it underwent a change into something more cursive. The best examples of this script come from documents written on papyrus from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;This script was also used during the reign of King [[Ashoka]] in his edicts to spread early [[Buddhism]]. Cf. [http://www.ancientscripts.com/aramaic.html "Ancient Scripts: Aramaic"]. Accessed 05/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 BC, [[Darius I]] (522–486) made the Aramaic used by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid imperial administration]] into the official language of the western half of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This so-called "Imperial Aramaic" (the oldest dated example, from Egypt, belonging to 495 BC) is based on an otherwise unknown written form of Ancient Aramaic from [[Babylonia]]. In orthography, Imperial Aramaic preserves historical forms—[[alphabet]], [[orthography]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]] and [[Style (sociolinguistics)|style]] are highly standardised. Only the formularies of the private documents and the [[Ahiqar|Proverbs of Ahiqar]] have maintained an older tradition of sentence structure and style. Imperial Aramaic immediately replaced Ancient Aramaic as a written language and, with slight modifications, it remained the official, commercial and literary language of the [[Near East]] until gradually, beginning with the fall of the Persian Empire (331 BC) and ending in the 4th century AD, it was replaced by Greek, Persian, the eastern and western dialects of Aramaic and Arabic, though not without leaving its traces in the written form of most of these. In its original Achaemenid form, Imperial Aramaic is found in texts of the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. These come mostly from Egypt and especially from the [[Jewish temple at Elephantine#Jewish temple at Elephantine|Jewish military colony]] of [[Elephantine]], which existed at least from 530 to 399 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

A history of Greek handwriting must be incomplete owing to the fragmentary nature of evidence. If one rules out the inscriptions on stone or metal, which belong to the science of {{small caps|[[epigraphy]]}}, we are practically dependent for the period preceding the 4th or 5th century AD on the [[papyri]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (cf. {{small caps|[[papyrology]]}}), the earliest of which take back our knowledge only to the end of the 4th century BC. This limitation is less serious than might appear, since the few [[manuscript]]s not of Egyptian origin which have survived from this period, like the parchments from [[Avroman]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. E. H. Minns, ''Journ. of Hell. Stud.'', xxxv, pp.22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''New Pal. Soc.'', ii, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Herculaneum papyri]], and a few documents found in Egypt but written elsewhere, reveal a uniformity of style in the various portions of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]]; but some differences can be discerned, and it is probable that, were there more material, distinct local styles could be traced.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;In creating and expanding the following sections on {{small caps|Greek palaeography}}—inclusive of the "Vellum and Paper Manuscripts" subsection—specialist sources have been consulted and thoroughly perused for the relevant text and citations, as follows: primarily the article on ''general palaeography'' by renowned [[United Kingdom|British]] [[papyrology|papyrologist]] and scholar Sir [[Harold Idris Bell]], present in  {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Palaeography#Greek Writing I|display=Palaeography § Greek Writing}} |volume=20 |pages=557–567}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/557/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; [[Barry B.

These texts will be referred to throughout the present article with relevant inline citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, any given period several types of hand may exist together. There was a marked difference between the hand used for literary works (generally called "[[uncials]]" but, in the [[papyrus]] period, better styled "book-hand") and that of documents ("[[cursive]]") and within each of these classes several distinct styles were employed side by side; and the various types are not equally well represented in the surviving papyri.

The development of any hand is largely influenced by the materials used. To this general rule the Greek script is no exception. Whatever may have been the period at which the use of papyrus or leather as a writing material began in Greece (and papyrus was employed in the 5th century BC), it is highly probable that for some time after the introduction of the [[alphabet]] the characters were incised with a sharp tool on stones or metal far oftener than they were written with a pen. In cutting a hard surface, it is easier to form angles than curves; in writing the reverse is the case; hence the development of writing was from angular letters ("capitals") inherited from [[epigraphy|epigraphic style]] to rounded ones ("uncials"). But only certain letters were affected by this development, in particular '''E''' (uncial '''ε'''), '''Σ''' ('''c'''), '''Ω''' ('''ω'''), and to a lesser extent '''A''' ('''α''').

=== Ptolemaic period ===
[[File:P.Berol. inv. 9875 col. v coronis.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Berlin]] papyrus 9875 showing the 5th column of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus']] ''Persae'', with a [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]] symbol to mark the end.]]

The earliest Greek papyrus yet discovered is probably that containing the ''Persae'' of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus]], which dates from the second half of the 4th century BC and its script has a curiously archaic appearance. '''E''', '''Σ''', and '''Ω''' have the capital form, and apart from these test letters the general effect is one of stiffness and angularity.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Timotheus' poetry survive, published in T. Bergk, ''Poetae lyrici graeci''. The cit. papyrus-fragment of his ''Persae (Persians)'' was discovered at [[Abusir]] and has been edited by [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], ''Der Timotheos-Papyrus gefunden bei Abusir am 1. Februar 1902'', Leipzig: Hinrichs (1903), with content discussion. Cf. V. Strazzulla, ''Persiani di Eschilo ed il nomo di Timoteo'' (1904); S. Sudhaus in ''Rhein. Mus.'', iviii. (1903), p. 481; and T. Reinach and M. Croiset in ''Revue des etudes grecques'', xvi. (1903), pp. 62, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; More striking is the hand of the earliest dated papyrus, a contract of 311 BC. Written with more ease and elegance, it shows little trace of any development towards a truly [[cursive]] style; the letters are not linked, and though the uncial '''c''' is used throughout, '''E''' and '''Ω''' have the capital forms. A similar impression is made by the few other papyri, chiefly literary, dating from about 300 BC; '''E''' may be slightly rounded, '''Ω''' approach the uncial form, and the angular '''Σ''' occurs as a letter only in the Timotheus papyrus, though it survived longer as a numeral (= 200), but the hands hardly suggest that for at least a century and a half the art of writing on papyrus had been well established. Yet before the middle of the 3rd century BC, one finds both a practised book-hand and a developed and often remarkably handsome cursive.

These facts may be due to accident, the few early papyri happening to represent an archaic style which had survived along with a more advanced one; but it is likely that there was a rapid development at this period, due partly to the opening of Egypt, with its supplies of papyri, and still more to the establishment of the great [[Alexandrian Library]], which systematically copied literary and scientific works, and to the multifarious activities of [[Hellenistic]] bureaucracy. From here onward, the two types of script were sufficiently distinct (though each influenced the other) to require separate treatment. Some literary papyri, like the roll containing [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'', were written in cursive hands, and, conversely, the book-hand was occasionally used for documents. Since the scribe did not date literary rolls, such papyri are useful in tracing the development of the book-hand.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The documents of the mid-3rd century BC show a great variety of [[cursive]] hands. There are none from chancelleries of the Hellenistic monarchs, but some letters, notably those of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]], the finance minister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]], to this agent, Zeno, and those of the Palestianian sheikh, Toubias, are in a type of script which cannot be very unlike the [[Chancery hand]] of the time, and show the Ptolemaic cursive at its best. These hands have a noble spaciousness and strength, and though the individual letters are by no means uniform in size there is a real unity of style, the general impression being one of breadth and uprightness. '''H''', with the cross-stroke high, '''Π''', '''Μ''', with the middle stroke reduced to a very shallow curve, sometimes approaching a horizontal line, '''Υ''', and '''Τ''', with its cross-bar extending much further to the left than to the right of the up-stroke, '''Γ''' and '''Ν''', whose last stroke is prolonged upwards above the line, often curving backwards, are all broad; '''ε''', '''c''', '''θ''' and '''β''', which sometimes takes the form of two almost perpendicular strokes joined only at the top, are usually small; '''ω''' is rather flat, its second loop reduced to a practically straight line. Partly by the broad flat tops of the larger letters, partly by the insertion of a stroke connecting those (like H, Υ) which are not naturally adapted to linking, the scribes produced the effect of a horizontal line along the top of the writing, from which the letters seem to hang. This feature is indeed a general characteristic of the more formal Ptolemaic script, but it is specially marked in the 3rd century BC.

[[File:The Derveni Papyrus.jpg|thumb|The [[Derveni Papyrus]], a Greek Macedonian philosophical text dating around 340 BC, considered Europe's oldest manuscript]]

Besides these hand of Chancery type, there are numerous less elaborate examples of cursive, varying according to the writer's skill and degree of education, and many of them strikingly easy and handsome.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In some cursiveness is carried very far, the linking of letters reaching the point of illegibility, and the characters sloping to the right. '''A''' is reduced to a mere acute angle (&lt;big&gt;'''∠'''&lt;/big&gt;), '''T''' has the cross-stroke only on the left, '''ω''' becomes an almost straight line, '''H''' acquires a shape somewhat like &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt;, and the last stroke of '''N''' is extended far upwards and at times flattened out until it is little more than a diagonal stroke to the right. The attempt to secure a horizontal line along the top is here abandoned. This style was not due to inexpertness, but to the desire for speed, being used especially in accounts and drafts, and was generally the work of practised writers. How well established the cursive hand had now become is shown in some wax tablets of this period, the writing on which, despite the difference of material, closely resemble the hands of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Wax tablets of this period are preserved at the [[University College London]], cf. ''Speaking in the Wax Tablets of Memory'', Agocs, PA (2013). In: Castagnoli, L. and Ceccarelli, P, (eds.), Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents of the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BC show, perhaps partly by the accident of survival (there is nothing analogous to the Apollonius letters, a loss of breadth and spaciousness. In the more formal types the letters stand rather stiffly upright, often without the linking strokes, and are more uniform in size; in the more cursive they are apt to be packed closely together. These features are more marked in the hands of the 2nd century. The less cursive often show am approximation to the book-hand, the letters growing rounder and less angular than in the 3rd century; in the more cursive linking was carried further, both by the insertion of coupling strokes and by the writing of several letters continuously without raising the pen, so that before the end of the century an almost current hand was evolved. A characteristic letter, which survived into the early Roman period, is '''T''', with its cross-stroke made in two portions (variants:[[File:Greek cursive variants Tau.svg|70px]]). In the 1st century, the hand tended, so far as can be inferred from surviving examples, to disintegrate; one can recognise the signs which portend a change of style, irregularity, want of direction, and the loss of the feeling for style. A fortunate accident has preserved two Greek [[parchment]]s written in [[Parthia]], one dated 88 BC, in a practically unligatured hand, the other, 22/21 BC, in a very cursive script of Ptolemaic type; and though each has non-Egyptian features the general character indicates a uniformity of style in the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The development of the Ptolemaic book-hand is difficult to trace, as there are few examples, mostly not datable on external grounds. Only for the 3rd century BC have we a secure basis. The hands of that period have an angular appearance; there is little uniformity in the size of individual letters, and though sometimes, notably in the [[Flinders Petrie|Petrie papyrus]] containing the ''[[Phaedo]]'' of [[Plato]], a style of considerable delicacy is attained, the book-hand in general shows less mastery than the contemporary cursive. In the 2nd century the letters grew rounder and more uniform in size, but in the 1st century there is perceptible, here as in the cursive hand, a certain disintegration. Probably at no time did the Ptolemaic book-hand acquire such unity of stylistic effect as the cursive.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lewis Campbell, "On the Text of the Papyrus Fragment of the Phaedo", ''Classical Review'', Volume 5, Issue 10, December 1891, pp. 454–457, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3766440 published online: 27 October 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman period ===
[[File:HARRIS HOMER - 1st CENTURY B.C..JPG|thumb|left|Greek papyrus with [[Homer]]'s verses, 1st century BC]]

Papyri of the Roman period are far more numerous and show greater variety. The cursive of the 1st century has a rather broken appearance, part of one character being often made separately from the rest and linked to the next letter. A form characteristic of the 1st and 2nd century and surviving after that only as a fraction sign (=&lt;big&gt;⅛&lt;/big&gt;) is '''η''' in the shape [[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]. By the end of the 1st century, there had been developed several excellent types of cursive, which, though differing considerably both in the forms of individual letters and in general appearance, bear a family likeness to one another. Qualities which are specially noticeable are roundness in the shape of letters, continuity of formation, the pen being carried on from character to character, and regularity, the letters not differing strikingly in size and projecting strokes above or below the line being avoided. Sometimes, especially in tax-receipts and in stereotyped formulae, cursiveness is carried to an extreme. In a letter of the prefect, dated in 209, we have a fine example of the [[Chancery hand]], with tall and laterally compressed letters, '''ο''' very narrow and '''α''' and '''ω''' often written high in the line. This style, from at least the latter part of the 2nd century, exercised considerable influence on the local hands, many of which show the same characteristics less pronounced; and its effects may be traced into the early part of the 4th century. Hands of the 3rd century uninfluenced by it show a falling off from the perfection of the 2nd century; stylistic uncertainty and a growing coarseness of execution mark a period of decline and transition.

[[File:Herculanean Rolls - Papyrus 157-152.JPG|thumb|Copy of Herculanean Rolls, Greek papyrus 157–152]]

Several different types of book-hand were used in the Roman period. Particularly handsome{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} is a round, upright hand seen, for example, in a [[British Museum]] papyrus containing ''[[Odyssey]]'' III. The cross-stroke of '''ε''' is high, '''Μ''' deeply curved and '''Α''' has the form '''α'''. Uniformity of size is well attained, and a few strokes project, and these but slightly, above or below the line. Another type, well called by palaeographer Schubart the "severe" style, has a more angular appearance and not infrequently slopes to the right; though handsome, it has not the sumptuous appearance of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wilhelm Schubart, ''Griechische Palaeographie'', C.H. Beck, 1925, vol. i, pt. 4; also 1st half of new ed. of Muller's ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft''; and Schubart's ''Das Buch bei den Griechen und Römern'' (2nd ed.); ''ibid.'', ''Papyri Graecae Berolinenses'' (Boon, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt; There are various classes of a less pretentious style, in which convenience rather than beauty was the first consideration and no pains were taken to avoid irregularities in the shape and alignment of the letters. Lastly may be mentioned a hand which is of great interest as being the ancestor of the type called (from its later occurrence in [[vellum]] codices of the [[Bible]]) the biblical hand. This, which can be traced back at least the late 2nd century, has a square, rather heavy appearance; the letters, of uniform size, stand upright, and thick and thin strokes are well distinguished. In the 3rd century the book-hand, like the cursive, appears to have deteriorated in regularity and stylistic accomplishment.

In the charred rolls found at [[Herculaneum]] and dating from about the beginning of our era, are specimens of Greek literary hands from outside Egypt; and a comparison with the Egyptian papyri reveals great similarity in style and shows that conclusions drawn from the henads of Egypt may, with caution, be applied to the development of writing in the Greek world generally.

=== Byzantine period ===
{{See also|Byzantine text-type}}
[[File:Codex Alexandrinus 1 Tim 3,16.jpg|thumb|left|Section of the [[Codex Alexandrinus]], the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the [[Gospels]].]]
The cursive hand of the 4th century shows some uncertainty of character. Side by side with the style founded on the [[Chancery hand]], regular in formation and with tall and narrow letters, which characterised the period of [[Diocletian]], and lasted well into the century, we find many other types mostly marked by a certain looseness and irregularity. A general progress towards a florid and sprawling hand is easily recognisable, but a consistent and deliberate style was hardly evolved before the 5th century, from which unfortunately few dated documents have survived. [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] cursive tends to an exuberant hand, in which the long strokes are excessively extended and individual letters often much enlarged. But not a few hands of the 5th and 6th centuries are truly handsome and show considerable technical accomplishment. Both an upright and a sloping type occur and there are many less ornamental hands, but there gradually emerged towards the 7th century two general types, one (especially used in letters and contracts) a current hand, sloping to the right, with long strokes in such characters at '''τ''', '''ρ''', '''ξ''', '''η''' (which has the &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt; shape), '''ι''', and '''κ''', and with much linking of letters, and another (frequent in accounts), which shows, at least in essence, most of the forms of the later minuscule. (cf. [[#Minuscule Hand|below]].) This is often upright, though a slope to the right is quite common, and sometimes, especially in one or two documents of the early [[Arabic alphabet|Arab]] period, it has an almost [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] effect.

In the Byzantine period, the book-hand, which in earlier times had more than once approximated to the contemporary cursive, diverged widely from it.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

=== Vellum and paper manuscripts ===
The change from papyrus to [[vellum]] involved no such modification in the forms of letters as followed that from metal to papyrus. The justification for considering the two materials separately is that after the general adoption of vellum, the Egyptian evidence is first supplemented and later superseded by that of [[manuscript]]s from elsewhere, and that during this period the hand most used was one not previously employed for literary purposes.

==== Uncial hand ====
{{See also|Uncial script}}
{{double image|right|Codex Vaticanus B, 2Thess. 3,11-18, Hebr. 1,1-2,2.jpg|160|Codex Marchalianus Pg 71.JPG|160|Pages from [[Codex Vaticanus]] (left) and [[Codex Marchalianus]] (right)}}

The prevailing type of book-hand during what in [[papyrology]] is called the Byzantine period, that is, roughly from AD 300 to 650, is known as the biblical hand. It went back to at least the end of the 2nd century and had had originally no special connection with [[Christian literature]]. In [[manuscript]]s, whether vellum or paper, of the 4th century found in Egypt are met other forms of script, particularly a sloping, rather inelegant hand derived from the literary hand of the 3rd century, which persisted to at least the 5th century; but the three great early codices of the Bible are all written in uncials of the biblical type. In the [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], placed in the 4th century, the characteristics of the hand are least strongly marked; the letters have the forms characteristic of the type but without the heavy appearance of later manuscripts, and the general impression is one of greater roundness. In the [[Sinaiticus]], which is not much later, the letters are larger and more heavily made; and in the [[Alexandrinus]] (5th century) a later development is seen, with emphatic distinction of thick and thin strokes. By the 6th century, alike in vellum and in papyrus manuscripts, the heaviness had become very marked, though the hand still retained, in its best examples, a handsome appearance; but after this it steadily deteriorated, becoming ever more mechanical and artificial. The thick strokes grew heavier; the cross strokes of '''T''' and '''Θ''' and the base of '''Δ''' were furnished with drooping spurs. The hand, which is often singularly ugly, passed through various modifications, now sloping, now upright, though it is not certain that these variations were really successive rather than concurrent. A different type of uncials, derived from the [[Chancery hand]] and seen in two papyrus examples of the Festal letters despatched annually by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], was occasionally used, the best known example being the [[Codex Marchalianus]] (6th or 7th century). A combination of this hand with the other type is also known.

==== Minuscule hand ====
The uncial hand lingered on, mainly for liturgical manuscripts, where a large and easily legible script was serviceable, as late as the 12th century, but in ordinary use it had long been superseded by a new type of hand, the [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]], which originated in the 8th century, as an adaptation to literary purposes of the second of the types of Byzantine cursive mentioned above. A first attempt at a calligraphic use of this hand, seen in one or two manuscripts of the 8th or early 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P.F. de' Cavalieri &amp; J. Lietzmann, ''Specimina Codicum Graecorum Vaticanorum'' No. 5, Bonn, 1910; G. Vitelli &amp; C. Paoli, ''Collezione fiorentina di facsimili paleografici'', Florence (rist. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; in which it slopes to the right and has a narrow, angular appearance, did not find favour, but by the end of the 9th century a more ornamental type, from which modern Greek script descended, was already established. It has been suggested that it was evolved in the [[Monastery of Stoudios]] at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. T.W. Allen, "Notes on Abbreviations in Greek Manuscripts", ''Joun. Hell. Stud.'', xl, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest examples it is upright and exact but lacks flexibility; accents are small, [[Greek diacritics|breathings]] square in formation, and in general only such [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] are used as involve no change in the shape of letters. The single forms have a general resemblance (with considerable differences in detail) both to the minuscule cursive of late papyri, and to those used in modern Greek type; uncial forms were avoided.

In the course of the 10th century the hand, without losing its beauty and exactness, gained in freedom. Its finest period was from the 9th to the 12th century,{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} after which it rapidly declined. The development was marked by a tendency
# to the intrusion, in growing quantity, of uncial forms which good scribes could fit into the line without disturbing the unity of style but which, in less expert hands, had a disintegrating effect;
# to the disproportionate enlargement of single letters, especially at the beginnings and ends of lines;
# to ligatures, often very fantastic, which quite changed the forms of letters;
# to the enlargement of accents, breathings at the same time acquiring the modern rounded form.
But from the first there were several styles, varying from the formal, regular hands characteristic of service books to the informal style, marked by numerous abbreviations, used in manuscripts intended only for a scholar's private use. The more formal hands were exceedingly conservative, and there are few classes of script more difficult to date than the Greek minuscule of this class. In the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries a sloping hand, less dignified than the upright, formal type, but often very handsome, was especially used for manuscripts of the classics.

Hands of the 11th century are marked in general (though there are exceptions) by a certain grace and delicacy, exact but easy; those of the 12th by a broad, bold sweep and an increasing freedom, which readily admits uncial forms, ligatures and enlarged letters but has not lost the sense of style and decorative effect. In the 13th and still more in the 14th centuries there was a steady decline; the less formal hands lost their beauty and exactness, becoming ever more disorderly and chaotic in their effect, while formal style imitated the precision of an earlier period without attaining its freedom and naturalness, and often appears singularly lifeless. In the 15th century, especially in the West, where Greek scribes were in request to produce manuscripts of the classical authors, there was a revival, and several manuscripts of this period, though markedly inferior to those of the 11th and 12th centuries, are by no means without beauty.

=== Accents, punctuation, and division of words ===
[[File:Paragraphos.png|thumb|Variants of [[paragraphos]]]]
{{See also|Punctuation}}
In the book-hand of early papyri, neither accents nor breathings were employed. Their use was established by the beginning of the Roman period, but was sporadic in papyri, where they were used as an aid to understanding, and therefore more frequently in poetry than prose, and in lyrical oftener than in other verse. In the cursive of papyri they are practically unknown, as are marks of punctuation. Punctuation was effected in early papyri, literary and documentary, by spaces, reinforced in the book-hand by the [[paragraphos]], a horizontal stroke under the beginning of the line. The [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]], a more elaborate form of this, marked the beginning of lyrics or the principal sections of a longer work. Punctuation marks, the [[comma]], the high, low and middle points, were established in the book-hand by the Roman period; in early Ptolemaic papyri, a double point (''':''') is found.

In vellum and paper manuscripts, punctuation marks and accents were regularly used from at least the 8th century, though with some differences from modern practice. At no period down to the invention of printing did Greek scribes consistently separate words. The book-hand of papyri aimed at an unbroken succession of letters, except for distinction of sections; in cursive hands, especially where abbreviations were numerous, some tendency to separate words may be recognised, but in reality it was phrases or groups of letters rather than words which were divided. In the later minuscule word-division is much commoner but never became systematic, accents and breathings serving of themselves to indicate the proper division.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

{{See also|Linguistic history of the Indian subcontinent}}
The view that the art of writing in [[India]] developed gradually, as in other areas of the world, by going through the stages of pictographic, ideographic and transitional phases of the phonetic script, which in turn developed into syllabic and alphabetic scripts was challenged by Falk and others in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schrift im alten Indien: ein Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen|first=Harry|last=Falk|date=1993|publisher=G. Narr|isbn=3823342711|location=Tübingen|oclc=29443654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new paradigm, Indian alphabetic writing, called [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]], was discontinuous with earlier, undeciphered, glyphs, and was invented specifically by King [[Ashoka]] for application in his royal [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]]. In the subcontinent, three scripts like Indus, [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] and [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]] became prevalent. In addition, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic script]]s were also added to the Indian context after their penetration in the early centuries of the [[common era]] (CE). The decipherment and subsequent development of Indus glyphs is also a matter for continuing research and discussion. After a lapse of a few centuries the Kharoṣṭhī script became obsolete; the Greek script in India went through a similar fate and disappeared. But the Brāhmī and Arabic scripts endured for a much longer period. Moreover, there was a change and development in the Brāhmī script which may be traced in time and space through the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]], [[Kushan Empire|Kuṣāṇa]], [[Gupta script|Gupta]] and early medieval periods. The present day [[Nāgarī script]] is derived from Brāhmī. The Brāhmī is also the ancestral script of many other Indian scripts, in northern and southern South Asia. Legends and inscriptions in Brāhmī are engraved upon leather, wood, terracotta, ivory, stone, copper, bronze, silver and gold. Arabic got an important place, particularly in the royalty, during the medieval period and it provides rich material for history writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1995|title=Review: On the Origin of the Early Indian Scripts|jstor=604670|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=115|issue=2|pages=271–279|doi=10.2307/604670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the available inscriptions and manuscripts written in the above scripts—in languages like [[Prakrit|Prākrita]], [[Pali|Pāḷi]], [[Sanskrit|Saṃskṛta]], [[Apabhraṃśa]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]—have been read and exploited for history writing, but numerous inscriptions preserved in different museums still remain undeciphered for lack of competent palaeographic Indologists, as there is a gradual decline in the subcontinent of such disciplines as palaeography, [[epigraphy]] and [[numismatics]]. The discipline of ancient Indian scripts and the languages they are written needs new scholars who, by adopting traditional palaeographic methods and modern technology, may decipher, study and transcribe the various types of epigraphs and legends still extant today.&lt;ref&gt;There are few available texts relating to "Indian palaeography", among which Ahmad Hasan Dani, ''Indian Palaeography'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1997; A. C. Burnell, ''Elements of South-Indian Palaeography, from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century AD'', repr. 2012; Rajbali Pandey, ''Indian Palaeography'', Motilal Banarasi Das, 1957; Naresh Prasad Rastogi, ''Origin of Brāhmī Script: The Beginning of Alphabet in India'', Chowkhamba Saraswatibhawan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195099842|location=New York|oclc=252595337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the earliest written records, that is, the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], is [[Prakrit]]. Besides Prakrit, the Ashokan edicts are also written in Greek and Aramaic. Moreover, all the edicts of [[Ashoka]] engraved in the Kharoshthi and Brahmi scripts are in the Prakrit language: thus, originally the language employed in the inscriptions was Prakrit, with Sanskrit adopted at a later stage. Past the period of the [[Maurya Empire]], the use of Prakrit continued in inscriptions for a few more centuries. In north India, Prakrit was replaced by Sanskrit by the end of the 3rd century, while this change took place about a century later in south India. Some of the inscriptions though written in Prakrit, were influenced by Sanskrit and vice versa. The epigraphs of the Kushana kings are found in a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit, while the Mathura inscriptions of the time of Sodasa, belonging to the first quarter of the 1st century, contain verses in classical Sanskrit. From the 4th century onwards, the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] came to power and made Sanskrit flourish by supporting it in language and literature.

In western India and also in some regions of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]], Prakrit was used till the 4th century, mostly in the [[Buddhist]] writings though in a few contemporary records of the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]], Sanskrit was applied. The inscription of [[Yajna Sri Satakarni]] (2nd century) from [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] is considered to be the earliest so far. The earlier writings (4th century) of Salankayanas of the [[Telugu people|Telugu region]] are in Prakrit, while their later records (belonging to the 5th century) are written in Sanskrit. In the [[Kannada language|Kannada speaking area]], inscriptions belonging to later Satavahanas and Chutus were written in Prakrit. From the 4th century onwards, with the rise of the Guptas, Sanskrit became the predominant language of India and continued to be employed in texts and inscriptions of all parts of India along with the regional languages in the subsequent centuries. The copper-plate charters of the [[Pallavas]], the [[Cholas]] and the [[Pandyas]] documents are written in both Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Kannada is used in texts dating from about the 5th century and the [[Halmidi inscription]] is considered to be the earliest [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] written in the [[Kannada language]]. Inscriptions in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] began to appear from the 6th or 7th century. [[Malayalam]] made its beginning in writings from the 15th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Indi"&gt;For this section cf.

=== North India ===
[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|[[Rigveda]] manuscript in [[Devanāgarī]] (early 19th century)]]
{{See also|Kharosthi|Devanagari}}
In north India, the [[Brahmi]] script was used over a vast area; however, [[Ashoka]]n inscriptions are also found using [[Kharoshthi]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Greek script]]s. With the advent of the [[Saka]]-[[Western Kshatrapas|Kshatrapas]] and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] as political powers in north India, the writing system underwent a definite change due to the use of new writing tools and techniques. Further development of the Brahmi script and perceivable changes in its evolutionary trend can be discerned during the Gupta period: in fact, the [[Gupta script]] is considered to be the successor of the Kushana script in north India.

From the 6th to about the 10th century of the [[common era]], the inscriptions in north India were written in a script variously named, e.g., Siddhamatrika and Kutila ("Rañjanā script"). From the 8th century, Siddhamatrika developed into the [[Śāradā script]] in [[Kashmir]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]], into [[Bengali language|Proto-Bengali]] or Gaudi in [[Bengal]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and into [[Devanagari|Nagari]] in other parts of north India. [[Nāgarī script]] was used widely in northern India from the 10th century onwards. The use of [[Nandinagari]], a variant of [[Nagari script]], is mostly confined to the [[Karnataka]] region.

In central India, mostly in [[Madhya Pradesh]], the inscriptions of the [[Vakatakas]], and the kings of [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty|Sarabhapura]] and [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]] were written in what are known as "box-headed" and "nail-headed" characters. It may be noted that the early [[Kadambas]] of [[Karnataka]] also employed "nail-headed" characters in some of their inscriptions. During the 3rd–4th century, the script used in the inscriptions of [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]] developed a unique style of letter-forms with elongated verticals and artistic flourishes, which did not continue after their rule.&lt;ref name="Indi" /&gt;

=== South India ===
The earliest attested form of writing in [[South India]] is represented by inscriptions found in caves, associated with the [[Chalukya]] and [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] dynasties. These are written in variants of what is known as the [[Cave character]], and their script differs from the Northern version in being more angular. Most of the modern scripts of South India have evolved from this script, with the exception of [[Vatteluttu]], the exact origins of which are unknown, and [[Nandinagari]], which is a variant of [[Devanagari]] that developed due to later Northern influence. In south India from the 7th century of the common era onwards, a number of inscriptions belonging to the dynasties of Pallava, Chola and Pandya are found. These records are written in three different scripts known as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Vattezhuttu]] and [[Grantha script]]s, the last variety being used to write Sanskrit inscriptions. In the [[Kerala]] region, the Vattezhuttu script developed into a still more cursive script called [[Kolezhuthu]] during the 14th and 15th centuries. At the same time, the modern [[Malayalam]] script developed out of the Grantha script. The early form of the [[Telugu-Kannada script]] is found in the inscriptions of the early [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]] of [[Banavasi]] and the early [[Chalukyas of Badami]] in the west, and [[Salankayana]] and the early Eastern Chalukyas in the east who ruled the Kannada and Telugu speaking areas respectively, during the 4th to 7th centuries.

== Latin ==
{{See also|History of the Latin alphabet}}
Attention should be drawn at the outset to certain fundamental definitions and principles of the science. The original characters of an alphabet are modified by the material and the implements used. When stone and chisel are discarded for papyrus and reed-pen, the hand encounters less resistance and moves more rapidly. This leads to changes in the size and position of the letters, and then to the joining of letters, and, consequently, to altered shapes. We are thus confronted at an early date with quite distinct types. The majuscule style of writing, based on two parallel lines, '''ADPL''', is opposed to the minuscule, based on a system of four lines, with letters of unequal height, '''adpl'''. Another classification, according to the care taken in forming the letters, distinguishes between the set book-hand and the cursive script. The difference in this case is determined by the subject matter of the text; the writing used for books (''scriptura libraria'') is in all periods quite distinct from that used for letters and documents (''epistolaris, diplomatica''). While the set book-hand, in majuscule or minuscule, shows a tendency to stabilise the forms of the letters, the cursive, often carelessly written, is continually changing in the course of years and according to the preferences of the writers.

This being granted, a summary survey of the morphological history of the [[Latin alphabet]] shows the zenith of its modifications at once, for its history is divided into two very unequal periods, the first dominated by majuscule and the second by minuscule writing.&lt;ref name="Bouar"&gt;The contents of the following sections on {{small caps|Latin palaeography}}—especially the parts relating to "Minuscule writing"—are mainly based on the specialist writings consulted and cited throughout the text, from the following sources: primarily the article on ''Latin handwriting'' by French palaeographist A. de Bouard, present {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Palaeography#Latin Writing I |display=Palaeography § Latin Writing |volume=20 |pages=567–573}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/567/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; the requisite [http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf ''Fonts for Latin Palaeography – User's manual''], by Juan-Jose Marcos, 2011; Schiapparelli, ''La scrittura latina nell'età romana'', 1921; Giorgio Cencetti, ''Paleografia latina'', Jouvence, 2002; [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Paleografia latina. Antichità e Medioevo'', Antenore, 2000 (Ital. ed.); [[Edward Maunde Thompson]], ''An Introduction to Greek and Latin Palaeography, cit.''  These two introductory paragraphs are directly quoted from the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview ===
[[Jean Mabillon]], a French Benedictine monk, scholar and [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], whose work ''De re diplomatica'' was published in 1681, is widely regarded as the founder of the twin disciplines of palaeography and [[diplomatics]]. However, the actual term "palaeography" was coined (in Latin) by [[Bernard de Montfaucon]], a [[Benedictine monk]], in the title of his ''Palaeographia Graeca'' (1708), which remained a standard work in the specific field of Greek palaeography for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard de Montfaucon et al., ''Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum'', Paris, Ludovicum Guerin (1708).&lt;/ref&gt; With their establishment of palaeography, Mabillon and his fellow Benedictines were responding to the Jesuit [[Daniel Papebroch]], who doubted the authenticity of some of the documents which the Benedictines offered as credentials for the authorisation of their monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament'' Fourth Edition (Oxford University, 2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century such scholars as [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]], [[Leopold Delisle]] and [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]] contributed greatly to making palaeography independent from diplomatic. In the 20th century, the 'New French School' of palaeographers, especially [[Jean Mallon]], gave a new direction to the study of scripts by stressing the importance of ductus (the shape and order of the strokes used to compose letters) in studying the historical development of scripts.&lt;ref name=fn_2&gt;R. Marichal, "Paleography" in New Encyclopaedia New York: Gale-Thomson, 2003 Vol. X, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Majuscule writing ===
==== Capital writing ====
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio14 [[recto]] of the [[Vergilius Romanus]] written in [[rustic capitals]], also contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]].]]

The [[Latin alphabet]] first appears in the epigraphic type of [[majuscule]] writing, known as capitals. These characters form the main stem from which developed all the branches of Latin writing. On the oldest monuments (the ''inscriptiones bello Hannibalico antiquiores'' of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum = CIL]]''), it is far from showing the orderly regularity of the later period. Side by side with upright and square characters are angular and sloping forms, sometimes very distorted, which seem to indicate the existence of an early cursive writing from which they would have been borrowed. Certain literary texts clearly allude to such a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry B. Van Hoesen, [https://archive.org/details/romancursivewri00hoesgoog ''Roman Cursive Writing''], Princeton University Press, 1915, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the characters of the cursive type were progressively eliminated from formal inscriptions, and capital writing reached its perfection in the [[History of Rome|Augustan Age]].

Epigraphists divide the numerous inscriptions of this period into two quite distinct classes: ''tituli'', or formal inscriptions engraved on stone in elegant and regular capitals, and ''acta'', or legal texts, documents, etc., generally engraved on bronze in cramped and careless capitals. Palaeography inherits both these types. Reproduced by scribes on papyrus or parchment, the elegant characters of the inscriptions become the square capitals of the manuscripts, and the ''actuaria'', as the writing of the ''acta'' is called, becomes the [[rustic capital]].

Of the many books written in square capitals, the ''éditions de luxe'' of ancient times, only a few fragments have survived, the most famous being pages from manuscripts of [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Émile Chatelain]], [http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/classics/index.asp ''Paléographie des classiques latins''], pl. LXI-II, LXXV; ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', viii, 1,098.&lt;/ref&gt; The finest examples of rustic capitals, the use of which is attested by papyri of the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl Zangemeister &amp; Wilhelm Wattenbach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wuTEXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Exempla codicum Latinorum''], Koester, 1876, pl. I-II.&lt;/ref&gt; are to be found in manuscripts of Virgil&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 113-117; ''Archivio paleografico italiano'', i, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terence]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pal. Soc.'', pl. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these forms of capital writing offers any difficulty in reading, except that no space is left between the words. Their dates are still uncertain, in spite of attempts to determine them by minute observation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Karl Franz Otto Dziatzko]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=nHM2QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Untersuchungen über ausgewählte Kapitel des antiken Buchwesens''], BiblioBazaar, repr. 2010; E.A. Lowe, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3572504 "More Facts about our Oldest Latin Manuscripts"], in the ''Classical Quarterly'', vol. xix, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rustic capitals, more practical than the square forms, soon came into general use. This was the standard form of writing, so far as books are concerned, until the 5th century, when it was replaced by a new type, the uncial, which is discussed below.

==== Early cursive writing ====
While the set book-hand, in square or rustic capitals, was used for the copying of books, the writing of everyday life, letters and documents of all kinds, was in a cursive form, the oldest examples of which are provided by the [[graffiti]] on walls at [[Pompeii]] (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', iv), a series of waxen tablets, also discovered at Pompeii (''CIL'', iv, supplement), a similar series found at [[Verespatak]] in [[Transylvania]] (''CIL'', iii) and a number of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Carl Wessely]], [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=ha001159476 ''Schrifttafeln zur älteren lateinischen Palaeographie''], Leipzig, E. Avenarius; ''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, passim''; Vincenzo Federici, ''Esempi di corsivo antico''; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; From a study of a number of documents which exhibit transitional forms, it appears that this cursive was originally simplified capital writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Franz Steffens, [http://www.paleography.unifr.ch/schrifttafeln.htm ''Lateinische Paläographie'' – digital version''], 2nd ed., pl. 3 {{de icon}}; Wessely, ''Studien'', xiv, pl. viii; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution was so rapid, however, that at quite an early date the ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world can no longer be described as capitals. By the 1st century, this kind of writing began to develop the principal characteristics of two new types: the [[Uncial script|uncial]] and the [[minuscule cursive]]. With the coming into use of writing surfaces which were smooth, or offered little resistance, the unhampered haste of the writer altered the shape, size and position of the letters. In the earliest specimens of writing on wax, plaster or papyrus, there appears a tendency to represent several straight strokes by a single curve. The cursive writing thus foreshadows the specifically uncial forms. The same specimens show great inequality in the height of the letters; the main strokes are prolonged upwards ([[File:Hand 1 sample b 1.png|20px]]= '''b'''; [[File:Hand 10 sample d 2.png|20px]]= '''d''') or downwards ([[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]= '''q'''; [[File:Hand 4 sample s 2.png|15px]] = '''s'''). In this direction, the cursive tends to become a minuscule hand.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== Uncial writing ====
Although the characteristic forms of the uncial type appear to have their origin in the early cursive,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Edward Maunde Thompson]], [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft ''Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography''], ''s.v.''; Van Hoesen, ''The Parentage and Birthdate of the Latin Uncial'', in ''Transactions and Proceedings'' of the [[American Philological Association]], xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a ''libraria'', closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally [[File:Hand 1 sample A mag 2.png|28px]] [[File:Uncial d.png|15px]] [[File:Uncial e.png|15px]] [[File:Hand 2 sample m 1.png|30px]]. It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by the latter part of the 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (''Exempla'', pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;A list is given in Traube, ''Vorlesungen'', i, pp. 171–261, and numerous reproductions in Zangemeister &amp; Wattenbach's ''Exempla'', and in Chatelain, ''Uncialis scriptura''.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Chatelain, ''Unc. script., explanatio tabularum''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest uncial writing is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected.

=== Minuscule cursive writing ===
[[File:Chronica archiepiscoporum Magdeburgensium 1r 25-C-4 (16764) Hs Kynžvart 91.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from the [[Magdeburg]]'s ''Chronica archiepiscoporum'']]

==== Early minuscule cursive ====
In the ancient cursive writing, from the 1st century onward, there are symptoms of transformation in the form of certain letters, the shape and proportions of which correspond more closely to the definition of minuscule writing than to that of majuscule. Rare and irregular at first, they gradually become more numerous and more constant and by degrees supplant the majuscule forms, so that in the history of the Roman cursive there is no precise boundary between the majuscule and minuscule periods.

The oldest example of minuscule cursive writing that has been discovered is a letter on papyrus, found in Egypt, dating from the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', iii, pl. i.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a highly important date in the history of Latin writing, for with only one known exception, not yet adequately explained—two fragments of imperial rescripts of the 5th century&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Theodor Mommsen]], ''Fragmente zweier Kaiserrescripte'' in ''Jahrbuch des gemeinen deutschen Rechts'', vi, 398; Preisigke in ''Schriften der wissensch. Gesellsch. in Strassburg'', xxx; ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;—the minuscule cursive was consequently the only ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world. The ensuing succession of documents&lt;ref&gt;For example, a certificate of AD 400 in Wessely, ''Studien, cit.'', xiv, pl. xiii; a letter of AD 444 in Wessely, ''Schrifttafeln, cit.'', pl. xii, No. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; show a continuous improvement in this form of writing, characterised by the boldness of the strokes and by the elimination of the last lingering majuscule forms. The [[Ravenna]] deeds of the 5th and 6th centuries&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gaetano Marini, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UBF4CR_Ax1kC&amp;redir_esc=y ''I Papiri diplomatici''], Lightning Source UK Ltd, repr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit this hand at its perfection.

At this period, the minuscule cursive made its appearance as a ''[[book hand]]'', first as marginal notes, and later for the complete books themselves. The only difference between the book-hand and that used for documents is that the principal strokes are shorter and the characters thicker. This form of the hand is usually called ''[[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]]''.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== National hands ====
The fall of the Empire and the establishment of the barbarians within its former boundaries did not interrupt the use of the Roman minuscule cursive hand, which was adopted by the newcomers. But for gaps of over a century in the chronological series of documents which have been preserved, it would be possible to follow the evolution of the Roman cursive into the so-called "national hands", forms of minuscule writing which flourished after the barbarian invasions in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]], and which are still known as [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]], [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Insular script|Irish]]. These names came into use at a time when the various national hands were believed to have been invented by the peoples who used them, but their connotation is merely geographical. Nevertheless, in spite of a close resemblance which betrays their common origin, these hands are specifically different, perhaps because the Roman cursive was developed by each nation in accordance with its artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luigi Schiapparelli, ''Note paleografiche'' in ''Archivio storico italiano'', lxxiv, p. 55; also his [https://archive.org/details/lascritturalatin00schi ''La scrittura latina nell' età romana (note paleografiche)''] (with 32 facsimiles), Como, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Lombardic writing''
[[File:Origo gentis Langobardorum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A 10th-century [[codex]] of ''Origo gentis Langobardorum'' from [[Reims]]]]
In Italy, after the close of the Roman and Byzantine periods, the writing is known as [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic]], a generic term which comprises several local varieties. These may be classified under four principal types: two for the ''scriptura epistolaris'', the old Italian cursive and the [[pope|papal]] [[chancery hand]], or ''littera romana'', and two for the ''libraria'', the old Italian book-hand and Lombardic in the narrow sense, sometimes known as ''Beneventana'' on account of the fact that it flourished in the principality of [[Benevento]].

The oldest preserved documents written in the old Italian cursive show all the essential characteristics of the Roman cursive of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Giuseppe Bonelli,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiYQAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Codice paleografico lombardo''], Hoepli, 1908; [https://archive.org/details/bullettino0102archuoft ''Archivio paleografico italiano, cit.''], i, iii, vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Italy, this hand began in the 9th century to be influenced by a minuscule book-hand which developed, as will be seen later, in the time of [[Charlemagne]]; under this influence it gradually disappeared, and ceased to exist in the course of the 12th century. In southern Italy, it persisted far on into the [[later Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Michele Russi, [https://archive.org/details/paleografiaedip00russgoog ''Paleografia e diplomatica de' documenti delle Province napolitane''], Naples, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; The papal chancery hand, a variety of Lombardic peculiar to the vicinity of [[Rome]] and principally used in papal documents, is distinguished by the formation of the letters ''a, e, q, t''. It is formal in appearance at first, but is gradually simplified, under the influence of the [[Carolingian minuscule]], which finally prevailed in the [[papal bull|bulls]] of [[Honorius II]] (1124–1130). The [[notaries public]] in Rome continued to use the papal chancery hand until the beginning of the 13th century. The old Italian book-hand is simply a semi-cursive of the type already described as in use in the 6th century. The principal examples are derived from ''[[scriptoria]]'' in northern Italy, where it was displaced by the Carolingian minuscule during the 9th century.  In southern Italy, this hand persisted, developing into a [[calligraphy|calligraphic form]] of writing, and in the 10th century took on a very artistic angular appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elias Avery Lowe, [https://archive.org/details/beneventanscript00loweuoft ''Beneventan Script''], Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1914; [[facsimile]]s in O. Piscicelli Taeggi, ''Paleografia artistica di Monte Cassino'', [[Montecassino]], 1876–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Exultet]]'' rolls provide the finest examples.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In the 9th century, it was introduced in [[Dalmatia]] by the [[Benedictine monks]] and developed there, as in [[Apulia]], on the basis of the [[archetype]], culminating in a rounded ''[[Beneventan script|Beneventana]]'' known as the ''Bari type''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Viktor Novak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RWhzXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Scriptura Beneventana''], [[Zagreb]], 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Merovingian''
[[File:Merov.jpg|160px|left|thumb|8th-century [[Merovingian script]].]]
The offshoot of the Roman cursive which developed in [[Gaul]] under the first dynasty of kings is called [[Merovingian script|Merovingian writing]]. It is represented by thirty-eight royal diplomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lauer |first1=P. |last2=Samaran |first2=C. |oclc=461176420 |title=Les diplômes originaux des Mérovingiens: fac-similés phototypiques avec notices et transcriptions |location=Paris |publisher=E.

Picard et fils, 1904, pl. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less than a century intervenes between the Ravenna cursive and the oldest extant Merovingian document (AD 625), there is a great difference in appearance between the two writings. The facile flow of the former is replaced by a cramped style, in which the natural slope to the right gives way to an upright hand, and the letters, instead of being fully outlined, are compressed to such an extent that they modify the shape of other letters. Copyists of books used a cursive similar to that found in documents, except that the strokes are thicker, the forms more regular, and the heads and tails shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1887_num_48_1_462552 ''Album paléographique de la Société de l'École des chartes''], pl. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merovingian cursive as used in books underwent simplification in some localities, undoubtedly through the influence of the minuscule book-hand of the period. The two principal centres of this reform were [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil]] and [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Traube, ''Perrona Scottorum'' in ''Sitzungsberichte'' of the [[Munich Academy]], 1900; Liebart, ''Corbie Scriptorum'' in W.M. Lindsay's ''Palaeogr. Lat.'', i.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Visigothic''
[[File:AlfabetoVisigodo.png|thumb|160px|left|Alphabet in [[Visigothic script]].]]
In Spain, after the Visigothic conquest, the Roman cursive gradually developed special characteristics. Some documents attributed to the 7th century display a transitional hand with straggling and rather uncouth forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla scripturae visigothicae'', pl. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive features of Visigothic writing, the most noticeable of which is certainly the q-shaped '''g''', did not appear until later, in the book-hand. The book-hand became set at an early date. In the 8th century it appears as a sort of semi-cursive; the earliest example of certain date is [[manuscript|ms]] lxxxix in the [[Capitulary|Capitular]] [[Library]] in [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clark, ''Collectanea hispanica'', 63, pp. 129–130; Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital, cit.'', lxxxii, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century the calligraphic forms become broader and more rounded until the 11th century, when they become slender and angular.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous reproductions exists in the literature, cf. ''int. al.'', Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla, cit.''; Burnam, ''Paleogr. iberica''; Clark, ''Collectanea, cit.''; Garcia Villada, ''Paleogr. española''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Visigothic minuscule appears in a cursive form in documents about the middle of the 9th century, and in the course of time grows more intricate and consequently less legible.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Munoz, ''Paleogr. visigoda''; Garcia Villada, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; It soon came into competition with the Carolingian minuscule, which supplanted it as a result of the presence in Spain of French elements such as [[Cluniac monks]] and warriors engaged in the campaign against the [[Moors]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hessel, ''Ausbreitung der karolingischen Minuskel'' in ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', vii, viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish and Anglo-Saxon hands, which were not directly derived from the Roman minuscule cursive, will be discussed in a [[#Irish and Anglo-Saxon Writing|separate sub-section below]].

=== Set minuscule writing ===
One by one, the national minuscule cursive hands were replaced by a set minuscule hand which has already been mentioned and its origins may now be traced from the beginning.

==== Half-uncial writing ====
The early cursive was the medium in which the minuscule forms were gradually evolved from the corresponding majuscule forms. Minuscule writing was therefore cursive in its inception. As the minuscule letters made their appearance in the cursive writing of documents, they were adopted and given calligraphic form by the copyists of literary texts, so that the set minuscule alphabet was constituted gradually, letter by letter, following the development of the minuscule cursive. Just as some documents written in the early cursive show a mixture of majuscule and minuscule forms, so certain literary papyri of the 3rd century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, cit.'', iv, pl. vi, No. 668; xi, pl. vi, No. 1,379.&lt;/ref&gt; and inscriptions on stone of the 4th century&lt;ref&gt;''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 127-8; ''Arch. pal. ital., cit.'', v, pl. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; yield examples of a mixed set hand, with minuscule forms side by side with capital and uncial letters. The number of minuscule forms increases steadily in texts written in the mixed hand, and especially in marginal notes, until by the end of the 5th century the majuscule forms have almost entirely disappeared in some [[manuscript]]s. This quasi-minuscule writing, known as the "half-uncial"&lt;ref&gt;Cf. many examples in [[Émile Chatelain]], ''Semiuncial Script, passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; thus derives from a long line of mixed hands which, in a synoptic chart of [[Latin script]]s, would appear close to the oldest ''librariae'', and between them and the ''epistolaris'' (cursive), from which its characteristic forms were successively derived. It had a considerable influence on the continental ''scriptura libraria'' of the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Irish and Anglo-Saxon writing ====
The half-uncial hand was introduced in Ireland along with Latin culture in the 5th century by priests and laymen from [[Gaul]], fleeing before the barbarian invasions. It was adopted there to the exclusion of the cursive, and soon took on a distinct character. There are two well established classes of Irish writing as early as the 7th century: a large round half-uncial hand, in which certain majuscule forms frequently appear, and a pointed hand, which becomes more cursive and more genuinely minuscule. The latter developed out of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wolfgang Keller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IKA3QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Angelsächsische Palaeographie''], Mayer &amp; Müller, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the distinguishing marks of manuscripts of Irish origin is to be found in the initial letters, which are ornamented by interlacing, animal forms, or a frame of red dots. The most certain evidence, however, is provided by the system of abbreviations and by the combined square and cuneiform appearance of the minuscule at the height of its development.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital., cit.'', lxxiv, ii, pp. 1–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The two types of Irish writing were introduced in the north of Great Britain by the monks, and were soon adopted by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], being so exactly copied that it is sometimes difficult to determine the origin of an example. Gradually, however, the Anglo-Saxon writing developed a distinct style, and even local types,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Keller, ''op. cit.''; W.M. Lindsay, [https://archive.org/details/earlywelshscript00lind ''Early Welsh Script''], Oxford: J. Parker &amp; Co., 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; which were superseded after the Norman conquest by the Carolingian minuscule. Through [[St Columba]] and his followers, Irish writing spread to the continent, and manuscripts were written in the Irish hand in the monasteries of [[Bobbio Abbey]] and [[St Gall]] during the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Pre-Caroline ====
James J. John points out that the disappearance of imperial authority around the end of the 5th century in most of the Latin-speaking half of the Roman Empire does not entail the disappearance of the Latin scripts, but rather introduced conditions that would allow the various provinces of the West gradually to drift apart in their writing habits, a process that began around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;James J. John, "Latin Paleography", in J. Powell, ''Medieval Studies'', 2nd. ed. (Syracuse: [[Syracuse University Press]], 1992), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great, d. 604) was influential in the spread of Christianity to Britain and also sent Queens Theodelinde and Brunhilda, as well as Spanish bishops, copies of manuscripts. Furthermore, he sent the Roman monk [[Augustine of Canterbury]] to Britain on a missionary journey, on which Augustine may have brought manuscripts. Although Italy's dominance as a centre of manuscript production began to decline, especially after the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the invasions by the [[Lombards]], its manuscripts—and more important, the scripts in which they were written—were distributed across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', trans. Daibi O Croinin and David Ganz (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1990), pp. 83–112; 190–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th through the 8th centuries, a number of so-called 'national hands' were developed throughout the Latin-speaking areas of the former Roman Empire. By the late 6th century Irish scribes had begun transforming Roman scripts into Insular minuscule and majuscule scripts. A series of transformations, for book purposes, of the cursive documentary script that had grown out of the later Roman cursive would get under way in France by the mid-7th century. In Spain half-uncial and cursive would both be transformed into a new script, the Visigothic minuscule, no later than the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;John, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carolingian minuscule ====
[[File:Charlemagne miniscule.jpg|thumb|200px|A page in [[Carolingian minuscule]] (''[[Book of Exodus]]'')]]
Beginning in the 8th century, as [[Charlemagne]] began to consolidate power over a large area of western Europe, scribes developed a minuscule script ([[Caroline minuscule]]) that effectively became the standard script for manuscripts from the 9th to the 11th centuries. The origin of this hand is much disputed. This is due to the confusion which prevailed before the Carolingian period in the ''libraria'' in France, Italy and Germany as a result of the competition between the cursive and the set hands. In addition to the calligraphic uncial and half-uncial writings, which were imitative forms, little used and consequently without much vitality, and the minuscule cursive, which was the most natural hand, there were innumerable varieties of mixed writing derived from the influence of these hands on each other. In some, the uncial or half-uncial forms were preserved with little or no modification, but the influence of the cursive is shown by the freedom of the strokes; these are known as rustic, semi-cursive or cursive uncial or half-uncial hands. Conversely, the cursive was sometimes affected, in varying degrees, by the set ''librariae''; the cursive of the ''epistolaris'' became a semi-cursive when adopted as a ''libraria''. Nor is this all. Apart from these reciprocal influences affecting the movement of the hand across the page, there were [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] influences at work, letters being borrowed from one alphabet for another. This led to compromises of all softs and of infinite variety between the uncial and half-uncial and the cursive. It will readily be understood that the origin of the Carolingian minuscule, which must be sought in this tangle of pre-Carolingian hands, involves disagreement. The new writing is admittedly much more closely related to the ''epistolaris'' than the primitive minuscule; this is shown by certain forms, such as the open '''''a''''' ([[File:Hand 1.1 sample a 2.png|20px]]), which recall the cursive, by the joining of certain letters, and by the clubbing of the tall letters '''''b d h l''''', which resulted from a cursive ''[[Ductus (linguistics)|ductus]]''. Most palaeographers agree in assigning the new hand the place shown in the following table:&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''Epistolaris''
! colspan="5" | ''Librariæ''

| Half-uncial
| Rustic uncial&lt;br /&gt;and half-uncial
| Pre-Carolingian&lt;br /&gt;Carolingian
| Semi-cursive
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
Controversy turns on the question whether the Carolingian minuscule is the primitive minuscule as modified by the influence of the cursive or a cursive based on the primitive minuscule. Its place of origin is also uncertain: Rome, the [[Palatine]] school, [[Tours]], [[Reims]], [[Metz]], [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and [[Corbie]] have been suggested, but no agreement has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', Harald Steinacker in ''Miscellanea Francesco Ehrle'', Rome, 1924, iv, pp. 126ff; G. Cencetti, "Postilla nuova a un problema paleografico vecchio: l'origine della minuscola carolina", in ''Nova Historia'', 1955, pp. 1–24; B. Bischoff, ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages, cit.'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the appearance of the new hand is a turning point in the history of culture. So far as Latin writing is concerned, it marks the dawn of [[Early modern period|modern times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Thompson |first=Edward Maunde |wstitle=Palaeography |volume=20 |pages=556–579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic minuscule ====
In the 12th century, Carolingian minuscule underwent a change in its appearance and adopted bold and broken [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] letter-forms. This style remained predominant, with some regional variants, until the 15th century, when the [[Renaissance]] [[humanism|humanistic]] scripts revived a version of Carolingian minuscule. It then spread from the Italian [[Renaissance]] all over Europe.

== Rise of modern writing ==
[[File:HS 140 38 object 210168 - Frontispice of the Towns Register, the so called 'Stadtbuch', of Bozen-Bolzano (South Tyrol) from 1472.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece, handwritten in [[Early New High German]], of the so-called 'Stadtbuch' from [[Bolzano]], dated 1472&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Obermair | first = Hannes | author-link = Hannes Obermair | contribution = Das Bozner Stadtbuch: Handschrift 140 – das Amts- und Privilegienbuch der Stadt Bozen | editor = Stadtarchiv Bozen | title = Bozen: von den Grafen von Tirol bis zu den Habsburgern | series = Forschungen zur Bozner Stadtgeschichte | volume = 1 | pages = 399–432 | publisher = Verlagsanstalt Athesia | place = Bozen-Bolzano | year = 1999 | isbn =88-7014-986-2 | contribution-url = https://www.academia.edu/1282360/Das_Bozner_Stadtbuch_Handschrift_140_das_Amts-_und_Privilegienbuch_der_Stadt_Bozen }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
These humanistic scripts are the base for the [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]] and the handwriting forms in western and southern Europe. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], the ''[[Kurrentschrift]]'' was rooted in the [[cursive]] handwriting of the later [[Middle Ages]].  With the name of the [[calligrapher]] Ludwig [[Sütterlin]], this handwriting counterpart to the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s was abolished by [[Hitler]] in 1941. After [[World War II]], it was taught as an alternative script in some areas until the 1970s; it is no longer taught. [[Secretary hand]] is an informal business hand of the Renaissance.

=== Developments ===
[[File:Niccolo de Niccoli italic handwriting.jpg|thumb|Handwriting by [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]] (1364–1437), which served as the origin of [[italic type]].]]

There are undeniable points of contact between [[History of architecture|architecture]] and palaeography, and in both it is possible to distinguish a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The creative effort which began in the post-Carolingian period culminated at the beginning of the 12th century in a [[calligraphy]] and an architecture which, though still somewhat awkward, showed unmistakable signs of power and experience, and at the end of that century and in the first half of the 13th both arts reached their climax and made their boldest flights. The topography of later medieval writing is still being studied; national varieties can, of course, be' identified but the problem of distinguishing features becomes complicated as a result of the development of international relations, and the migration of clerks from one end of Europe to the other. During the later centuries of the [[Middle Ages]] the Gothic minuscule continued to improve within the restricted circle of ''de luxe'' editions and ceremonial documents. In common use, it degenerated into a cursive which became more and more intricate, full of superfluous strokes and complicated by abbreviations. In the first quarter of the 15th century an innovation took place which exercised a decisive influence on the evolution of writing in Europe. The Italian [[humanism|humanists]] were struck by the eminent legibility of the manuscripts, written in the improved Carolingian minuscule of the 10th and 11th centuries, in which they discovered the works of ancient authors, and carefully imitated the old writing. In [[Petrarch]]'s compact book hand, the wider leading and reduced compression and round curves are early manifestations of the reaction against the crabbed Gothic secretarial minuscule we know today as "[[Blackletter#Gothic minuscule|blackletter]]"; Petrarch was one of the few medieval authors to have written at any length on the handwriting of his time; in his essay on the subject, ''La scrittura''&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', discussed by Armando Petrucci, ''La scrittura di Francesco Petrarca'' (Vatican City) 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized the current scholastic hand, with its laboured strokes (''artificiosis litterarum tractibus'') and exuberant (''luxurians'') letter-forms amusing the eye from a distance, but fatiguing on closer exposure, as if written for other purpose than to be read. For Petrarch the gothic hand violated three principles: writing, he said, should be simple (''castigata''), clear (''clara'') and orthographically correct.&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', noted in Albert Derolez, "The script reform of Petrarch: an illusion?" in John Haines, Randall Rosenfeld, eds. ''Music and Medieval Manuscripts: paleography and performance'' 2006:5f; Derolez discusses the ''degree'' of Petrarch's often alluded-to reform.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boccaccio]] was a great admirer of Petrarch; from Boccaccio's immediate circle this post-Petrarchan "semi-gothic" revised hand spread to ''literati'' in [[Florence]], [[Lombardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Mirella Ferrari "La 'littera antiqua' a Milan, 1417–1439" in Johanne Autenrieth, ed. ''Renaissance- und Humanistenhandschriften'', (Munich:  Oldenbourg,) 1988:21–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Daniels, ''Boccaccio and the book: production and reading in Italy 1340–1520'', 2009:28.&lt;/ref&gt; A more thorough reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise was in the offing. The generator of the new style (''illustration'') was [[Poggio Bracciolini]], a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] script in the first decade of the 15th century. The Florentine bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]] recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] of ''lettera antica'' and had transcribed texts to support himself—presumably, as Martin Davies points out—&lt;ref&gt;Davies, in Kraye (ed.) 1996:51.&lt;/ref&gt; before he went to Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the [[papal curia]]. [[Berthold Ullman]] identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio's transcription of [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum|Epistles to Atticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script'' (Rome) 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the [[Medici]] library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the ''lettera antica''. The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Morison]], "Early humanistic script and the first roman type", reprinted in his ''Selected Essays on the History of Letter-Forms in Manuscript and Print'', ed. by David McKitterick, 2 vols. 1981:206-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coluccio Salutati]]. The [[papal chancery]] adopted the new fashion for some purposes, and thus contributed to its diffusion throughout [[Christendom]]. The printers played a still more significant part in establishing this form of writing by using it, from the year 1465, as the basis for their types. The humanistic minuscule soon gave rise to a sloping cursive hand, known as the Italian, which was also taken up by printers in search of novelty and thus became the [[italic type]]. In consequence, the [[Italic script|Italian hand]] became widely used, and in the 16th century began to compete with the Gothic cursive. In the 17th century, writing masters were divided between the two schools, and there was in addition a whole series of compromises. The Gothic characters gradually disappeared, except a few that survived in Germany. The Italian became universally used, brought to perfection in more recent times by English calligraphers.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

A '''paragraph''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] παράγραφος ''paragraphos'', "''to write beside''" or "''written beside''") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in [[writing]] dealing with a particular point or [[idea]]. A paragraph consists of one or more [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s.&lt;ref name="UNC" /&gt; Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer [[prose]].language

==History==

The oldest classical Greek and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in [[boustrophedon]] (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized, and [[word divider]]s and [[terminal punctuation]] became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original ''[[paragraphos]]'', similar to an [[underscore]] at the beginning of the new group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the English Paragraph|author=Edwin Herbert Lewis|date=1894|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DwjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''paragraphos'' evolved into the [[pilcrow]] (¶), which in English manuscripts in the [[Middle Ages]] can be seen inserted inline between sentences. The [[Fleuron (typography)|hedera leaf]] (e.g. ☙) has also been used in the same way.
[[File:United States Constitution.jpg|thumb|Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US Constitution]]

In ancient manuscripts, another means to divide sentences into paragraphs was a line break ([[newline]]) followed by an [[initial]] at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original [[Old English]] manuscript of [[Beowulf]]. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt;
Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by [[Indentation (typesetting)|indenting]] the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) [[United States Constitution]] from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph whitespace, or put in the indentation space.

A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double [[carriage return]] produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters (or [[word processing]] software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting [[leading]]. This style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the [[World Wide Web]] and [[email]].

==Typographical considerations==

[[Widows and orphans]] occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last line in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.

Professionally printed material in English typically does not indent the first paragraph, but indents those that follow. For example, [[Robert Bringhurst]] states that we should "Set opening paragraphs flush left."&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Elements of Typographic Style|last= Bringhurst|first=Robert|year= 2005|publisher= Hartley and Marks|location= Vancouver|isbn= 0-88179-206-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringhurst explains as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The function of a paragraph is to mark a pause, setting the paragraph apart from what precedes it. If a paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous and can therefore be omitted.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Elements of Typographic Style'' states that "at least one [[En space|en [space]]]" should be used to indent paragraphs after the first,&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005" /&gt; noting that that is the "practical minimum".&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005a"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Elements of Typographic Style|last= Bringhurst|first=Robert|year= 2005|publisher= Hartley and Marks|location= Vancouver|isbn= 0-88179-206-3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[em space]] is the most commonly used paragraph indent.&lt;ref name="Bringhurst2005a" /&gt; [[Miles Tinker]], in his book ''Legibility of Print'', concluded that indenting the first line of paragraphs increases [[readability]] by 7%, on the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Legibility of Print|last=Tinker|first=Miles A.|year= 1963|publisher= Iowa State University Press|location= Iowa|isbn= 0-8138-2450-8|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computing==
{{See also|Newline}}
In [[word processing]] and [[desktop publishing]], a '''hard return''' or '''paragraph break''' indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the '''soft return''' at the end of a line internal to a paragraph.
This distinction allows [[word wrap]] to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks.  The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.

How such documents are actually stored depends on the [[file format]].  For example, [[HTML]] uses the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tag as a paragraph container.  In [[plaintext]] files, there are two common formats.  Pre-formatted text will have a [[newline]] at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line.  An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.

A line break that is inserted manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a paragraph break, although this is typically not done in [[prose]]. [[HTML]]'s &amp;lt;br&amp;nbsp;/&amp;gt; tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the [[W3C]] recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each "paragraph" is a [[stanza]]), or in a [[street address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/br|title=&lt;br&gt;: The Line Break element|author=|date=|website=MDN Web Docs|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbering==
{{See also|Newline}}
Paragraphs are commonly numbered using the decimal system, where (in books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of magnitude. Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 ''[[A Course of Modern Analysis]]'', chapter 9 is devoted to Fourier Series; within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following section §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some properties of that function, following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63 introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on. Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to [[Giuseppe Peano]] on their "Contents" page, although this attribution does not seem to be widely credited elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kowwalski|first1=E.|title=Peano paragraphing|url=http://blogs.ethz.ch/kowalski/2008/06/03/peano-paragraphing/|website=blogs.ethz.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section breaks ==

{{main|Section (typography)}}

Many published books use a device to separate certain paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may contain an [[asterisk]], three asterisks, a special stylistic [[dingbat]], or a special symbol known as an [[asterism (typography)|asterism]].

==Purpose and style advice==

A [[List of common English usage misconceptions#Usage|common English usage misconception]] is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.&lt;ref name="UNC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/|title=Paragraph Development|author=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|first=|date=|work=The Writing Center|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate.  Forms generally vary among types of writing.  For example, newspapers, scientific journals, and fictional essays have somewhat different conventions for the placement of paragraph breaks.

English students are sometimes taught that a paragraph should have a [[topic sentence]] or "main idea", preferably first, and multiple "supporting" or "detail" sentences which explain or supply evidence.  One technique of this type, intended for essay writing, is known as the [[Schaffer paragraph]].  For example, the following excerpt from [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Lives of the English Poets'', the first sentence is the main idea: that [[Joseph Addison]] is a skilled "describer of life and manners". The succeeding sentences are details that support and explain the main idea in a specific way.



This advice differs from stock advice for the construction of paragraphs in Japanese (translated as ''danraku'' 段落).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalt.org/pansig/2004/HTML/KimKon.htm|title=Effective writing instruction: From Japanese danraku to English paragraphs|first=Kazumi Kimura and Masako Kondo (timkondo *AT* nifty . com / Kazumikmr *AT* aol .|last=com)|date=|website=jalt.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pariṇāma-vāda''' ({{lang-sa|परिणामवाद}}), or theTransformation theory is that which pre-supposes the cause to be continually transforming itself into its effects, and it has three variations – the Satkarya-vada of the [[Samkhya]]s, the Prakrti Parinama-vada of the [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and the Brahma-Parinama-vada of the [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] School of Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In Indian philosophy, there are basically three major cosmological theories of origination – 1) Arambha-vada (the theory of atomic agglomeration, based on the theory of Asatkarya-vada that the effect, which is something newly produced, does not exist in the cause), 2) Parinama-vada (the theory of real transformation, based on satkarya-vada that the effect, though phenomenally different, is substantially identical with the cause, and pre-exists latently in it), and 3) [[Vivartavada]] (the theory of apparent transformation or of false appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Thousand Teachings: Upadesasahasari of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=SUNY Press|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fkLggRFFBwC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpvPUsnUO8Sq7QaCnYDADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the fourth, [[Pratityasamutpada|Pratityasamutpada-vada]], the theory of dependent origination of [[Buddhism]].

According to the Sat-Karya-vada of the Samkhya School of [[Vedanta]], also accepted by the [[Vishishtadvaita|Vishishtadvaitavada Vedanta]], causation is the manifestation of what is in the latent condition in the cause. The Prakrti Parnama-vada is based on the premise that the world is a transformation of the primordial Nature or [[Prakrti]]. According to the Brahman Parinama-vada, the world is a transformation of [[Brahman]].
Parināma-vāda is the term that refers to the [[Monotheism|Monotheistic Schools]]’ theory of ‘actual transformation’ different from [[Vivartavada]], the [[Monism|Monistic Schools]]’ theory of apparent transformation. It is the theory that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. According to the Brahman-parinama, this universe is a real transformation of Brahman.

==Arambha-vada==

The Arambha-vada theory of causation is advocated by the [[Nyaya|Nyaya School]], which is the creationistic view of causation and implies new creation as the effect that puts an end to its antecedent nonexistence and marks a new beginning. According to this school the effect, being the counter-entity of its prior nonexistence, must be held to be nonexistent before its appearance as an effect although it arose out of a previously existent cause. This theory is the reverse of Parinama-vada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sadhu Santideva|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Arambhavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahman as the cause==

The general Vedanta view is that Brahman is both, the Material and the Efficient, cause of the entire universe. There is nothing outside the Omnipresent Brahman. Brahman is the only being which contains the elements of cit and a-cit which are transformed into the forms of individual souls and material objects. There is no external world of souls and matter produced out of external material causes, and the very concept of [[Pradhana]] or Primal Matter, outside Brahman, involves contradiction.

==Sat-Karya-vada==

According to this philosophy, which follows from [[Satkaryavada|Sat-Karya-vada]], the cause first, potentially contains the effect in it as its [[Shakti]] (power), in an un-manifest way; then through the instrumentality of the efficient cause, that potential, latent, un-manifest effect is made actual, patent and manifest. Creation is not a new beginning but the manifestation of the already present un-manifest. The world, as the effect arisen from the pure cause, cannot be impure and imperfect because Brahman, the pure essence, merely transforms itself and does not change, and therefore, remains the same always, whereas the effects are mere names, due to words, for knowing and identifying the effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srikanth’s Philosophy of the Monotheistic Vedanta|author=Ruma Chaudhury|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvwyXwxelxIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prakrti]] is orderly. The [[Ṛta]] (order) that makes Prakrti appear to be composed of sub-systems arranged hierarchically with each sub-system being progressively inclusive, co-ordinating and interdependent is traditionally held to be the main basis of the doctrine of pre-existent effect or Sat-Karya-vada or the doctrine of real transformation or Parinama-vada, which R.A.Sinari states is “the earliest and epistemologically the most valuable attempt made in [[Indian Philosophy]] to set up a theory of causal order”. All phenomena, belonging to the surface and/or the deeper structure of Prakrti, are parinama i.e. transformation, of one and the same substratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Classical Yoga|author=Georg Feuerstein|publisher=Inner Traditions|pages=30–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWI9M9WC6MC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZWLPUsefGsOThQfsxoGQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] says: मायां तु प्रकृतिं – “Know Maya to be Prakrti”. But, both the Samkhya School and the [[Brahma Sutra]]s base their understandings of the process of transformation for origination of things on the will of the creator. Badarayana by stating – नासतोऽदृष्टत्वात् | (Brahma Sutra 2.2.26), declares that Existence does not come out of non-existence. The entire creation is the result of Brahman’s will – अभिध्योपदेशाच्च | (Brahma Sutra 1.4.24), and that all transmigratory existence has no beginning - उपपद्यते चाप्युलभ्यते च | (Brahma Sutra 2.1.36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=414, 294, 364|url=http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/brahma-sutra-bhasya-of-shankaracharya-IDJ504/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra view==

[[Tantra]] has influenced the [[Hindu]], the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and the [[Jainism|Jain]] traditions. According to the Srividya and the Saivite texts, the thirty-six tattvas covering the entire range of the un-manifest and manifest world, from the gross to the most subtle known as siva, pure illumination. Parinama-vada called Sakti parinama-vada, along with the doctrine of [[Abhasavada]] or [[Pratibimbavada]], explains the relationship between samvit or Tripura and the world; Tripura refers to the totality of the three-folds – sthula (gross), suksma (subtle) and para (transcendent), it represents. According to Abhasa-vada, samvit is like a mirror and the universe is a reflection appearing on it. But the universe cannot be outside the mirror i.e. citi or samvit. According to Parinama-vada, citi (consciousness) manifests in the form of the universe without losing its pristine nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sakti – The Power in Tantra|author=Rajmani Tigunait|publisher=Himalayan Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XnnFl6ZFHwC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Parinama-vada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWHPUoC7IMyThQe6woGgCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Parinama-vada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vivartavada==

[[Gaudapada]] treats creation as an imaginary event even though it seems to follow a sequential order. [[Badarayana]] also states that creation for Brahman is a mere pastime out of his spontaneity without any extraneous motive. But, Gaudapada, who was aware of the concepts of the real and apparent transformations, develops the doctrine of creation as an illusory transformation of Brahman without recourse to ‘vivarta’ terminology. The followers of Advaita School promoted by [[Adi Sankara]], to whom owing to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] the world appears as if it is real i.e. distortion or false apprehension of the all encompassing unity of Brahman, use this term ‘vivarta’ to support the principle of the immutability of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of Gaudapadiya|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4aTPUvnHMYqBhAfXsoG4Aw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vidyaranya]] reminds us – एकमेवाद्वितीयं सन्नामरूपविवर्जितम् | - that before the creation there existed the Reality, one only, without a second, and without name and form ([[Panchadasi]] 5.5), this after explaining (in verse 2.59) that with Brahman as its basis, Maya creates the various objects of the world, just as a variety of pictures are drawn on a wall by the use of different colours, in other words, “Maya makes it possible for the imagination to attribute different changes to the unchangeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|author=Swami Swahananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=59,124|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pancadasi-Swami-Vidyaranya/dp/8171205070}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is, therefore, said that “Maya resembles [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]], the source of common illusions, and described as the principle of cosmic illusion, thus differing from Prakrti of the Samkhyas which is real in the full sense of the term”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt. Ltd.|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uKXPUqz3DJSqhQedzYHYAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Both, Parnama-vada and Vivartavada, have their own critics. [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhava]] rejects [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] on the ground that it is not possible for Brahman to transform at the loss of original nature, and there cannot exist unbridgeable gulf between Cit (Spirit) and Jada (Matter).239 A perfect being of pure intelligence and bliss cannot evolve out of itself an effect that is inert and wholly lacking in intelligence. [[Ramanuja]] accepts the material causality of Brahman which is absolutely without personal modification and which has the transforming Prakrti as its body. Vivarta concept is rejected because Brahman is not the constituent cause of Maya, therefore Brahman cannot be the constituent cause of the world through Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras|author=Garma C.C.Chanpage=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=parinamavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x6bPUtvnJ46ihgfY1oCYDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=parinamavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Phonological Awareness for Literacy''' (PAL) Program (Burrows, Allison, Barnett, and Savina, 2007) is a commercial literacy therapy program for use by [[speech therapist]]s designed to improve  [[phonological awareness]] skills required for [[literacy]] in children aged 8 – 12. It aims to create/strengthen awareness of the relationship between phonological awareness skills to reading and writing.

== Theoretical foundations ==
Adapted from Auditory Discrimination in Depth (Lindamood &amp; Lindamood, 1975), which is now known as the [[Lindamood Phoneme Sequencing (LiPS) Program]].

== Intervention description ==
The PAL introduces identification, segmentation, blending and manipulation of speech sounds in syllables. It does not encourage reading using the whole-word approach instead teaching children to break written words up into individual [[grapheme]]s and matching letters with their corresponding [[phoneme]]s before reassembling the phonemes back into words to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brady|first1=Susan|last2=Shankweiler|first2=Donald|title=Phonological Processes in Literacy: A Tribute to Isabelle Y. Liberman|date=Sep 13, 2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key skills taught ===

'''Developing an awareness of linguistic terms:''' Checks child's understanding of literacy terminology used and teaches the child how to talk about language ([[metalinguistic]] skills).

'''Sound–symbol association:''' Determines child's knowledge of how letters and sounds correspond, and that can be several representations of each sound.

'''Block representation of Consonant or vowel sequences:''' This component facilitates the child's ability to segment words into individual phonemes through developing auditory analysis skills. A single block represents an individual sound, and a row of blocks represent a string of sounds; so that the number of blocks directly correlates to the number of sounds in the sequence.

'''Block representation of syllables:''' Once the child understands that syllables consist of sounds, they then have to count the number of sounds, the order and distinguish between phonetic features. N.B. all block representation tasks deal only with non-words; this is to prevent the child from using pre-learned spelling patterns to respond to the tasks.

'''Reading and spelling non-words:''' This builds on previously learnt skills by using block representation to read and spell non-words. The child is encouraged to employ metalinguistic knowledge to describe changes.

'''Reading and spelling real words:''' Children learn to transfer the aforementioned foundation skills to simple/regular real words, which do not require specific spelling rules.

=== Components of therapy ===

simple words

complex words

multisyllabic words

Each level consists of subsections of teaching, auditory analysis, decoding and encoding. Children progress from non-words to real words within each level, prior to commencing the next level. The design of the program ensures that the child is not exposed to more difficult tasks before acquiring the necessary skills at preceding levels.

'''Level 1''' (simple words): Simple syllables with structures up to a [[consonant]]–[[vowel]]–consonant (CVC) level. The focus of this level is the ability to decode and encode CVC syllables, before applying this skill in reading and spelling. This incorporates the learning of long and short vowels in addition to consonants. Words used at this level have consistent grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs).

'''Level 2''' (complex words): Consonant clusters are introduced, in addition to application of specific rules (e.g. borrower c and g, and Magic E).

'''Level 3''' (multisyllabic words): Specific teaching on how to break words up into syllables and the introduction of grammatical morphemes. This level builds on the previously learned abilities of segmenting and manipulating sounds by transferring these skills to syllables within multisyllabic words.

== Materials/Training Required ==

The manual
Coloured blocks, letter tiles
Record sheets and file/folder
Suitable reinforcement (stickers, stamps etc.)

Therapy should be delivered by a suitably qualified [[speech therapist]].

== Alternative/Similar Interventions ==
Reading Freedom Remedial Reading Program (Calder, 1992)

Sounds Abound. Listening, Rhyming &amp; Reading (Catts, 1993)

Auditory Discrimination in Depth (Lindamood and Lindamood, 1975)

'''''Rhema''''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an "utterance" or "thing said" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 {{ISBN|1-4051-0252-7}} page 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 {{ISBN|0-521-09666-9}} page 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to [[proposition]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"/&gt;

In [[Christianity]], it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] "saying, utterance, word, verb" is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) "say" (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] "I say"; ἐρῶ "I will say") and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

==Greek philosophers==
&lt;small&gt;
{| align="right" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
| LOGIC || ARISTOTLE || GRAMMAR
|-
| subject || onoma || noun
|-
| predicate || rhema || verb
|-
| proposition || logos || sentence 
|-
|}&lt;/small&gt;

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a [[logos]] (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} page 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as ''subject'' and ''predicate''.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} page 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Septuagint usage==
The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} page 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Rhema (doctrine)}}
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] to signify Jesus Christ's utterances.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes ''rhema'' from ''logos'' in [[Christian theology]], with ''rhema'' at times called "spoken word",&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; referring to the revelation received by disciples when the  [[Holy Spirit]] "speaks" to them.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 {{ISBN|0-8054-2692-2}} page 162 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-294-3}} page [https://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, "Logos" refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G.

In [[logic]], the '''semantics of logic''' is the study of the [[semantics]], or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s, of [[formal language|formal]] and (idealizations of) [[natural language]]s usually trying to capture the pre-theoretic notion of [[logical consequence|entailment]].

==Overview==
The truth conditions of various sentences we may encounter in [[argument]]s will depend upon their meaning, and so logicians cannot completely avoid the need to provide some treatment of the meaning of these sentences.  The semantics of logic refers to the approaches that logicians have introduced to understand and determine that part of meaning in which they are interested; the logician traditionally is not interested in the sentence as uttered but in the [[proposition]], an idealised sentence suitable for logical manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Until the advent of modern logic, [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'', especially ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', provided the basis for understanding the significance of logic.  The introduction of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that governed Aristotle's account, although there is a renewed interest in [[term logic]], attempting to find calculi in the spirit of Aristotle's syllogistic but with the generality of modern logics based on the quantifier.

The main modern approaches to semantics for formal languages are the following:
* '''Model-theoretic semantics''' is the archetype of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]], based on his [[T-schema]], and is one of the founding concepts of [[model theory]].  This is the most widespread approach, and is based on the idea that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined mathematical domains: an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics provides the foundations for an approach to the theory of meaning known as [[Truth-conditional semantics]], which was pioneered by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].  [[Kripke semantics]] introduces innovations, but is broadly in the Tarskian mold.
* '''[[Proof-theoretic semantics]]''' associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences. [[Gerhard Gentzen]], [[Dag Prawitz]] and [[Michael Dummett]] are generally seen as the founders of this approach; it is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".
* '''[[Truth-value semantics]]''' (also commonly referred to as ''substitutional quantification'') was advocated by [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] for modal logics in the early 1960s and later championed by Dunn, Belnap, and Leblanc for standard first-order logic. [[James Garson]] has given some results in the areas of adequacy for [[intensional logic]]s outfitted with such a semantics. The truth conditions for quantified formulas are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains whatsoever (and hence its name ''truth-value semantics'').
* '''[[Game semantics|Game-theoretical semantics]]''' has made a resurgence lately mainly due to [[Jaakko Hintikka]] for logics of (finite) partially ordered quantification which were originally investigated by [[Leon Henkin]], who studied [[Henkin quantifier]]s.
* '''[[Probabilistic semantics]]''' originated from H. Field and has been shown equivalent to and a natural generalization of truth-value semantics. Like truth-value semantics, it is also non-referential in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12368">The [[Serbian language]] is one of the officially recognized minority languages in [[Croatia]]. It is primarily used by the [[Serbs of Croatia]]. The [[Croatian Constitution]], [[Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights]], [[Law on Education in language and script of national minorities]] and [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] define the public co-official usage of Serbian in Croatia. Serbian and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] are two [[standard language|standardized]] [[Variety (linguistics)#Standard varieties|varieties]] of the [[Pluricentric language|pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language]]. Majority of Serbs of Croatia use [[Ijekavian]] pronunciation of [[Proto-Slavic]] vowel [[Yat|jat]] except in the [[Podunavlje]] region in [[Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja]] Counties where local Serb population use [[Ekavian]] pronunciation. Post-[[World War II]] and [[Croatian War of Independence]] settlers in Podunavlje which have come from [[Bosnia]], [[Dalmatia]] or Western Slavonia either use their original Ijekavian pronunciation, adopted Ekavian pronunciation or both of them depending on context. In 2011 Census majority of Serbs of Croatia declared Croatian standardized variety as their first language with Ijekavian pronunciation always being required standard form in Croatian. While Serbian variety recognizes both pronunciations as standard Ekavian is the more common one as it is the dominant one in [[Serbia]], with Ijekavian being mostly limited to [[Republika Srpska]] in Bosnia, [[Montenegro]] and Croatia.

==History==
The Orthodox [[liturgical book]] [[Varaždin Apostol]] from 1454 represents the oldest preserved text in [[Cyrillic]] from the territory of today's Croatia.&lt;ref name="biskupija"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biskupija-varazdinska.hr/OLD/Aktualno/Aktualnosti_2005/Aktualno823.htm |title=A823 |publisher=Biskupija-varazdinska.hr |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights, one of only two constitutional laws in country, entered into force on 23 December 2002.&lt;ref name="SDF-May 2007."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdf.hr/publikacije/provedba_UZPNM_na_lokalnom_nivou.pdf |title=Provedba Ustavnog zakona o pravima nacionalnih manjina u jedinicama lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|accessdate=3 May 2014 |author=[[Serb Democratic Forum]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serbian language education==
[[File:Škola u Trpinji.jpg|thumbnail|right|bi-lingual plate in front of the school in [[Trpinja]]]]
[[File:Dalj_Street_sign.JPG|thumbnail|right|Bilingual street sign in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] in [[Dalj]], eastern [[Croatia]]]]
Most schools with instruction in Serbian are located in [[Vukovar-Srijem County|Vukovar-Srijem]] and [[Osijek-Baranja County]] in the area of former [[Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995–98)|Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia]] where rights on education in minority languages were provided during the [[United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium]] based on the  [[Erdut Agreement]]. Today with those schools there is also [[Kantakuzina Katarina Branković Serbian Orthodox Secondary School]] in [[Zagreb]].

In the school year 2010-2011, 3.742 students attended kindergartens, primary and secondary schools in Serbian.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/PeriodicalReports/CroatiaPR5_hr.pdf | title=Peto izvješće Republike Hrvatske o primjeni Europske povelje o regionalnim ili manjinskim jezicima | date=October 2013 | author=Government of Croatia | publisher=[[Council of Europe]] | page=36 | language=hr | format=PDF | accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59 educational institutions offered Serbian language education that year and 561 educators and teachers worked in them.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt; In school year 2011-2012 the total number of students was 4.059 in 63 educational institutions and 563 educators and teachers worked in them.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt; Number of classes or groups in this period increased from 322 to 353.&lt;ref name="Prijedlog izvještaja" /&gt;

As a chair at the Department of [[South Slavic languages]], [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] at the [[University of Zagreb]] has a The Chair of [[Serbian literature|Serbian]] and [[Montenegrin literature]].&lt;ref name="Filozofski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/slaven/juzslav/en/about-the-department/the-chair-of-serbian-and-montenegrin-literature/ | title=The Chair of Serbian and Montenegrin Literature | date= | author=[[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] | publisher=[[University of Zagreb]] | page= | language=en | format= | accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the others, lecturers of Serbian literature at the university over the time included [[Antun Barac]], [[Đuro Šurmin]] and [[Armin Pavić]].&lt;ref name="Filozofski"/&gt;

==Other forms of cultural autonomy==
Various minority organizations use Serbian in their work. One of them, [[Association for Serbian language and literature in Croatia]] from [[Vukovar]] is a nonprofit professional organization that brings together scientists and technical workers in the Republic of Croatia engaged in studying and teaching of Serbian language and literature.

==The co-official use at local government level==
The [[Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities]] provides for a mandatory co-official use of minority languages in [[municipalities of Croatia]] with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy. Municipalities [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]], [[Gvozd]], [[Jagodnjak]], [[Šodolovci]], [[Borovo, Croatia|Borovo]], [[Trpinja]], [[Markušica]], [[Negoslavci]], [[Biskupija]], [[Ervenik]], [[Kistanje]], [[Gračac]], [[Udbina]], [[Vrbovsko]], [[Donji Kukuruzari]], [[Erdut]] and [[Vukovar]], according to the provisions of law, are obliged to grant equal co-official use of Serbian language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Law enforcement is facing great resistance in the part of the majority population, most notably in the case of Vukovar where it led to [[2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2439">A '''singular term''' is a paradigmatic referring device in a language. Singular terms are of philosophical importance for [[philosophy of language|philosophers of language]], because they ''refer'' to things in the world, and the ability of words to refer calls for scrutiny.

==Overview==
Singular terms are defined as expressions that purport to denote or designate particular individual people, places, or other objects. They contrast with ''general terms'' (such as "car" or "chair") which can apply to more than one thing.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lycan]], ''Philosophy of Language'', 2nd edition, Routledge, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are various kinds of singular terms: proper names (eg. "Matthew"), definite descriptions (eg. "the second fisherman in the boat"), singular personal pronouns (eg. "she"), demonstrative pronouns (eg. "this"), etc.

Historically, various definitions for "singular term" have been offered:

# A term that tells us which individual is being talked about. ([[John Stuart Mill]], [[Arthur Prior]], [[P. F. Strawson]]) &lt;ref&gt;Strawson 1950, Prior 1976, Mill 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is grammatically singular, i.e. a [[proper name]] (''proprium nomen''), a [[demonstrative pronoun]] (''pronomen demonstrativum'') or a demonstrative pronoun with a common name (''cum termino communi''). ([[William of Ockham]])&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Summa Logicae''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is inherently ''about'' the object to which it applies or [[Reference|refers]]. ([[Gottlob Frege]]) &lt;ref&gt;Frege 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
# A term that is true "in the same sense" of only one object. ([[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]])&lt;ref&gt;Peter of Spain 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''umbrella term''' is a word or phrase that covers a wide range of concepts belonging to a common [[Categorization|category]]. For example, ''[[cryptology]]'' is an umbrella term that encompasses [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]], among other fields. Similarly, an [[umbrella organization]] is a central and coordinating body representing a number of smaller, separate bodies.

A '''blanket term''' is a closely related [[morpheme|word]] or [[phrase]] that is used to describe multiple groups of related things. The degree of relation may vary or have a minimal relationship, but blanket terms often trade specificity for ease of use. In other words, a blanket term, by itself, gives little detail about the things that it describes or the relationships between them, but it is easy to say and remember. Blanket terms may originate as [[slang]] but eventually become integrated into the general vocabulary.

{{Orphan|date=October 2015}}

In [[linguistics]], the term "'''universal grinder'''" refers to an idea that in some languages, most [[count noun]]s can be used as if they were [[mass noun]]s, which causes a slight change in their meaning. The term "universal grinder" was first used in print by F. Jeffry Pelletier in 1975, after a personal suggestion by David Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, F. Jeffry: ''Non-singular reference: some preliminaries''. In ''Philosophia'' Vol. 5 No. 4 Pp. 451–465, October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related concepts, the '''universal sorter''' and '''universal packager''' refer to similar processes that allow mass nouns to be used as count nouns.

==Universal grinder==
The idea of the "universal grinder" is that while count nouns usually denote whole, distinct objects (such as ''a steak'', ''two steaks''), the equivalent mass noun connotes a non-distinct quantity of whatever constitutes these objects (''some steak''). The universal grinder suggests that most count nouns can be used as mass nouns, and the distinct thing named by the noun will be thought of as a general quantity.

While the "universal grinder" can be used in many [[Indo-European language]]s, most particularly [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], it does not apply in all languages; there is considerable cross-linguistic variation in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and semantics of the mass/count and singular/plural distinctions. For example, bare count nouns in [[Mandarin Chinese]] do not receive mass interpretations: a sentence such as ''Qiáng-shang dōu shì gǒu'' can only be interpreted as 'There are dogs all over the wall,' not as 'There is dog all over the wall.'&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Lisa L.S., Doetjes, Jenny, and Sybesma, Rint: ''How universal is the Universal Grinder?'' In ''Linguistics in the Netherlands 2008'', pp. 50–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal sorter and packager==
The "universal sorter" describes one way in which mass nouns are understood when they are used in the [[plural]]. Harry Bunt suggested the universal sorter in his 1981 doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Bunt|first=Hendrik C. |year=1981|title=The formal semantics of mass terms|publisher=Universiteit van Amsterdam|oclc=251587734}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an ordinarily uncountable noun such as ''wine'' appears with plural form (''several wines''), it can be understood as referring to various abstract kinds (for example, varieties of wine).&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zhang|first=Niina Ning|title=Classifier Structures in Mandarin Chinese|year=2013|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-030499-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "universal packager" likewise describes how mass nouns are understood when they are used as countable nouns. In this case, the plural noun may be understood as naming individual servings or "packages" (e.g. ''two coffees'' may mean "two cups of coffee"), or as naming abstract kinds (''two coffees'' can also refer to e.g. [[Colombian coffee]] and [[Indonesian coffee]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filip|first=Hana |title=Aspect, Eventuality Types, and Nominal Reference|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8153-3271-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars use the phrase ''universal packager'' to refer to both the concrete and abstract understanding of plural nouns; others use it to refer only to the concrete sense, and use ''universal sorter'' for abstract meaning.&lt;ref name="Zhang" /&gt;

[[File:Utterance.png|thumb|Utterance being spoken]]
[[File:Two-people-talking-logo.jpg|thumb|A black and white icon of two people talking to indicate discussion with one another]]

In [[spoken language]] analysis, an '''utterance''' is the smallest unit of [[speech communication|speech]]. It is a continuous piece of speech beginning and ending with a clear pause. In the case of [[oral language]]s, it is generally but not always bounded by silence. Utterances do not exist in written language, only their representations do. They can be represented and delineated in [[written language]] in many ways.

In oral/spoken language utterances have several features including paralinguistic features which are aspects of speech such as [[facial expression]], [[gesture]], and posture. Prosodic features include stress, intonation, and tone of voice, as well as [[ellipsis]], which are words that the listener inserts in spoken language to fill gaps. Moreover, other aspects of utterances found in spoken languages are non-fluency features including: voiced/un-voiced pauses (like "umm"), tag questions, and false starts when someone begins their utterances again to correct themselves. Other features include: fillers ("and stuff"); accent/dialect; deictic expressions, which are utterances like "over there!" which need further explanation to be understood; simple conjunctions ("and," "but," etc.); and colloquial lexis which are everyday informal words.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allinfo.org.uk/levelup/enb1.htm|title=Level Up: English Language|website=www.allinfo.org.uk|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utterances that are portrayed in writing are planned, in contrast to utterances in improvised spoken language. In written language there are frameworks that are used to portray this type of language. Discourse structure (which can also be found in spoken language) is how the conversation is organized, in which [[adjacency pairs]] - an utterance and the answer to that utterance - are used. [[Discourse marker]]s are used to organize conversation ("first," "secondly," etc.). [[Lexis (linguistics)|Lexis]] denotes the words being used in a text or spoken; these words can create a [[semantic field]]. For example, a semantic field of love can be created with lexical choices such as adore, admire, and care. Grammar/syntax is another feature of language in general but also utterances, and [[pragmatics]] means that when utterances are spoken or written the meaning is not literal, as in sarcasm.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

== Characteristics/features ==
An utterance which is found in spoken and [[written language]] as in a [[Screenplay|script]] has several characteristics. These include paralinguistic features which is a feature of communication that doesn't involve words but is added around an utterance to give meaning. Examples of paralinguistic features include facial expressions, laughter, eye contact, and gestures. [[Prosodic]] features refer to the sound of someone's voice as they speak: pitch, [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and stress. Ellipsis can be used in either written or spoken language, when an utterance is conveyed and the speaker omits words because they are already understood in the situation. For example: A: Juice? B: Please. A: Room temperature? B: Cold.

Non-fluency features also occur when producing utterances. As people think about what to say to while speaking, there are errors and corrections in speech. For example, voiced/un-voiced pauses which are "umm," "erm," etc. in voiced pauses and in transcripts un-voiced pauses are denoted as (.) or (1) relating to the amount of time of the pause. [[Tag question]]s are also a part of non-fluency features; these are used by the speaker to check if the listener understands what the speaker is saying. An example is "Do you know what I mean?" False alerts occur when the speaker is voicing an utterance but stops and starts again, usually to correct themselves.

[[Filler (linguistics)|Fillers]] usually give the speaker time to think and gather their thoughts in order to continue their utterance; these include lexis such as, "like," "and stuff,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Candea|first=Maria|year=2005|title=Inter- and intra-language acoustic analysis of autonomous fillers|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00321914/document|journal=Hal|volume=|pages=47–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accent/dialect is also a characteristic included in utterances which is the way the words are voiced, the pronunciation and the different types of lexis used in different parts of the world. [[Deictic expression]]s are utterances that need more explanation in order to be understood, like: "Wow! Look over there!" Simple conjunctions in speech are words that connect other words like "and," "but," etc. Colloquial lexis is a type of speech that is casual in which the utterance is usually more relaxed.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The development of utterances in children is facilitated by parents, adults, or any other guardian the child has growing up. Studies have indicated that this development of utterances is affected by the parent, adult, or guardian's [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). It has been shown that children have larger vocabularies and learn new words more quickly during early childhood from parents with a high education and higher SES status, while children with less educated parents and lower SES status have a smaller vocabulary and a slower growth in their [[vocabulary]] skills (Arriaga, Fenson, Cronan &amp; Pethick, 1998; Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, Laursen &amp; Tardif, 2002; Hoff-Ginsberg, 1991; Lawrence &amp; Shipley, 1996; Ninio, 1980){{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This correlation is due to the fact that more educated parents use more lexis when speaking to their children as opposed to parents that are less educated (Hart &amp; Risley, 1995; Hoff, 2003 a; Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea &amp; Hedges, in press){{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Hoff conducted an analysis that shows support for this correlation in 2003 which shows that the mean length of utterance and vocabulary of mothers who talk to their children is related to their SES status and thus child vocabulary development. High-SES mothers use longer utterances when talking to their children and a wider variety of words. They also spend more time talking to their children. Low-SES mothers use shorter utterances and a smaller vocabulary. As a result, children with more educated parents have larger vocabularies (Hoff, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Meredith|title=Child-directed speech: relation to socioeconomic status, knowledge of child development and child vocabulary skill|url=https://www.education.umd.edu/HDQM/labs/Rowe/LDPL/Publications_files/Rowe_JCL_2008.pdf|journal=Cambridge University Press|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In child-directed speech, utterances have several additional features. For example, the [[phonology]] in child-directed speech is different: Utterances are spoken more slowly, with longer pauses in between utterances, higher pitches, etc. The lexis and semantics differ, and a speaker uses words suited for children, "doggie" instead of "dog," for example. The grammar is simpler, repetitive, with less use of verbs and adjectives. There is a greater use of one word utterances and the [[pragmatics]] uses supportive language like expansions and re-casting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revisionworld.com/a2-level-level-revision/english-language/child-language-acquisition/child-directed-speech|title=Child Directed Speech {{!}} a2-level-level-revision, english-language, child-language-acquisition, child-directed-speech {{!}} Revision World|website=revisionworld.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gricean maxims ==
Paul Grice (1989) came up with four maxims necessary in order to have a collegial conversation in which utterances are understood:

#'''Maxim of Quantity''': provide the right amount of information needed for that conversation
#'''Maxim of Quality''': provide information that is true
#'''Maxim of Relation''': provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand
#'''Maxim of Manner''': give order to your utterances throughout conversation, be clear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mako |first=Okanda |year=2015 |title=Understanding violations of Gricean maxims in preschoolers and adults |pmc=4488609 |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=6 |page= 901|via=Frontiers Media SA |pmid=26191018 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Spector |year=2013 |title=Maxims of Conversation |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0129.xml#obo-9780199772810-0129-div1-0005 |journal=Oxford Bibliographies |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bakhtin's theory of utterance==
According to philosopher  [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], there are four accepted properties that utterances should have:
* '''Boundaries''' – All utterances must be bounded by a "change of speech subject". This usually means, as previously mentioned, that they are bounded      by silence.
* '''Responsivity or dialogicity''' – The utterance must be either responding/following a previous utterance or generating dialogue.
* '''Finalization''' – An utterance must have a clear ending, and only occurs if the speaker has said everything he or she wishes to say.
* '''Generic form''' – The choice of the speech genre is determined based on the specific circumstances and sphere in which the dialogue occurs.

Bakhtin also emphasizes that an utterance and a sentence are not the same thing. According to Bakhtin, sentences do not indicate a change of speech subject, and thus do not automatically satisfy one of the four properties of utterances. According to him, the sentence as a language unit is grammatical in nature, while an utterance is "ethical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~jds/Bakhtin%20utterance.htm Utterance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vocabulary development''' is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.

In order to build their vocabularies, infants must learn about the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] that words carry. The mapping problem asks how infants correctly learn to attach words to [[referent]]s. Constraints theories, [[Domain-general learning|domain-general]] views, social-[[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] accounts, and an [[Emergentism|emergentist]] coalition model have been proposed to account for the mapping problem...

From an early age, infants use language to [[Communication|communicate]]. [[Caregiver]]s and other family members use language to teach children how to act in society. In their interactions with peers, children have the opportunity to learn about unique conversational roles. Through pragmatic directions, adults often offer children cues for understanding the meaning of words.

Throughout their school years, children continue to build their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading. Word learning often involves physical context, builds on prior knowledge, takes place in social context, and includes semantic support. The [[phonological loop]] and [[Serial-order learning|serial order]] short-term memory may both play an important role in vocabulary development.

[[File:Az girl reading a book. e-citizen.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Reading is an important means through which children develop their vocabulary.]]

==Early word learning==
Infants begin to understand words such as "Mommy", "Daddy", "hands" and "feet" when they are approximately 6 months old.{{sfn|Tincoff|Jusczyk|1999}}{{sfn|Tincoff|Jusczyk,2012}} Initially, these words refer to their own mother or father or hands or feet. Infants begin to produce their first words when they are approximately one year old.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} Infants' first words are normally used in reference to things that are of importance to them, such as objects, body parts, people, and relevant actions. Also, the first words that infants produce are mostly single-syllabic or repeated single [[syllables]], such as "no" and "dada".{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} By 12 to 18 months of age, children's vocabularies often contain words such as "kitty", "bottle", "doll", "car" and "eye". Children's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships. "One" and "two" are the first number words that children learn between the ages of one and two.{{sfn|Barner|Zapf|Lui|2012}} Infants must be able to hear and play with sounds in their environment, and to break up various phonetic units to discover words and their related meanings.

===Phonological development===
{{main|Phonological development}}
Studies related to vocabulary development show that children's language competence depends upon their ability to hear [[sounds]] during infancy.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}{{sfn|Pinker|1994}}{{sfn|Waxman|Booth|2000}} Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language(s) to which they are exposed.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries.{{sfn|Teinonen|Aslin|Alku|Csibra|2008}} Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}

Children's phonological development normally proceeds as follows:{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}

'''6–8 weeks''': Cooing appears

'''16 weeks''': Laughter and vocal play appear

'''6–9 months''': Reduplicated (canonical) babbling appears

'''12 months''': First words use a limited sound repertoire

'''18 months''': Phonological processes (deformations of target sounds) become systematic

'''18 months–7 years''': Phonological inventory completion

At each stage mentioned above, children play with sounds and learn methods to help them learn words.{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words.{{sfn|Keren-Portnoy|Majorano|Vihman|2009}} Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss as a result of ear infections.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal [[babbling]].

===Babbling===
{{main|Babbling}}
[[Babbling]] is an important aspect of vocabulary development in infants, since it appears to help practice producing speech sounds.{{sfn|Fagan|2009}} Babbling begins between five and seven months of age. At this stage, babies start to play with sounds that are not used to express their emotional or physical states, such as sounds of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} Babies begin to babble in real syllables such as "ba-ba-ba, neh-neh-neh, and dee-dee-dee,"{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} between the ages of seven and eight months; this is known as canonical babbling.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}} Jargon babbling includes strings of such sounds; this type of babbling uses intonation but doesn't convey meaning. The [[phonemes]] and [[syllable|syllabic]] patterns produced by infants begin to be distinctive to particular languages during this period (e.g., increased nasal sounds in French and Japanese babies) though most of their sounds are similar.{{sfn|Hoff|2005}}{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} There is a shift from babbling to the use of words as the infant grows.{{sfn|Vihman|1993}}

===Vocabulary spurt===
As children get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By the age of eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension.{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}}{{sfn|Pinker|1994}} A switch from an early stage of slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth is referred to as the ''vocabulary spurt''.{{sfn|Ganger|Brent|2004}} Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week.{{sfn|Ganger|Brent|2004}} Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as ''no bye-bye'' and ''more please''.{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using ''and''.{{sfn|Hulit|Howard|2002}} This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. In one study of 38 children, only five of the children had an inflection point in their rate of word acquisition as opposed to a quadratic growth.{{sfn|Ganger|Brent|2004}} This study suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.

==Mapping problem==
In word learning, the mapping problem refers to the question of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world.{{sfn|Bloom|2000|p=22}} There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto.{{sfn|Bloom|2000|p=22}} Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.

While [[Domain specificity|domain-specific]] accounts of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings,{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}} [[Domain-general learning|domain-general]] perspectives argue that word learning can be accounted for by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Yet other theorists have proposed social [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} According to some{{who|date=May 2012}} research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still play an important role in this process.{{sfn|Baldwin|1995}}{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=142}} Recently, an [[Emergentism|emergentist]] coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}}

===Theories of constraints===
Theories of [[Word learning biases|word-learning constraints]] argue for biases or default assumptions that guide the infant through the word learning process. Constraints are outside of the infant's control and are believed to help the infant limit their hypotheses about the meaning of words that they encounter daily.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Bloom|2000|p=20}} Constraints can be considered domain-specific (unique to language).

Critics{{who|date=May 2012}} argue that theories of constraints focus on how children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}} Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden because they are not utilized in adult language.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=53}} For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the [[Mutual exclusivity (psychology)|mutual exclusivity]] constraint.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=53}}

Below, the most prominent constraints in the literature are detailed:
* '''[[Reference]]''' is the notion that a word symbolizes or stands in for an object, action, or event.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=139}} Words consistently stand for their [[referent]]s, even if referents are not physically present in context.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=139}}
* '''Mutual Exclusivity''' is the assumption that each object in the world can only be referred to by a single label.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Merriman|Bowman|MacWhinney|1989|p=3}}
* '''Shape''' has been considered to be one of the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=45}} Infants assume that objects that have the same shape also share a name.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=52}} Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and inappropriate extensions.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=45}}
* '''The Whole Object Assumption''' is the belief that labels refer to whole objects instead of parts or properties of those objects.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=50}} Children are believed to hold this assumption because they typically label whole objects first, and parts of properties of objects later in development.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=50}}
* '''The [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] Assumption''' reflects the belief that speakers use words to refer to categories that are internally consistent.{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=52}} Labels to pick out coherent categories of objects, rather than those objects and the things that are related to them.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=284}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=52}} For example, children assume that the word "dog" refers to the category of "dogs", not to "dogs with bones", or "dogs chasing cats".{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=52}}

===Domain-general views===
[[Domain-general learning|Domain-general]] views of vocabulary development argue that children do not need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as [[Salience (language)|salience]], association, and frequency.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most [[Salience (language)|salient]] in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=143}} Additionally, research on word learning suggests that [[fast mapping]], the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}}

Domain-general views have been criticized for not fully explaining how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=144}} For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects?{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=144}} However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}} Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=55}} Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=55}}

===Social pragmatic theories===
Social [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] theories, also in contrast to the constraints view, focus on the [[social context]] in which the infant is embedded.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}} Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=141}}

[[Joint attention]] is an important mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=285}} Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint attention is often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=285}} As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=285}} Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to in the world at the same time.{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}} The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the [[Kaluli people|Kaluli]], a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels in the context of their [[referent]]s.{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}} While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the [[meaning-making]] process, some theorists{{who|date=May 2012}} argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=142}} When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-[[referent]] mappings.{{sfn|Baldwin|1995}}{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}} Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.{{sfn|Sabbagh|Baldwin|2005}}

From early on, children also assume that language is designed for communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}} Specifically, infants observe the principles of [[conventionality]] and [[Contrast (linguistics)|contrast]]. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term that everyone in the community would expect to be used.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=64}} According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}}{{sfn|Clark|1993|p=64}} Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=286}}

===Emergentist coalition model===
The [[Emergentism|emergentist]] coalition model suggests that children make use of multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}} The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues are available from the start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}} While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=145}} Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use of a wide range of cues develops over time.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=146}}

Supporters of the emergentist coalition model argue that, as a hybrid, this model moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning that is not captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=159}} Additionally, some argue{{who|date=May 2012}} that domain-general perspectives do not fully address the question of how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=159}} Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=159}} According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.{{sfn|Hirsh-Pasek|Golinkoff|Hollich|2000|p=160}}

==Pragmatic development==
Both linguistic and socio-cultural factors affect the rate at which vocabulary develops.{{sfn|Tardif|Fletcher|Liang|Kaciroti|2009}} Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=339}} They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others in a wide variety of interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations.{{sfn|Tomasello|2000}} Children rely on [[Pragmatics|pragmatic skills]] to build more extensive vocabularies.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later [[literacy]] and [[mathematical]] achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=352–353}}

Children use words differently for objects, spatial relations and actions. Children ages one to three often rely on general purpose [[Deixis|deictic]] words such as "here", "that" or "look" accompanied by a [[gesture]], which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word ''overextension'' or misuses of words. Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different [[reference|referents]]. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} When children come into contact with [[spatial relations]], they talk about the location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as ''here'' or "there" for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]], [[Preposition and postposition|postposition]] or [[suffix]] depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location.{{sfn|Clark|1978}} Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose [[verb]]s, such as "do" and "make" for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a [[second language]] seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.{{sfn|Clark|1978}}

Infants use words to communicate early in life and their [[communication skills]] develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=342}} Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as ''then'', ''so'', and ''because'' are more frequently used as children get older.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=342–343}} When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=343–345}}

===Pragmatic influences===
[[Caregiver]]s use language to help children become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as [[peekaboo]] to provide children with information about words and [[phrase]]s. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=348}} Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about what children are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, and how they can stay on topic. Caregivers may [[Modelling (psychology)|model]] the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=348–349}}

Family members contribute to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack the capacity to acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=350–351}} There are limitations to studies that focus on the influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is [[descriptive]] and [[correlation]]al. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|p=351}} The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.

[[Peer group|Peers]] help expose children to multi-party conversations. This allows children to hear a greater variety of speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but children may still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.{{sfn|Bryant|2009|pp=352–353}}

Culture and context in infants’ linguistic environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners have been found to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading.{{sfn|Chan et al.|2011}} Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese]] languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.{{sfn|Tardif|Fletcher|Liang|Kaciroti|2009}}

===Pragmatic directions===
Pragmatic directions provide children with additional information about the speaker's intended meaning. Children's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer, such as explicit links to word meanings.{{sfn|Clark|Grossman|1998}} Adults present young children with information about how words are related to each other through connections, such as "is a part of", "is a kind of", "belongs to", or "is used for". These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language, allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words.{{sfn|Clark|Andrew|2002}} This is also called inclusion. When children are provided with two words related by inclusion, they hold on to that information. When children hear an adult say an incorrect word, and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word, children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words.{{sfn|Clark|Grossman|1998}}

==In school-age children==
[[File:US_Navy_081123-N-7862M-001_Students_from_the_Bahrain_School_share_an_interactive_reading_experience_with_U.S._Naval_Support_Activity_Bahrain_Command_Master_Chief_Randy_Shoe_during.jpg|thumb|Children in school share an interactive reading experience.]]
Vocabulary development during the school years builds upon what the child already knows, and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary. Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge, new words are learned through explanations using familiar, or "old" words. This is done either explicitly, when a new word is defined using old words, or implicitly, when the word is set in the context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained.{{sfn|Baker|Simmons|Kameenui|1995}} When children reach school-age, context and implicit learning are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop.{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008|pp=7–8}} By this time, children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=93–110}} Throughout schooling and adulthood, conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops.  This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling, as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development.{{sfn|Baker|Simmons|Kameenui|1995}}{{sfn|Anglin|Miller|2000}}

During the first few years of life, children are mastering [[Concrete noun|concrete words]] such as "car", "bottle", "dog", "cat". By age 3, children are likely able to learn these concrete words without the need for a visual reference, so word learning tends to accelerate around this age.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=103}} Once children reach school-age, they learn [[Abstract object|abstract words]] (e.g. "love", "freedom", "success").{{sfn|Nippold|2004|pp=1–8}} This broadens the vocabulary available for children to learn, which helps to account for the increase in word learning evident at school age.{{sfn|McKeown|Curtis|1987|p=7}} By age 5, children tend to have an expressive vocabulary of 2,100–2,200 words. By age 6, they have approximately 2,600 words of expressive vocabulary and 20,000–24,000 words of receptive vocabulary.{{sfn|Lorraine|2008}} Some claim that children experience a sudden acceleration in word learning, upwards of 20 words per day,{{sfn|Anglin|Miller|2000}} but it tends to be much more gradual than this. From age 6 to 8, the average child in school is learning 6–7 words per day, and from age 8 to 12, approximately 12 words per day.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}}

===Means===
Exposure to [[conversation]]s and engaging in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. [[Fast mapping]] is the process of learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well.{{sfn|Bloom|Markson|1998}} This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] is considered to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children.{{sfn|Baker|Simmons|Kameenui|1995}}{{sfn|Lorraine|2008}}{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008}}{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=97}} Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using [[Context (language use)|context]], as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story.{{sfn|Nagy|Herman|Anderson|1985}} This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=101–103}} Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=101}} When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary.{{sfn|Kamil|Hiebert|2005}} By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.{{sfn|McKeown|Curtis|1987|p=8}}

Generally, both conversation and reading involve at least one of the four principles of context that are used in word learning and vocabulary development: physical context, prior knowledge, social context and semantic support.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=105}}

====Physical context====
Physical context involves the presence of an object or action that is also the topic of conversation. With the use of physical context, the child is exposed to both the words and a visual reference of the word. This is frequently used with infants and toddlers, but can be very beneficial for school-age children, especially when learning rare or infrequently used words.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=97}} Physical context may include props such as in toy play. When engaging in play with an adult, a child's vocabulary is developed through discussion of the toys, such as naming the object (e.g. "dinosaur") or labeling it with the use of a rare word (e.g., ''stegosaurus'').{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=105}} These sorts of interactions expose the child to words they may not otherwise encounter in day-to-day conversation.

====Prior knowledge====
Past experiences or [[general knowledge]] is often called upon in conversation, so it is a useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=105}} For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word ''elephant'', an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word ''elephant'' to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008|pp=xvii}}

====Social context====
[[Social context]] involves pointing out social norms and violations of these norms.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=106}} This form of context is most commonly found in conversation, as opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, "please" and "thank you" are taught to children at a very early age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, "give me the bread" and another responds with, "that was rude. What do you say?", and the person responds with "please", the child may not know the meaning of "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying "please".{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|p=106}}

====Semantic support====
[[Semantics|Semantic]] support is the most obvious method of vocabulary development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information of the meaning of a word.{{sfn|Newton|Padak|Rasinski|2008}}{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=107}} By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra for the first time and ask, ''what is that?'' and the parent might respond, ''that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it''.{{sfn|Tabors|Beals|Weizman|2001|pp=107}}

===Pictures support===
Pictures support involves two memory techniques – association and visualization. Associating an image with a word helps a user learn word in a more effective way. Anshul Agarwal, Founder of dailyvocab.com mentioned in his interview to Career360 – "memory aid for each word help student learn words more faster and effectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.language.careers360.com/articles/dailyvocab-easy-way-learn-english | title=DailyVocab: Easy way to learn English | date=March 11, 2014 | accessdate=August 20, 2016 | author=Nimesh Chandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory===
Memory plays an important role in vocabulary development, however the exact role that it plays is disputed in the literature. Specifically, [[short-term memory]] and how its capacities work with vocabulary development is questioned by many researchers{{who|date=May 2012}}.

The [[phonology]] of words has proven to be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words.{{sfn|Gathercole|Willis|Emslie|Baddeley|1992}} The [[phonological loop]] encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.{{sfn|Gathercole|Willis|Emslie|Baddeley|1992}}

[[Serial-order learning|Serial-order]] short-term memory may be critical to the development of vocabulary.{{sfn|Leclercq|Majerus|2010}} As [[Lexicon|lexical knowledge]] increases, phonological representations have to become more precise to determine the differences between similar sound words (i.e. "calm", "come"). In this theory, the specific order or sequence of phonological events is used to learn new words, rather than phonology as a whole.{{sfn|Leclercq|Majerus|2010}}
