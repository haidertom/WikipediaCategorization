The '''2007 Morocco–Spain diplomatic conflict''' was a short lived disturbance of [[Morocco–Spain relations|international relations between Morocco and Spain]] that arose after the announcement of the impending visit of the [[King of Spain]] to the Spanish-ruled  autonomous cities [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], which are claimed by Morocco.

The dispute formally began when the [[Government of Morocco]] recalled its ambassador to Spain, Omar Azziman. According to a diplomatic note from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco]], "The official announcement on Friday of the unfortunate visit of His Majesty [[King Juan Carlos I]], on 5 and 6 November to the two occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla is a regrettable initiative, whatever are the motives and objectives."&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/expresa/rechazo/viaje/Reyes/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071102elpepinac_16/Tes|title= Marruecos expresa su rechazo al viaje de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco expresses its rejection of the King's trip to Ceuta and Melilla|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elpais2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/llama/consultas/embajador/Espana/elpepuesp/20071102elpepunac_12/Tes|title= Marruecos llama a consultas a su embajador en España|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco calls its ambassador in Spain|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reporting of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,"The ball is in the countryside of Spain and we hope that that country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation."&lt;ref name="elpais2"/&gt;

The royal visit occurred in the days set, registering an influx of thousands of citizens, who cheered the Kings in both Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/301030/0/ceuties/reciben/reyes/|title= Veinticinco mil personas recibieron en Ceuta a Don Juan Carlos y a Doña Sofía|date= November 5, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Twenty thousand people to receive Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in Ceuta|accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=1814_43_574968__Espana-Juan-Carlos-destaca-Melilla-sincera-amistad-vecinos|title= Don Juan Carlos destaca en Melilla "la sincera amistad de España con sus vecinos"|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[La Nueva España]]|location= Melilla|language= Spanish|trans-title=Don Juan Carlos highlighted at Melilla "the sincere friendship of Spain with its neighbors"|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During those days continued statements against the visit were made by the Moroccan authorities. In this regard, the Prime Minister of Morocco, [[Abbas El Fassi]], compared the situation in both cities with the [[Israeli occupation of Palestine|Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories]] and [[King Mohammed VI]] himself described the visit as an "outdated and nostalgic act of a dark era."&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/equipara/Ceuta/Melilla/Palestina/ocupada/Israel/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_5/Tes|title= Marruecos equipara Ceuta y Melilla con la Palestina ocupada por Israel|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco equates Ceuta and Melilla with Israel occupied Palestine|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="condemnation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/condena/visita/real/advierte/Espana/consecuencias/elpepuesp/20071107elpepinac_2/Tes|title= Mohamed VI condena la visita real y advierte a España de las consecuencias|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 7, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI condemned the royal visit of Spain and warned the consequences|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government, just before the visit, and after the reporting of the Moroccan opposition, told through the Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] that the visit of the King of Spain was an act of 'institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Days later, at the initiative of certain groups in Morocco, some hundreds of people carried out protests in [[Tetuan]], as well as front of the border with Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Cientos/personas/reivindican/Tetuan/marroquinidad/Ceuta/Melilla/elpepuesp/20071104elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Cientos de personas reivindican en Tetuán la "marroquinidad" de Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 4, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Hundreds of people claim the "Moroccanness" of Ceuta and Melilla in Tetuan|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccan authority also discontinued high-level visits of Spanish authorities to their country.

Finally, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], visited [[Rabat]] to meet his Moroccan counterpart, [[Taib Fassi Fihri]] on January 3, 2008, and presented him a personal letter from Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to King Mohamed VI, which advocated for closer relations between both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/entrega/Marruecos/carta/Zapatero/dara/pie/vuelta/embajador/elpepuesp/20080103elpepunac_1/Tes|title= Moratinos entrega a Marruecos una carta de Zapatero que dará pie a la vuelta del embajador|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 3, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos delivered letter of Zapatero to Morocco will trigger the return of the ambassador|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry announced the return of its ambassador to Madrid, thus terminating the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/anuncia/regreso/embajador/frio/comunicado/elpepuesp/20080107elpepunac_6/Tes|title= Marruecos anuncia el regreso de su embajador con un frío comunicado|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= January 7, 2008|publisher= [[El País]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco announces the return of its ambassador with a cold statement|accessdate= December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal visit==
[[File:Juan Carlos 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia.]]

On October 30, the [[Government of Spain]] announced the visit of King [[Juan Carlos I]] and Queen [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sofia]] to Ceuta and Melilla from 5 and 6 November. The day before, the Spanish Prime Minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], had told that fact to the opposition leader [[Mariano Rajoy]] during an official ceremony, which Rajoy welcomed.

The King of Spain had not visited Ceuta and Melilla in his reign. The most immediate antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities dates back to 1970, when he undertook a visit to Ceuta in his capacity as [[Prince of Asturias]] on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Spanish Legion]].

The last visit of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla was by king [[Alfonso XIII]], who was last seen in 1927, and President of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], [[Niceto Alcala Zamora]], on 4 November 1933.&lt;ref name="elpais6"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Rey/destaca/visita/Ceuta/cumple/compromiso/pendiente/elpepuesp/20071106elpepinac_3/Tes|title= El Rey destaca que su visita a Ceuta cumple un "compromiso pendiente"|first= Tomás|last= Bárbulo|date= November 6, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King emphasizes that his visit to Ceuta serves a "pending commitment"|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king of Spain was scheduled to visit to the autonomous city of Melilla in 1997 on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/299476/0/visita/oficial/reyes/|title= Los Reyes visitarán por primera vez de forma oficial Ceuta y Melilla|date= October 31, 2007|publisher= [[20 minutos]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=The King will officially visit Ceuta and Melilla for the first time|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, the King and the Queen of Spain stayed in Ceuta for five hours, where they spoke to the [[Assembly of Ceuta|Assembly]] of the Autonomous City, where the monarch said that he "had an pending commitment to Ceuta". Neither the king nor the Minister of Public Administration who accompanied him, [[Elena Salgado]], or any other Spanish authority made any mention of the situation in Morocco.&lt;ref name="elpais6"/&gt; The King was welcomed by 25,000 people.&lt;ref name="kingatceuta"/&gt;

On November 6, the king came to Melilla, in which the Spanish monarch intervened the [[Assembly of Melilla|Assembly]]. There he acknowledged the loyalty of Melillans to the Crown. He made specific reference to Morocco, but said that "Spain through mutual respect cultivates relations of sincere friendship with its neighbors." The number of people who gathered to welcome the King was estimated at 30,000.&lt;ref name="kingatmelilla"/&gt;

==Additional background of the conflict==
A month before the announcement of the royal visit, the judge of the [[National Court of Spain]], [[Baltasar Garzón]], had opened a file to investigate an alleged genocide of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawis]] by Morocco, accepting to process the lawsuit filed in 2006 by various associations defending human rights and relatives of prisoners and disappeared Saharawis, which accused 31 senior officials of Moroccan security. Morocco, meanwhile, was accused of siding with the positions of the [[Polisario Front]]. Moroccan spokesman said that "it would be good that Judge Garzon deal a bit of respect for human rights in Tindouf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lukor.com/not-esp/internacional/0711/01115819.htm|title= Marruecos dice que Garzón debería preocuparse por los DDHH en Tinduf y no por el presunto genocidio saharaui

As stated by [[Yassine Mansouri]], Foreign Secret Service Chief of Morocco, during a stay in [[Mallorca]], the deterioration of relations is also related to the active position of the Spanish Government and local authorities to untie Muslim believers of Ceuta and the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs of Morocco]]; and to bet on movements like the [[Tablig]] (Congregation for the Propagation of Islam) or the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Mansouri informed this to [[Alberto Saiz]], Director of National Intelligence of Spain.

The position was due to the wrath of King Mohamed VI, according to Mansouri, he remembered that Moroccan King is the ''Commander of the Faithful'' and many mosques in Ceuta had been attached to the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] (UCIDE) (36 of 40 Islamic communities of Ceuta). The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, [[Laarbi Maateis]], is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with [[jihadism]]. He also said the prosecution were not understandable "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because it seems to be the best for the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://terranoticias.terra.es/provincias/ceuta/articulo/ceuta_espana_marruecos_2113293.htm|title= Maateis recuerda que el rito musulmán malekita se practica 'en Ceuta, en el resto de España y en Marruecos|date= December 11, 2007|publisher= Terra Actualidad|language= Spanish|trans-title=Maateis recalls that Maliki Muslim rites are practiced in Ceuta, in the rest of Spain and in Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/acusa/Espana/echar/musulmanes/ceuties/brazos/integrismo/elpepuesp/20071210elpepinac_9/Tes|title= Marruecos acusa a España de echar a los musulmanes ceutíes en brazos del integrismo|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 10, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Ceuta|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco accuses Spain to drive the Muslims into the arms of fundamentalist Ceuta|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Moroccan government==
[[File:Mohammed VI of Morocco.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mohamed VI.]]

The [[Prime Minister of Morocco]], [[Abbas El Fassi]], reported the Moroccan parliament that his government would not spare efforts to regain the two cities (Ceuta and Melilla). The next day, November 1, Abbas el Fassi asked the King of Spain to "waive" the trip, while the Minister and Speaker of the Moroccan government, [[Khalid Naciri]], expressed the "total rejection and condemnation" of the royal visit to "despoiled Moroccan cities." Abbas el Fassi, however, at the time said the Spanish press that there was no coercion and that the conflict "must be approached with intelligence, mutual respect, dialogue and concertation."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;

On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I was visiting Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi compared the situation of Ceuta and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.

{{Quote|Decolonization continues to be topical in the few spots that remain in the world, including occupied Palestine, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla ....}}

The same opinion was pronounced by the leader of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party, [[Mustafa Ramid]], by manifesting in the Parliament that "the Moroccans living under Spanish colonization are as our fellow Palestinians under Israeli colonization."&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt;

===Manifestations of King Mohamed VI===
On November 6, after holding a Council of Ministers before intervening in the acts of commemoration of the [[Green March]] in the Parliament, Moroccan King Mohamed VI issued a harsh condemnation through a personnel spokesman:&lt;ref name="condemnation"/&gt;
{{quotation|Strongly we express our strong condemnation and as firmly denounce this unprecedented visit. [...] Given this act was to overcome a nostalgic and dark era, the Spanish authorities must assume their responsibility for the consequences that could jeopardize the future and the development of relations between both countries. [...]}}

In the same statement Mohamed VI called for the formal opening of negotiations on the two cities:
{{quotation|It is well established that the best way to resolve conflict and manage this land requires respect for the virtues of an honest dialogue, frank and open about the future, a dialogue that ensures our right to sovereignty and to take into account the interests of Spain. [...] Morocco has continued to demand an end to the Spanish occupation of Ceuta and Melilla and nearby islands in the plundered north of the kingdom.}}

===Reactions of the Moroccan government after the visit of the King===
On 15 November, the government spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, stated that he hoped that the Spanish "place their hand into ours to overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis." Do not set a date for the return of the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties about the future of the Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that "our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Marruecos/quiere/Espana/le/coja/mano/superar/juntos/crisis/diplomatica/elpepuesp/20071115elpepunac_11/Tes|title= Marruecos quiere que España "le coja la mano" para superar juntos la crisis diplomática|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 15, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco wants Spain "to hold their hand" to overcome diplomatic crisis together|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the [[Ministry of Public Works and Transport (Spain)|Minister of Public Works]], [[Magdalena Álvarez]], who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport [[Karim Ghellab]] about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the [[Strait of Gibraltar|strait]] (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the [[Army of Spain]], Admiral [[Sebastian Zaragoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Marruecos/muestra/enfado/cancelando/visita/ministra/Fomento/elpepuint/20071117elpepuint_6/Tes|title= Marruecos muestra su enfado cancelando una visita de la ministra de Fomento|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 17, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Morocco shows its anger by canceling a visit of the Minister of Development|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position of the Spanish Government==
On the same day, November 1, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain]], [[Miguel Angel Moratinos]], who was visiting the Moroccan city of [[Marrakech]], reported orally to the Moroccan Foreign Minister [[Taieb Fassi-Fihri]], despite the manifestations of the Prime Minister, that the King of Spain would visit the cities of Ceuta and Melilla on 5 and 6 November as planned. That same day, in the usual appearance of the Government of Spain after the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Second Deputy Prime Minister [[Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega]] said that relations with the Moroccan government "were extraordinary" and the journey of the Kings fell within the "institutional normality."&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; Foreign Affairs Minister, Moratinos ruled out an action similar withdrawing the ambassador of Spain in [[Rabat]], Spanish diplomatic sources said.&lt;ref name="elpais3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Mohamed/VI/retira/embajador/pone/relacion/borde/crisis/elpepunac/20071103elpepinac_1/Tes|title= Mohamed VI retira a su embajador y pone la relación al borde de la crisis|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= December 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Mohamed VI withdraws its ambassador and put the relationship on the verge of crisis|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, Defense Minister [[Jose Antonio Alonso]], in a statement to the [[Cadena SER]] said that he hoped the gesture of calling the ambassador-step prior to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, he repeated the words said by Deputy Prime Minister the previous day on the normality of the visit.&lt;ref name="elpais4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Parlamentarios/marroquies/convocan/protesta/Embajada/Espana/lunes/elpepuesp/20071103elpepunac_2/Tes|title= Parlamentarios marroquíes convocan una protesta ante la Embajada de España el lunes|first= Ignacio|last= Cembrero|date= November 3, 2007|publisher= [[El País]]|location= Madrid|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moroccan parliamentarians convened a protest outside the Embassy of Spain on Monday|accessdate= December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed on November 14 its confidence in the return of the Moroccan ambassador in Madrid "as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=90114&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|title= Confía Moratinos en rápido fin de la crisis con Marruecos|publisher= El Financiero|language= Spanish|trans-title=Moratinos confident quick end to the crisis with Morocco|accessdate= December 16, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612084731/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=90114&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC|archivedate= June 12, 2008|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reactions==

===Political reactions in Spain===
The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] and [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] political parties, through [[Angel Acebes]] and [[Gaspar Llamazares]], respectively, announced their support for the visit of the King of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla.&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt; [[Gustavo de Arístegui]], of the People Party, termed Mohamed VI's reaction as "excessive" and criticized the Spanish Prime Minister for failing to make clear, in his view, the 'red lines' that Morocco could not cross.&lt;ref name="elpais3"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Elena Valenciano]], International Relations Secretary of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], stressed that the visit was part of "the most absolute institutional normality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europapress.es/00069/20071102152534/marruecos-psoe-cree-desafortunados-algunos-comentarios-rabat-visita-reyes-ceuta-melilla.html|title= PSOE cree desafortunados algunos comentarios de Rabat sobre la visita de los Reyes a Ceuta y Melilla|date= November 2, 2007|publisher= [[Europa Press (news agency)|Europa Press]]|language= Spanish|trans-title=PSOE believes Rabat's certain comments on the visit of the Kings to Ceuta and Melilla as unfortunate|accessdate= December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10332">An '''administrative centre''' is a seat of regional administration or [[local government]], or a [[county town]], or the place where the central administration of a [[Township|commune]] is located.

In countries which have French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate ''capoluogo''), a '''chef-lieu''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛfljø}}, plural form ''chefs-lieux'' (literally "chief place" or "head place"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. 

==Algeria==
The capital of an [[provinces of Algeria|Algerian Province]] is called a '''chef-lieu'''. The capital of a [[districts of Algeria|district]], the next largest division, is also called a '''chef-lieu'''. While the capital of the lowest division, the [[municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]], is called '''agglomeration de chef-lieu''' (chef-lieu  [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]) and is abbreviated as '''A.C.L.'''

==Belgium==
The '''chef-lieu''' in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten [[Provinces of Belgium]].  Three of these cities also give their name to their province ([[Antwerp]], [[Liège]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]).

==Luxembourg==

Luxembourg is divided into two judicial [[arrondissement]]s (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve [[Cantons of Luxembourg|canton]]s and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: ''Gemengen'').

Arrondissements, districts and cantons have each a '''chef-lieu''' and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.

==France==
The '''chef-lieu of a [[departments of France|département]]''' is known as the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]''. This is the town or city where the [[prefect]] of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the [[prefecture]]. In every [[French region]], one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of ''Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…'' and the city where the regional prefect is found is known  as ''chef-lieu of the  region'' or,  more commonly, ''Regional prefecture''. The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment.  

The '''chef-lieu of an [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]''', commonly known as the ''[[Subprefectures in France|sous-préfecture]]'' is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the [[sub-prefecture]]. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the ''Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture'', who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[cantons of France|canton]]''' is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it.  In past decades, there was always a [[Gendarmerie]], a treasurer and a justice of the peace.  

The '''chef-lieu of a [[communes of France|commune]]''' is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.

==Jordan==
In the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the administrative centres are known as "chief towns" or [[Nahias of Jordan|''nahias'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Annex B: Analysis of the municipal sector |work=Third Tourism Development Project, Secondary Cities Revitalization Study |date=24 May 2005 |page=4 |publisher=Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan |url=http://www.mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052114/http://mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (''qda''), a district (''liwa''), or a [[Governorates of Jordan|governorate]] (''muhafazah'').

==New Caledonia==
The '''chef-lieu''' indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So [[Nouméa]] is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So [[Wé]] is part of the town of [[Lifou]], but is the chef-lieu of Lifou.  In the [[Loyalty Islands]] and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.

==Francophone West Africa==
Many of the West African states which gained independence from [[France]] in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a ''Chief-Lieu''.  States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include [[Senegal]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], and [[Niger]]l.&lt;ref&gt;Bierschenk T., Olivier de Sardan, J.‑P. (eds), 1998, "Les arènes locales face à la décentralisation et démocratisation. Analyses comparatives en milieu rural béninois", in Bierschenk T. &amp; Olivier de Sardan J.-P. (eds), Les pouvoirs au village. Le Bénin rural entre démocratisation et décentralisation, Paris, Karthala : 11‑51.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Taking [[Communes of Niger|Niger]] and [[Communes of Mali|Mali]] as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu.  The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of [[French West Africa]], and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Fay [La décentralisation dans un Cercle (Tenenkou, Mali). Autrepart: Logiques identitaires, logiques territoriales, 2000, IRD http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/autrepart/010021949.pdf#page=122].&lt;/ref&gt;  With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, [[Cercles of Mali]]/[[Departments of Niger]], and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Bréhima Béridogo, [« Processus de Décentralisation au Mali et Couches Sociales Marginalisées », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/581]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for Mali, see Bréhima Kassibo, [« La Décentralisation au Mali : État des Lieux », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997  http://apad.revues.org/579]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''chefs-lieux'' of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a "High Council of Collectivites" seated at the nation's capital.  Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a ''Place''/''Site'' (''Site'' in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the ''Chief-Place'' even at the lowest level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-17%20regime%20financier.pdf REPUBLIQUE DU NIGER Loi n° 2002-017 du 11 JUIN 2002 déterminant le régime financier des Régions, des Départements et des Communes]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Includes list of 213 communes rurales and seats, 52 Communes urbaines and seats.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
In [[Russia]], the term is applied to the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited localities]], which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the [[republics of Russia|republics]], for which the term "[[capital city|capital]]" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in [[Ukraine]].

==Switzerland==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is applied to the capital of each [[Swiss canton]].  In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.

==Tunisia==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is used to designate the capital of each  '''gouvernorat''' (department).  Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into '''delegations'''  (districts) which each have a central city as '''chef-lieu of delegation'''.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] it is the centre of a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]], which is distinct from a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|historic county]] with a county town.

==Popular culture==
* ''The Fiancée of the pirate'' (1969) is a film by [[Nelly Kaplan]], where the action takes place in a hamlet where everyone spends their time worrying about what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town.

The '''Alhambra Decree''' (also known as the '''Edict of Expulsion'''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Decreto de la Alhambra, Edicto de Granada'') was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Spain]] ([[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]) ordering the expulsion of practicing [[Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year.&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html|title=The Edict of Expulsion of the Jews - 1492 Spain|website=www.sephardicstudies.org|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large ''[[converso]]'' population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to continuing attacks around 50,000 more had converted by 1415.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience|last=Gerber|first=Jane|publisher=The Free Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0029115749|location=New York|pages=1-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further number of those remaining chose to convert to avoid expulsion. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled, an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_a_Tragedy.html?id=GKYlN1ySFOYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of a Tragedy: The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|last=Pérez|first=Joseph|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007|isbn=9780252031410|location=|pages=|language=en|translator-last=Hochroth|translator-first=Lysa|author-link=Joseph Pérez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:17&lt;/sup&gt;

The edict was formally and symbolically revoked on 16 December 1968,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html "1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain"], ''The New York Times'', Dec. 17, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Second Vatican Council]]. This was a full century after Jews had been openly practicing their religion in Spain and synagogues were once more legal places of worship under Spain's Laws of Religious Freedom.

In 1924, the regime of Primo de Rivera granted Spanish citizenship to the entire Sephardic Jewish diaspora. In 2014, the government of Spain passed a law allowing [[dual citizenship]] to Jewish descendants who apply, to "compensate for shameful events in the country's past."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/sephardic-jews-eager-to-apply-for-spanish-citizenship/2014/02/17/e56978dc-9810-11e3-ae45-458927ccedb6_story.html "Sephardic Jews eager to apply for Spanish citizenship"], ''Washington Post'', Feb. 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Sephardi Jews]] who can prove they are the descendants of those Jews expelled from Spain because of  the Alhambra Decree can "become Spaniards without leaving home or giving up their present nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21596963-offer-right-past-wrong-may-not-lead-huge-influx-people-1492-and-all "1492 and all that"], ''The Economist'', Feb. 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/opinion/repatriating-spains-jews.html|title=Repatriating Spain’s Jews|last=Stavans|first=Ilan|date=2014-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|History of the Jews in Spain}}

By the end of the 8th century, [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim]] forces had conquered and settled most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Islamic law, the [[Jews]] who had lived in the region since at least [[Roman Empire|Roman times]], were considered "[[People of the Book]]," which was a protected status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ornament of the world: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain|last=Menocal|first=María Rosa|date=|publisher=Back Bay Books|year=2012|isbn=9780316168717|edition=Reprint|location=|pages=|oclc=183353253|author-link=María Rosa Menocal|orig-year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the repressive policies of the Visigothic kingdom, who, starting in the sixth-century had enacted a series of anti-Jewish statutes which culminated in their forced conversion and enslavement, the tolerance of the Muslim Moorish rulers of ''[[al-Andalus]]'' allowed Jewish communities to thrive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jewish merchants were able to trade freely across the Islamic world, which allowed them to flourish, and made Jewish enclaves in Muslim Iberian cities great centers of learning and commerce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to a flowering of Jewish culture, as Jewish scholars were able to gain favor in Muslim courts as skilled physicians, diplomats, translators, and poets.  Although Jews never enjoyed equal status to Muslims, in some [[Taifa|Taifas]], such as [[Taifa of Granada|Granada]], Jewish men were appointed to very high offices, including Grand Vizier.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/ha-nagid.asp&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muslim forces did not control the entire peninsula.

The ''[[Reconquista]]'', or the gradual reconquest of Muslim Iberia by the [[Christian]] kingdoms in the North, was driven by a powerful religious motivation: to reclaim Iberia for [[Christendom]] following the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] centuries before. By the 14th century, most of the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Spain and [[Portugal]]) had been reconquered by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]].

During the Christian re-conquest, the Muslim kingdoms in Spain became less welcoming to the ''[[dhimmi]]''. In the late twelfth century, the Muslims in al-Andalus invited the fanatical [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] dynasty from North Africa to push the Christians back to the North.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After they gained control of the Iberian Peninsula, the Almohads offered the Sephardim a choice between expulsion, conversion, and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many Jewish people fled to other parts of the Muslim world, and also to the Christian kingdoms, which initially welcomed them. In Christian Spain, Jews functioned as courtiers, government officials, merchants, and moneylenders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the Jewish community was both useful to the ruling classes and to an extent protected by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faith of the Fallen Jews: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and the Writing of Jewish History (The Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)|publisher=Brandeis University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1611684872|editor-last=Kaye|editor-first=Alexander|location=Massachusetts|pages=252-253|editor-last2=Meyers|editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion of rights the Sephardim had enjoyed under the Muslims, in Christian territories was slow and in some areas barely perceptible.

As the [[Reconquista]] drew to a close, overt hostility against Jews in Christian Spain became more pronounced, finding expression in brutal episodes of violence and oppression. In the early fourteenth century, the Christian kings vied to prove their piety by allowing the clergy to subject the Jewish population to forced sermons and disputations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More deadly attacks came later in the century from mobs of angry Catholics, led by popular preachers, who would storm into the Jewish quarter, destroy synagogues, and break into houses, forcing the inhabitants to choose between conversion and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thousands of Jews sought to escape these attacks by converting to Christianity.These Jewish converts were commonly called ''[[converso]]s'', [[New Christian]]s, or ''[[marrano]]s''; the latter two terms were used as insults. At first these conversions seemed an effective solution to the cultural conflict: many ''converso'' families met with social and commercial success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But eventually their success made these new Catholics unpopular with their neighbors, including some of the clergy of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and Spanish aristocrats competing with them for influence over the royal families. By the mid-fifteenth century, the demands of the Old Christians, that the Catholic Church and the monarchy differentiate them from the conversos, led to the first ''[[Limpieza de sangre|Limpieza de Sangre]]'' laws, which restricted opportunities for converts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These suspicions on the part of Christians were only heightened by the fact that some of the coerced conversions were undoubtedly insincere. Some, but not all, ''conversos'' had understandably chosen to salvage their social and commercial positions or their lives by the only option open to them – baptism and embrace of Christianity – while privately adhering to their Jewish practice and faith. Recently converted families who continued to intermarry were especially viewed with suspicion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These secret practitioners are commonly referred to as [[crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] or ''marranos''.

The existence of crypto-Jews was a provocation for secular and [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leaders who were already hostile toward Spain's Jewry. For their part, the Jewish community viewed conversos with compassion, because Jewish law held that conversion under threat of violence was not necessarily legitimate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the Catholic Church was also officially opposed to forced conversion, under ecclesiastical law all baptisms were lawful, and once baptized, converts were not allowed to rejoin their former religion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The uncertainty over the sincerity of Jewish converts added fuel to the fire of [[antisemitism]] in 15th century Spain.

===European context===
{{Main|History of the Jews in Europe}}
[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]

From the 13th to the 16th centuries European countries expelled the Jews from their territory on at least 15 occasions. Before the Spanish expulsion, the Jews were expelled from England in 1290 and multiple times from France between 1182 and 1354. The French case is typical of most expulsions, because whether they were local or national, the Jews were usually invited back a few years later.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe|last=Stow|first=Kenneth|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0674015937|location=Massachusetts|pages=181-308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were also expelled from some of the German states. The Spanish expulsion was succeeded by at least five more expulsions, from other European countries.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7065-1327-4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Israel Pocket Library|last=|first=|publisher=Keter Books|year=1974|isbn=9780706513271|volume=12|location=Jerusalem, IS|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teacher's"&gt;{{cite web |title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe |url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/gallery/expuls.htm |work=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust  |publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida |access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain was both the largest of its kind, and officially the longest in Western European history.

Over the four hundred year period the majority of these decrees were implemented, the meaning of the expulsions gradually changed. At first, the expulsions of the Jews, or lack thereof, were exercises of kingly prerogative. Jewish communities in Europe were often protected by and associated with European monarchs in the Middle Ages, because under the feudal system, the Jews were often the monarch’s only reliable tax base.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, the Jews had the reputation of moneylenders because they were the only group allowed to loan money at a profit under the prevailing interpretation of the [[Vulgate|Vulgate (Latin; official for Catholics) Bible]], which forbid Christians from collecting interest.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, the Jews were the creditors of the merchants, the aristocrats, and even the monarchs. Most expulsions were centered on this issue: the monarch would tax the Jewish community heavily, forcing them to call in loans, and then expel them. At the time of expulsion, the monarch would seize their remaining valuable assets, including the debts owed by the aristocrats and the merchants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, expulsion of the Jews from Spain was unique not only in scale, but in its ideological motivations.

===Ferdinand and Isabella===
{{Main|Catholic Monarchs}}

Hostility towards the Jews in Spain was brought to a climax during the reign of the “Catholic Monarchs,” [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]]. Their marriage in 1469, which formed a [[personal union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], with coordinated policies between their distinct kingdoms, eventually led to the final unification of Spain.

Although their initial policies towards the Jews were protective, Ferdinand and Isabella were disturbed by reports claiming that most Jewish converts to Christianity were insincere in their conversion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As mentioned above, some accusations that [[Converso|''conversos'']] continued to practice Judaism in secret (see [[Crypto-Judaism]]) were true, but the “Old” Christians exaggerated the scale of the problem. More serious were the accusations that the Jews were trying to draw conversos back into the Jewish fold. In 1478, Ferdinand and Isabella made a formal application to [[Holy See|Rome]] to set up an Inquisition in Castile to investigate these and other suspicions. In 1487, King Ferdinand promoted the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] Tribunals in Castile.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Aragon, it had been first instituted in 13th century to combat the Albigense heresy. However, the focus of this new Inquisition was to find and punish ''conversos'' who were practicing Judaism in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DoY6VKNSC0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Imperial Spain 1469-1716|last=Huxtable|first=Elliott John|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=9780141925578|location=London, UK|pages=|oclc=759581255|orig-year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These issues came to a head during Ferdinand and Isabella’s final conquest of Granada. The independent Islamic [[Emirate of Granada]] had been a [[tributary state]] to Castile since 1238. Jews and conversos played an important role during this campaign, because they had the ability to raise money and acquire weapons through their extensive trade networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This perceived increase in Jewish influence further infuriated the Old Christians and the hostile elements of the clergy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, in 1491 in preparation for an imminent transition to Castilian territory, the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)|Treaty of Granada]] was signed by Emir [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]] and the Queen of Castile, protecting the religious freedom of the Muslims there. By 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella had won the [[Battle of Granada]] and completed the Catholic [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula from Islamic [[Al-Andalus|forces]]. However, the Jewish population emerged from the campaign more hated by the populace and less useful to the monarchs.

==Decree==
[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A signed copy of the Edict of Expulsion]]
The king and queen issued the Alhambra Decree less than three months after the surrender of Granada. Although Isabella was the force behind the decision, her husband Fernando did not oppose it, and both proved skillful at exploiting the hopes of the desperate Jewish population for monetary gain.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  That her [[confessor]] had just changed from the tolerant [[Hernando de Talavera]] to the very intolerant [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] suggests an increase in royal hostility towards the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.il/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/Other_Hispanic_Topics/Cisneros_y_la_quema_de_los_manuscritos_granadinos.htm&amp;prev=search|title=Cisneros y la quema de los manuscritos granadinos|last=Eisenberg|first=Daniel|date=|year=1993|website=|publisher=Journal of Hispanic Philology|pages=107–124|trans-title=Cisneros and the Burning of the Grenadinian Manuscripts|orig-year=1992|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 June 2017|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful proponent of the decision however, was Torquemada, the priest in charge of the Spanish Inquisition.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The text of the decree accused the Jews of trying "to subvert the holy Catholic faith” by attempting to "draw faithful Christians away from their beliefs."&lt;ref name="Decree-translation" /&gt; These measures were [[Edward I of England#Finances.2C Parliament and the expulsion of Jews|not new in Europe]].

After the decree was passed, Spain's entire Jewish population was given only four months to either convert to Christianity or leave the country. The edict promised the Jews' royal "protection and security" for the effective three-month window before the deadline. They were permitted to take their belongings with them, excluding “gold or silver or minted money or other things prohibited by the laws of our kingdoms."&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"/&gt; In practice, however, the Jews had to sell anything they could not carry: their land, their houses, and their libraries, and converting their wealth to a more portable form proved difficult. The market in Spain was saturated with these goods, which meant the prices were artificially lowered for the months before the deadline. As a result, much of the wealth of the Jewish community remained in Spain. The punishment for any Jew who did not convert or leave by the deadline was [[summary execution]].&lt;ref name="Decree-translation" /&gt;

===Dispersal===
The Sephardic Jews migrated to four major areas: North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, and Italy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some [[Sephardi Jews|Spanish Jews]] who emigrated to avoid conversion [[Jewish diaspora|dispersed]]  throughout the region of North Africa known as the [[Maghreb]]. The Jewish scholars and physicians among previous Sephardic immigrants to this area had reinvigorated the Jewish communities in North Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in the 1490s, parts of the Mediterranean world, including Morocco were experiencing severe famine. As a result, a number of cities in Morocco refused to let the Spanish Jews in. This led to mass starvation among the refugees, and made the Jewish refugees vulnerable to the predation of slavers, although the regional ruler invalidated many of these sales within a few years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A good number of the Jews who had fled to North Africa returned to Spain and got converted. The Jews who stayed in North Africa often intermingled with the already existing [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Arabic or Berber speaking communities, becoming the ancestors of the Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan Jewish communities.

Many Spanish Jews also fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they were given refuge. Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of [[Thessaloniki]] (currently in [[Greece]]) and [[İzmir]] (currently in [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Turkey.html "Turkey"], ''Jewish Virtual Library''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these Jews also settled in other parts of the Balkans ruled by the Ottomans such as the areas that are now Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia. Concerning this incident, Bayezid II is alleged to have commented, "those who say that Ferdinand and Isabella are wise are indeed fools; for he gives me, his enemy, his national treasure, the Jews."

A majority of Sephardim migrated to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], where they gained [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|only a few years of respite from persecution]]. About 600 Jewish families were allowed to stay in Portugal following an exorbitant bribe, until the Portuguese king entered negotiations to marry the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Caught between his desire for an alliance with Spain and his economic reliance on the Jews, Manuel I declared the Jewish community in Portugal (perhaps then some 10% of that country's population)&lt;ref&gt;Kayserling, Meyer. "História dos Judeus em Portugal". Editora Pioneira, São Paulo, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Christians by royal decree unless they left the country. In return, he promised the Inquisition would not come to Portugal for 40 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He then seized the Jews who tried to leave and had them forcibly baptized, after separating them from their children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was years before the Jews who fled to Portugal were allowed to emigrate. When the ban was lifted, many of them fled to the Low Countries, or the Netherlands. 

Throughout history, scholars have given widely differing numbers of Jews expelled from Spain. However, the figure is likely to be below the 100,000 Jews who had not yet converted to Christianity by 1492, possibly as low as 40,000. Such figures exclude the significant number of Jews who returned to Spain due to the hostile reception they received in their countries of refuge, notably [[Fez]] (Morocco). The situation of returnees was legalized with the Ordinance of the 10 of November 1492 which established that civil and church authorities should be witness to baptism and, in the case that they were baptized before arrival, proof and witnesses of baptism were required. Furthermore, all property could be recovered by returnees at the same price at which it was sold. Similarly the Provision of the Royal Council of 24 of October 1493 set harsh sanctions for those who slandered these New Christians with insulting terms such as ''tornadizos''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:115&lt;/sup&gt; After all, the Catholic monarchs were concerned with the souls of their subjects, and Catholic doctrine held that the persecution of converts would remove an important incentive for conversion. Returnees are documented as late as 1499.

===Conversions===
A majority of Spain's Jewish population had converted to Christianity during the waves of religious persecutions prior to the Decree—a total of 200,000 converts according to Joseph Pérez.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main objective of the expulsion of practicing Jews was  ensuring the sincerity of the conversions of such a large convert population. Of the 100,000 Jews that remained true to their faith by 1492, an additional number chose to convert and join the converso community rather than face expulsion. Recent conversos were subject to additional suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established to persecute religious heretics, but in Spain and Portugal was focused on finding crypto-Jews. Although Judaism was not considered a heresy, professing Christianity while engaging in Jewish practices was heretical. Additionally, ''Limpieza de Sangre'' statutes instituted legal discrimination against converso descendants, barring them from certain positions and forbidding them from immigrating to the Americas. For years, families with urban origins who had extensive trade connections, and people who were learned and multilingual were suspected of having Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the prejudice of the time, a person with Jewish blood was untrustworthy and inferior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such measures slowly faded away as converso identity was forgotten and this community merged into Spain's dominant Catholic culture. This process lasted until the eighteenth century, with a few exceptions, most notably the [[Chuetas]] of the island of [[Majorca]], where discrimination lasted into early 20th Century.

A [[Y chromosome]] [[DNA testing|DNA test]] conducted by the [[University of Leicester]] and the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] has indicated an average of nearly 20% for Spaniards having some direct patrilineal descent from populations from the Near East which colonized the region either in historical times, such as [[Jews]] and [[Phoenicians]], or during earlier prehistoric [[Neolithic]] migrations. Between the 90,000 Jews who converted under the Visigoth persecutions, and the 100,000+ Jews who converted in the years leading up to expulsion, it is likely that many of these people have Jewish ancestry. On the other hand, genetic studies have dispelled local beliefs in the American South West that Spanish Americans are the descendants of conversos.&lt;ref name="FloresMaca-Meyer2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Carlos |last2=Maca-Meyer |first2=Nicole |last3=González |first3=Ana M |last4=Oefner |first4=Peter J |last5=Shen |first5=Peidong |last6=Pérez |first6=Jose A |last7=Rojas |first7=Antonio |last8=Larruga |first8=Jose M |last9=Underhill |first9=Peter A |title=Reduced genetic structure of the Iberian peninsula revealed by Y-chromosome analysis: implications for population demography |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=12 |issue=10 |year=2004 |pages=855–863 |issn=1018-4813 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201225 |pmid=15280900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12627534 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.10168 | volume=120 | issue=4 | title=Mitochondrial DNA affinities at the Atlantic fringe of Europe |date=April 2003 | journal=Am.

==Modern Spanish policy==
The Spanish government has actively pursued a policy of reconciliation with the descendants of its expelled Jews. In 1924, the regime of Primo de Rivera granted Spanish citizenship to the entire Sephardic Jewish diaspora. As stated above, the Alhambra decree was officially revoked in 1968, after the Second Vatican Council rejected the charge of deicide traditionally attributed to the Jews. In 1992, in a ceremony marking the 500th anniversary of the Edict of Expulsion, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] (wearing a [[Kippah|yarmulke]]) prayed alongside Israeli president [[Chaim Herzog]] and members of the Jewish community in the [[Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid, Spain)|Beth Yaacov Synagogue]]. The King said, "[[Sepharad|Sefarad]] (the Hebrew name for Spain) isn't a nostalgic memory anymore; it is a place where it must not be said that Jews should simply 'feel' at home there, for indeed Hispano-Jews are at home in Spain...What matters is not accountability for what we may have done wrong or right, but the willingness to look to the future, and analyze the past in light of our future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elpais.com/diario/1992/04/01/espana/702079221_850215.html |title=El Rey celebra en la sinagoga de Madrid "el encuentro con los judíos españoles" |last=Cembrero |first=Ignacio |date=1 April 1992 |access-date=9 September 2016 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The King celebrates the "meeting with Spanish Jews" in the Madrid synagogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 2012 Sephardi Jews have had the right to automatic Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. Prior to November 2012, Sephardi Jews already had the right to obtain Spanish citizenship after a reduced residency period of two years (versus ten years for foreigners but natural from Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, Brazil and about other 20 American republics than also require 2 years.) While their citizenship is being processed, Sephardi Jews are entitled to the consular protection of the Kingdom of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/world/europe/spain-citizenship-process-eased-for-sephardic-jews.html |title=Spain: Citizenship Process Eased for Sephardic Jews |last=Minder |first=Raphael |publisher=The New York Times |date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Spain unique among European nations as the only nation that currently grants automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews expelled during the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|European medieval evictions]]. Although these measures are popular in the Jewish community, they have also sparked some controversy. A minority of thinkers hold that these policies represent less the abnegation of prejudice as a shift to [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semitism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As of November 2015, 4300 Sephardi Jews have benefited from this law and acquired Spanish citizenship, swearing allegiance to the Spanish Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/11/30/actualidad/1448887588_869275.html |title=El Rey, a los sefardíes: "¡Cuánto os hemos echado de menos!" |publisher=El País |date=30 November 2015 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The King, the Sephardim, "How I've missed you!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of Jews in Spain was estimated to range between 40,000 and 50,000 people.

The '''Australian Conservatives''' is an Australian [[political party]] formed and led by [[Cory Bernardi]] as a breakaway from the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.org.au/about|title=About|work=conservatives.org.au|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had been established as a conservative political activist group in July 2016, as response to the results of the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]]. It was formed as a political party after Bernardi's resignation from the Liberals, following disagreements with the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]], its policies and leadership under [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. The [[Family First Party]] and their two state incumbents [[Dennis Hood]] and [[Robert Brokenshire]] joined and merged with the Australian Conservatives in April 2017. Brokenshire was not re-elected at the [[South Australian state election, 2018|2018 state election]]; Hood left the Conservatives to join the [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|Liberal Party of Australia]] on 26 March 2018.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-26/australian-conservatives-mp-dennis-hood-joins-liberals/9586822 |title=Dennis Hood dumps Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to join SA Liberals |first=Nick |last=Harmsen |newspaper=ABC News |date=26 March 2018 |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger with Family First===
On 25 April 2017, it was announced that the [[Family First Party]] would merge with the Australian Conservatives, with its two members of the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] joining the party.&lt;ref name="merger-aus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=The Urge to merge – Family First and the Australian Conservatives |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2017/04/the-urge-to-merge-family-first-and-the-australian-conservatives.html |accessdate=4 May 2017 |work=ABC |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly-appointed Family First senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when Family First was disbanded.&lt;ref name="merger-abc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bernardi's Australian Conservatives to merge with Family First|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-25/cory-bernardi-australian-conservatices-to-merge-with-family/8471244?smid=abcnews-Twitter_Organic&amp;WT.tsrc=Twitter_Organic&amp;sf73113548=1|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=ABC News|date=25 April 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gichuhi was invited to join the Australian Conservatives' voting bloc in the Senate,&lt;ref name="bloc"/&gt; but ultimately chose to join the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/australian-success-story-pm-welcomes-gichuhi-to-liberals|title='Australian success story': PM welcomes Gichuhi to Liberals|work=SBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family First was generally considered to be part of the [[Christian right]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the [[Pentecostal church]] in South Australia, and nationally with smaller Christian denominations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] via [[Robert Brokenshire]] and [[Bob Day]]. The party advocated a moral and family values agenda, but Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to Bernardi's Conservatives.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

However,according to John Macaulay, an executive of the Australian Conservatives Board, and the dissolution document of Family First, the Party did not merge with the Australian Conservtives. The Family First executive voted to dissolve the party, and in accordance with Australian law, they donated all their assets to the Australian Conservative Party. &lt;ref&gt;Family First Dissolution Document&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

===Electoral performance===
The party made modest showings at the [[Bennelong by-election, 2017| 2017 Bennelong]] and [[Batman by-election, 2018|2018 Batman]] by-elections, achieving primary vote of 4.29% and 6.41%, respectively, the latter in the absence of [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] candidate, failing to elect a candidate in either instance. In March 2018, the party lost both upper house representatives in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]], with the failure to reelect [[Robert Brokenshire]], and the defection of parliamentary leader [[Dennis Hood]] to the Liberal Party, which nine days prior had won government in the [[South Australian state election, 2018|state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cory Bernardi lashes out at former colleagues over 'plans to defect to Liberals'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-28/bernardi-feels-whiteanted-by-former-conservative-colleagues/9598048|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=ABC News|date=28 March 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the election, the Australian Conservatives suffered a −3.2% swing (from a Family First vote of 6.2% in [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014]]) for a lower house primary vote of 3.0%, and a −0.9% swing (from a Family First vote of 4.4% in 2014) for an upper house primary vote of 3.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/sa-election-2018/results/ 2018 SA election results: ABC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://results.ecsa.sa.gov.au 2018 SA election results: ECSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2576">A '''ballot measure''' is a piece of proposed [[legislation]] to be approved or rejected by eligible [[voter]]s. Ballot measures are also known as "propositions" or simply "questions".

Ballot measures differ from most legislation passed by [[representative democracies]]; ordinarily, an [[election|elected]] [[legislature]] develops and passes laws. Ballot measures, by contrast, are an example of [[direct democracy]].

In the [[United States]] ballot measures may be established by several different processes which vary amongst the states:&lt;ref&gt;[[Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute]] (2013). [http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Quick%20Fact%20-%20What%20is%20I&amp;R.htm What are ballot propositions, initiatives, and referendums?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725175114/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Quick%20Fact%20-%20What%20is%20I%26R.htm |date=2010-07-25 }}. USC.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Initiative]], in which any citizen or organization may gather a predetermined number of [[signature]]s to qualify a measure for the [[ballot]];
* [[Popular referendum]], in which a predetermined number of signatures (typically lower than the number required for an initiative) qualifies a ballot measure repealing a specific act of the legislature;
* [[Legislative referral]] (a.k.a. "legislative referendum"), in which the legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a [[constitutional amendment]] as a required procedure).

In [[Switzerland]], same kind of ballot measures are known as ''[[votations]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Berkeley school of political theory''' is a [[school of thought]] in [[political theory]] associated originally with the work of faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], some of whom formulated and popularized its ideas. The school of thought was founded by [[Sheldon Wolin]], [[Hanna Pitkin]],&lt;ref&gt;"In light of Pitkin's long association with Berkeley, it is no surprise that academic lore frequently connects her work to a 'Berkeley School' of political theory, said to have flourished in the 1960s and '70s.", Mathiowetz, 2016, p.5 of the PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Michael Rogin]], [[John Schaar]], and [[Norman Jacobson]], among others, and has been carried on by theorists including [[Wilson Carey McWilliams]] and [[J. Peter Euben]].&lt;ref name="grimes-obit"&gt;William Grimes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/us/politics/sheldon-s-wolin-theorist-who-shifted-political-science-back-to-politics-dies-at-93.html "Sheldon S.

The Berkeley school has been characterized as returning political theory back in the direction of politics and political action, and away from efforts to center "scientific" models such as economics, psychology, sociology, and the natural sciences, specifically [[behavioralism]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref name="mathiowetz-2016"&gt;Mathiowetz, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes-obit" /&gt;

== Research and campaigns ==
In 2017, research by British Future suggested that the [[Conservative Party (UK)]] would have claimed a 42-seat majority in the [[2017 general election]] if they had the same level of support among ethnic minority Britons as they do with white voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Walker|title=‘Ethnic minority voting gap’ cost Theresa May 28 seats, report says|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/28/ethnic-minority-voting-gap-cost-theresa-may-28-seats-report-says |accessdate=5 April 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada's first response''' to the disaster inflicted by [[Hurricane Katrina]] along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline of the [[United States]] was the deployment of a [[Vancouver]] heavy urban search and rescue team, which arrived in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] on the evening of August 31, 2005, arriving on a [[WestJet Airlines]] aircraft. Due to security and logistics issues in the disaster area surrounding New Orleans, the team started operations on September 3, saving 30 people that day.  They returned to Vancouver on September 6, reportedly saving over 110 people during their deployment. It has also accepted some evacuees to stay in [[Canada]].

==Official Canadian government response==

The official response by the Government of Canada to the Gulf coast disaster came on September 2, following discussions between [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada]] and the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].  The federal government announced it was deploying a task force comprising three [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|warships]]&amp;mdash;{{HMCS|Athabaskan|DDG 282|6}}, {{HMCS|Toronto|FFH 333|6}} and {{HMCS|Ville de Québec|FFH 332|6}}&amp;mdash;along with the [[Canadian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] vessel {{ship|CCGS|Sir William Alexander}} and three [[Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King|Sea King helicopters]] and one [[Eurocopter BO 105|BO-105 helicopter]] to the area.

The Canadian Forces also provided several [[CH-146 Griffon|Griffon helicopters]] and crews to the [[New England]] States at the request of the [[United States Coast Guard]] whose search and rescue helicopters from that area have been assigned to Gulf Coast SAR operations. Canadian aircraft were deployed as part of a [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) military assistance pact.

[[File:RCMP and US Infantry outside Canadian Embassy.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. infantry led by the RCMP outside the Canadian Embassy on September 7 to raise funds for Katrina victims.]]

The task force was organized under the name "Operation UNISON" and involved over 1,000 personnel from the Canadian Forces and Canadian Coast Guard who were placed under the operational command of their American counterparts who were coordinating relief operations. A precedent was established with a similar humanitarian aid response by the Government of Canada following [[Hurricane Andrew]] when the Auxiliary Oil Replenishment (AOR) ship {{HMCS|Protecteur|AOR 509|6}} participated in "Operation TEMPEST", providing relief supplies and personnel in southern Florida and the Bahamas.

The ships and aircraft had the capacity to relocate people and deliver a broad range of supplies, including tents, cots, water containers and items such as men's and women's toiletries, sun screen and insect repellent.  At the same time, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] was in contact with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and offered whatever support was required. "We are really prepared to operate on all fronts as requested and as co-ordinated by the United States," said Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]], Canada's Ambassador to the United States said that in addition to the basic desire to help a neighbor in need, many Canadians also remember the ancestors of Louisiana's Cajuns were [[Great Expulsion|expelled]] from what would become Canada by the British in the 18th century, which he felt gave an extra historical dimension to Canadians' desire to help the people of Louisiana during the recovery operation.

On September 4, following a request from U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the Government of Canada announced it was prepared to send thousands of beds, blankets, surgical gloves and dressings and other medical supplies. The Government of Canada announced it would also send 35 divers to help with the rescue effort. One of the divers' tasks would be to inspect levees.

[[File:Canadian relief transport.jpg|thumb|[[United States Navy]] personnel unload Canadian relief supplies from a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] transport aircraft in [[Pensacola, Florida]].]]

On September 5, a team of 35 military divers was deployed from [[CFB Halifax]] and [[CFB Esquimalt]] to Pensacola, Florida. They were tasked with assisting their U.S. Navy counterparts to clear navigational hazards, including unsecured and sunken vessels and debris, and to inspect flood-damaged levees.

On September 6 the Operation UNISON task force of navy and coast guard ships departed [[Halifax Harbour]] for the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The naval ships arrived at Pensacola, Florida several days later, having been delayed by further tropical storm activity off the east coast of Florida.  The coast guard ship arrived several days later, due to its slower cruising speed.  The Operation UNISON task force unloaded relief supplies at Pensacola and was deployed to assist along the Mississippi coast.

On September 19 it was announced that the three warships from the Operation UNISON task force would be returning to Halifax, leaving CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' to continue its mission of clearing navigation hazards and repairing buoys.  On September 28, the coast guard vessel was retasked to assist the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in repairing the network of weather buoys along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the United States, which had been severely damaged by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season; these buoys are one of the most important tools for forecasting and gathering data from oceanic storms. CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' returned to Canada on October 24.

* The [[Canadian Red Cross]]  launched an immediate nationwide appeal for donations to enable the organization to provide aid to its American counterpart.  37 [[Canadian Red Cross]] personnel were transported by Canadian military aircraft to assist with efforts in [[Houston, Texas]]; they were followed by dozens of other Red Cross personnel once the situation assessment was completed.  The American Red Cross asked Canadian Red Cross chapters in Quebec for cots for refugees staying at U.S. evacuation centres and other services were requested from chapters in Ontario.
* The Government of [[Nova Scotia]] donated $100,000 towards the Red Cross effort.  This was followed on September 8 when the Government of [[Alberta]] announced that it was donating $5 million to the Hurricane Katrina fund administered by former presidents [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]].  The cheque was personally given by Premier [[Ralph Klein]] to former president Clinton during a visit to Alberta in October.
* Other provinces expressed interest in providing temporary housing to those left homeless.  Some residents of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] offered shelter to the homeless survivors of hurricane Katrina.  [[Anne McLellan]], the [[Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], announced that her department was discussing with the U.S. National Security Advisor the possibility of Canadians billeting American storm evacuees. Big cities like [[Calgary]], [[Ottawa]], [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], and [[Montreal]] accepted 1,200 evacuees in all .
* Universities across Canada offered to take in university students from New Orleans whose studies have been interrupted.  Some institutions went so far as to offer full tuition scholarships and free room and board.
* [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario|Ontario Hydro]], [[Hydro-Québec]], and [[Manitoba Hydro]], along with other electrical utilities, sent repair crews to assist in restoring electrical power service.
* Canada increased oil exports as requested by the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] to help stabilize the world market in the wake of the crisis and its impact on North American oil production and refining capacity.
* On September 2 [[Air Canada]] participated along with U.S. member airlines of the Air Transport Association, in a voluntary airline industry initiative to support rescue and relief operations. Air Canada was the first foreign carrier to land in New Orleans delivering water and supplies and lifting victims to safety.
* On September 7, the Canadian Embassy started a Hurricane Katrina fund to support victims in the Gulf region.  [[Frank McKenna]], Canadian ambassador to the United States, told Americans "you are our friends and together we are family &amp;ndash; you do not suffer alone."

{{legal status}}
'''Citizenship''' is the status of a person recognized under the [[custom (law)|custom]] or [[law]] as being a legal member of a [[sovereign state]] or belonging to a [[nation]].

A person may have [[multiple citizenship]]s. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be [[Stateless person|stateless]], while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.&lt;ref&gt;Coplan, David. "Introduction: From empiricism to theory in African border studies." Journal of Borderlands Studies 25.2 (2010): 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationality]] is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/slovaknationalityethnicityenglishtranslation.html | title = Nationality, ethnicity in Slovakia. | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; – notably in [[public international law|international law]] – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a [[nation]] (a large [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g. the [[Citizenship of the United States#Citizenship vs. nationality|United States]], [[British nationality law#Classes of British nationality|the United Kingdom]], nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see [[Nationality#Nationality versus citizenship|Nationality versus citizenship]]).

==Determining factors==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
{{further information|Nationality law}}
Each country has its own policies, regulations and criteria as to who is entitled to its citizenship. A person can be recognized or granted citizenship on a number of bases. Usually citizenship based on circumstances of birth is automatic, but in other cases an application may be required.

* Citizenship by birth (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). If one or both of a person's parents are citizens of a given state, then the person may have the right to be a citizen of that state as well.{{efn|Examples: [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/article4.htm Article IV of the Philippine Constitution].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title 8 of the United States Code|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-I 8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Formerly this might only have applied through the paternal line, but [[sex equality]] became common since the late twentieth century. Citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]] and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. Where ''jus sanguinis'' holds, a person born outside a country, one or both of whose parents are citizens of the country, is also a citizen. States normally{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state, although some do not.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.
* Born within a country (''[[jus soli]]''). Some people are automatically citizens of the state in which they are born. This form of citizenship originated in [[England]] where those who were born within the realm were [[British subject#Prior to 1949|subjects of the monarch]] (a concept pre-dating citizenship) and is common in [[common law]] countries.
** In many cases, both ''jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis'' hold citizenship either by place or parentage (or both).
* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jus matrimonii]]''). Many countries fast-track naturalization based on the marriage of a person to a citizen. Countries which are destinations for such immigration often have regulations to try to detect [[sham marriage]]s, where a citizen marries a non-citizen typically for payment, without them having the intention of living together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/sham-marriage-bishops UK government Web site: Bishops act to tackle sham marriages - New UK Border Agency approved guidance for clergy should help prevent weddings for visas, 11 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Naturalization]]. States normally grant citizenship to people who have entered the country legally and been granted permit to stay, or been granted [[political asylum]], and also lived there for a specified period. In some countries, naturalization is subject to conditions which may include passing a test demonstrating reasonable knowledge of the language or way of life of the host country, good conduct (no serious criminal record) and moral character (such as drunkenness, or gambling), vowing allegiance to their new state or its ruler and renouncing their prior citizenship. Some states allow [[dual citizenship]] and do not require naturalized citizens to formally renounce any other citizenship.
* Citizenship by investment or [[Economic Citizenship]]. Wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. Whilst legitimate and usually limited in quota, the schemes are controversial. Costs for citizenship by investment range from as little as $100,000 (£74,900) to as much as €2.5m (£2.19m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluded categories. In the past there have been exclusions on entitlement to citizenship on grounds such as skin color, ethnicity, sex, and free status (not being a [[slave]]). Most of these exclusions no longer apply in most places. Modern examples include some [[Arab countries]] which rarely grant citizenship to non-Muslims, e.g. [[Qatar]] is known for granting citizenship to foreign athletes, but they all have to profess the [[Islamic]] faith in order to receive citizenship. The United States grants citizenship to those born as a result of reproductive technologies, and internationally adopted children born after February 27, 1983. Some exclusions still persist for internationally adopted children born before February 27, 1983 even though their parents meet citizenship criteria.

==History==
{{Main article|History of citizenship}}

===Polis===
{{Main article|Polis}}
Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for humanity, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Citizenship has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="tws2Y17"/&gt; The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might "really have worked" only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician [[Solon]] made reforms in the early Athenian state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12&gt;{{Cite book

Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui&gt;{{Cite book

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]
Slavery permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens (πολίτης ''politēs'' &lt; πόλις 'city') had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves, and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s).&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: "To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!" This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas===
In the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small-scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, as it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Civis romanus sum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long",&lt;ref name=twsffujfk&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn =1-4025-8360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Rome offered relatively generous terms to its captives, including chances for lesser forms of citizenship.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; If Greek citizenship was an "emancipation from the world of things",{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35}} the Roman sense increasingly reflected the fact that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. One historian explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1998{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; A citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} The law itself was a kind of bond uniting people.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

===Middle Ages===
During the European [[Middle Ages]], citizenship was usually associated with cities and towns, and applied mainly to middle class folk. Titles such as [[Burgher (title)|burgher]], [[grand burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[bourgeoisie]] denoted political affiliation and identity in relation to a particular locality, as well as membership in a mercantile or trading class; thus, individuals of respectable means and socioeconomic status were interchangeable with citizens.

During this era, members of the [[nobility]] had a range of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), though political upheavals and reforms, beginning most prominently with the [[French Revolution]], abolished privileges and created an egalitarian concept of citizenship.

===Renaissance===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Subject (monarchy)]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Subject}}
During the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

===Modern times===
The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

From 1790 until the mid-twentieth century, United States law used racial criteria to establish citizenship rights and regulate who was eligible to become a naturalized citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/04/news/mn-9708|title=A History of U.S. Citizenship|last=|first=|date=July 4, 1997|website=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naturalization Act of 1790|The Naturalization Act of 1790]], the first law in U.S. history to establish rules for citizenship and naturalization, barred citizenship to all people who were not of European descent, stating that "any alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=226|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Library of Congress|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under early U.S. laws, African Americans were not eligible for citizenship. In 1857, these laws were upheld in the US Supreme Court case [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]], which ruled that "a free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States," and that "the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393#writing-USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZO|title=Scott v. Sandford|last=|first=|date=1857|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the abolition of slavery following the [[American Civil War]] that African Americans were granted citizenship rights. [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], ratified on July 9, 1868, stated that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=Constitution of the United States: Amendment XIV|last=|first=|date=1868|website=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] would extend the right to become a naturalized citizen to include "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870|title=Naturalization Act of 1870|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikisource|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the gains made by African Americans after the Civil War, Native Americans, Asians, and others not considered "free white persons" were still denied the ability to become citizens. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] explicitly denied naturalization rights to all people of Chinese origin, while subsequent acts passed by the US Congress, such as laws in [[Naturalization Act of 1906|1906]], [[Immigration Act of 1917|1917]], and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]], would include clauses that denied immigration and naturalization rights to people based on broadly defined racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1917_immigration_act.html|title=1917 Immigration Act|last=|first=|date=|website=US Immigration Legislation Online|publisher=University of Washington-Bothell Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court cases such as [[Ozawa v. United States]] (1922) and [[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind|U.S. v. Bhagat Singh Thind]] (1923), would later clarify the meaning of the phrase "free white persons," ruling that ethnically Japanese, Indian, and other non-European people were not "white persons", and were therefore ineligible for naturalization under U.S. law.

Native Americans were not granted full US citizenship until the passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924. However, even well into the 1960s some state laws prevented Native Americans from exercising their full rights as citizens, such as the right to vote. In 1962, New Mexico became the last state to enfranchise Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/voters9.html|title=Elections: Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] that the racial and gender restrictions for naturalization were explicitly abolished. However, the act still contained restrictions regarding who was eligible for US citizenship, and retained a national quota system which limited the number of visas given to immigrants based on their national origin, to be fixed "at a rate of one-sixth of one percent of each nationality's population in the United States in 1920".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act|title=The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The McCarran-Walter Act)|last=|first=|date=|website=The Office of the Historian|publisher=U.S. Department of State|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] that these immigration quota systems were drastically altered in favor of a less discriminatory system.

====Soviet Union====
The [[Russian Constitution of 1918|1918 constitution of revolutionary Russia]] granted citizenship to any foreigners who were living within Russia, so long as they were "engaged in work and [belonged] to the working class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article2.htm|title=1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

====National Socialism====

[[National Socialism]] or "Nazism", the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which would have different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on males of German (or so-called "Aryan") heritage who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. The Reich Citizenship Law of 1935 established [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial criteria for citizenship in the German Reich]], and because of this law Jews and others who could not prove "German" racial heritage were stripped of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw3.html|title=The Nuremberg Laws: The Reich Citizenship Law (September 15, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. All women were to be conferred "subject" status upon birth, and could only obtain "citizen" status if they worked independently or if they married a German citizen (see [[women in Nazi Germany]]).

The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights.

{{Quote|text="The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

The young boy or girl who is of German nationality and is a subject of the German State is bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every German. Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him conscious of his race and a member of the folk-community. Then he has to fulfil all those requirements laid down by the State in regard to physical training after he has left school; and finally he enters the army. The training in the army is of a general kind. It must be given to each individual German and will render him competent to fulfil the physical and mental requirements of military service. The rights of citizenship shall be conferred on every young man whose health and character have been certified as good, after having completed his period of military service. This act of inauguration in citizenship shall be a solemn ceremony.

And the diploma conferring the rights of citizenship will be preserved by the young man as the most precious testimonial of his whole life. It entitles him to exercise all the rights of a citizen and to enjoy all the privileges attached thereto. For the State must draw a sharp line of distinction between those who, as members of the nation, are the foundation and the support of its existence and greatness, and those who are domiciled in the State simply as earners of their livelihood there.

On the occasion of conferring a diploma of citizenship the new citizen must take a solemn oath of loyalty to the national community and the State. This diploma must be a bond which unites together all the various classes and sections of the nation. It shall be a greater honour to be a citizen of this Reich, even as a street-sweeper, than to be the King of a foreign State.

The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State.

The German girl is a subject of the State but will become a citizen when she marries. At the same time those women who earn their livelihood independently have the right to acquire citizenship if they are German subjects."|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

==Different senses==
[[File:Citizenship contrasting views.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one. For further information, see [[History of citizenship#Competing senses of citizenship|History of citizenship]].]]
Citizenship status, under [[social contract]] theory, carries with it both [[Social rights (social contract theory)|rights]] and [[duties]]. In this sense, citizenship was described as "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.

How citizenship is understood depends on the person making the determination. The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government. 

Citizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a "broad bond" linking "a person with the state" and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15&gt;{{Cite book

According to this viewpoint, citizens are sovereign, morally autonomous beings with duties to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack,&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; but are essentially passive politically,&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; and their primary focus is on economic betterment.

* The civic-republican or sometimes classical or civic humanist conception of citizenship emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active process, not a passive state or legal marker.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; It is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]]. Citizenship means being active in government affairs.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; According to one view, most people today live as citizens according to the liberal-individualist conception but wished they lived more according to the civic-republican ideal.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; An ideal citizen is one who exhibits "good civic behavior".&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Free citizens and a republic government are "mutually interrelated."&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship suggested a commitment to "duty and civic virtue".&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

Scholars suggest that the concept of citizenship contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between [[duties]] and [[rights]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Another is a question about what is the proper balance between political citizenship versus social citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship can be seen as a special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; According to [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arthur Stinchcombe]], citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14&gt;{{Cite book

==International==
{{See also|Global citizenship}}
Some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''"The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy"''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===European Union===
{{Main article|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: the consolidated version.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An agreement known as the amended [[EC Treaty]]&lt;ref name="Rome" /&gt; established certain minimal rights for European Union citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guaranteed a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provided a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the European Union citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States&lt;ref&gt;Note: Articles 39, 43, 49 EC.&lt;/ref&gt; which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », NATIONS, CULTURES ET ENTREPRISES EN EUROPE, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L'Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163-184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth===
The concept of "[[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth Citizenship]]" has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]] or [[Prime Minister]].

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic, Ireland is generally treated as if it were still a member. Legislation often specifically provides for equal treatment between Commonwealth countries and Ireland and refers to "Commonwealth countries and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/246/pdfs/uksi_20050246_en.pdf The Commonwealth Countries and Ireland (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's citizens are not classified as foreign nationals in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.

==Subnational==
Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as "citizens" of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The United States has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New Jersey]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.

==Education==
{{Main article|Citizenship education (subject)}}
"[[Active citizenship]]" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, citizenship education is taught in schools, as an academic subject in some countries. By the time children reach secondary education there is an emphasis on such unconventional subjects to be included in academic curriculum. While the diagram on citizenship to the right is rather facile and depth-less, it is simplified to explain the general model of citizenship that is taught to many secondary school pupils. The idea behind this model within education is to instill in young pupils that their actions (i.e. their [[Election|vote]]) affect collective citizenship and thus in turn them.

===Republic of Ireland===
It is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics &amp; Society' is being developed by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.
*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web

*Citizenship is not taught as a discrete subject in [[Scotland|Scottish]] schools, but is a cross-curricular strand of the Curriculum for Excellence. However they do teach a subject called "Modern Studies" which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/
|title=Modern Studies Association
|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Citizenship is taught as a standalone subject in all state [[Education in Northern Ireland|schools in Northern Ireland]] and most other schools in some forms from year 8 to 10 prior to [[GCSEs]]. Components of Citizenship are then also incorporated into GCSE courses such as 'Learning for Life and Work'.

==Criticism of citizenship education in schools==
There are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg &amp; Guérin"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A. &amp; L.J.F. Guérin (2016) Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education. ''Critical Review'', DOI: 10.1080/08913811.2016.1191191 [https://www.academia.edu/28404527/Questioning_Participation_and_Solidarity_as_Goals_of_Citizenship_Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, some educationalists argue that merely teaching children about the theory of citizenship is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflect democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say in decision making. They suggest that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Greenberg+Education+in+America+-+A+View+from+Sudbury+Valley+%22Democracy+Must+be+Experienced+to+be+Learned%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned."] Retrieved 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some educationalists relate this criticism to John Dewey (see critical comments on this interpretation of Dewey: Van der Ploeg, 2016).&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A.

{{refimprove|date=September 2010}}
'''Consequentialist justifications of the state''' are philosophical arguments which contend that the [[State (polity)|state]] is justified by the good results it produces. 

[[The justification of the state]] is the source of legitimate authority for the state or [[government]]. Typically, a justification of the state explains why the state should exist, and what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do. Consequentialist justifications of the state focus on the results that are achieved when certain institutions are put in place. They are based on [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] theories such as [[utilitarianism]]. Consequentialism is sometimes confused with utilitarianism, but utilitarianism is only one member of a broad family of consequentialist theories.

Consequentialist theories usually maintain that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on whether the results of the action are desirable. They are frequently contrasted to [[deontology|deontological]] theories of morality, which typically hold that certain actions are either forbidden or wrong ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''.

== Justifications of state ==

In law and political theory, a state or [[sovereignty|sovereign]] is an institution that legitimates a particular government. Sometimes arguments about legitimacy have a mystical side to them, as when kings claim [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. 

Different political philosophies have distinct opinions concerning the state as a domestic organization [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopolizing force]].

As an example, consequentialists might observe that the state builds bridges. They would ask whether those bridges would have been built in the absence of the state and whether those bridges are valued by those who use them. If the bridges would not have otherwise been built and they are valuable to those who use them, then the existence of the state is justified.

A philosopher who doubts or denies the legitimacy of the state might respond by questioning the ethical premise, saying for example that the workers who built that bridge were exploited by the government that ordered it built, and/or by the investors in the private contractors who profited. The philosopher might have a [[deontology|deontological]] theory of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].

Alternatively, a skeptic might concede that the bridge is a good consequence but contend that even on consequentialist grounds the argument fails. He might argue that an even better bridge might have been built under [[Anarchism|anarchist]] conditions. This counter-argument raises the issue of [[opportunity cost]] and the whole issue becomes an exercise in economic reasoning.

'''Cosmopolitanism''' is the [[ideology]] that all [[human being]]s belong to a single [[community]], based on a shared morality. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a '''cosmopolitan''' or '''cosmopolite'''.

A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive [[morality]], a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing [[Belief|beliefs]] (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Anthony Appiah |first1 = Kwame
 |year = 1997
 |title = Cosmopolitan Patriots
 |url = |journal = Critical Inquiry
 |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |pages = 617–39
 |doi=10.1086/448846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various cities and locales, past or present, have been or are identified as "cosmopolitan"; that does not necessarily mean that all or most of their inhabitants consciously embrace the above philosophy.  Rather, locales may be called "cosmopolitan" simply because people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious background live in proximity and interact with each other.

In origin, cosmopolitanism suggests the establishment of a cosmo [[polis]] or ‘[[world state]]’ that would embrace all humanity.  Cosmopolitanism has come to stand for peace and harmony among nations, founded upon understanding, tolerance and interdependence.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the {{lang-grc|κοσμοπολίτης}}, or ''kosmopolitês'', formed from "{{lang|grc|κόσμος}}", ''[[cosmos|kosmos]]'', i.e. "world", "universe", or "cosmos", and {{lang|grc|πολίτης}}, "''politês''", i.e. "citizen" or "[one] of a city". Contemporary usage defines the term as "citizen of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kosmopoli/ths|κοσμοπολίτης|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cosmopolitan|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolitan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}} {{cite web|title=cosmopolite|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cosmopolite&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of "citizen of the world". However, as Appiah points out, "world" in the original sense meant "cosmos" or "universe", not earth or globe as current use assumes.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', W.W. Norton, New York, 2006, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite Article = Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philosophical==
{{further|Global justice|Moral universalism}}

===Philosophical roots===
[[File:Waterhouse-Diogenes.jpg|thumb|Diogenes]]
Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] movement in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|The Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]'', Book VI, passage 63; online text [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=D.+L.+6.2.63&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0257 in Greek] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D2 in English] at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity in at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being "dwells [...] in two communities&amp;nbsp;– the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The ''Journal of Political Philosophy'' Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt;
A common way to understand [[Stoicism|Stoic]] cosmopolitanism is through [[Hierocles (Stoic)|Hierocles]]' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of "affinity" or "endearment" towards others, which the Stoics termed [[Oikeiôsis]]. The task of world citizens becomes then to "draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth".&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Modern cosmopolitan thinkers===
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Immanuel Kant]], who argued for a ''ius cosmopoliticum'']]
In his 1795 essay ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] stages a ''ius cosmopoliticum'' (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to protect people from war, and morally grounds this cosmopolitan right by the principle of universal hospitality. Kant there claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" (see [[common heritage of humanity]]) would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy – Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical concepts of [[Emmanuel Levinas]], on ethics, and [[Jacques Derrida]], on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no "universal moral law," only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth.  The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response.

For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake.

Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized "cosmopolitanism",&lt;ref name=Bennington1997&gt;

| text  = There is a tradition of cosmopolitanism, and if we had time we could study this tradition, which comes to us from, on the one hand, Greek thought with the Stoics, who have a concept of the 'citizen of the world'. You also have St. Paul in the Christian tradition, also a certain call for a citizen of the world as, precisely, a brother. St. Paul says that we are all brothers, that is sons of God, so we are not foreigners, we belong to the world as citizens of the world; and it is this tradition that we could follow up until Kant for instance, in whose concept of cosmopolitanism we find the conditions for hospitality. But in the concept of the cosmopolitical in Kant there are a number of conditions: first of all you should, of course, welcome the stranger, the foreigner, to the extent that he is a citizen of another country, that you grant him the right to visit and not to stay, and there are a number of other conditions that I can't summarise here quickly, but this concept of the cosmopolitical which is very novel, very worthy of respect (and I think cosmopolitanism is a very good thing), is a very limited concept.

A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the [[Second World War]].  As a reaction to the [[Holocaust]] and the other massacres, the concept of [[crimes against humanity]] became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Ulrich (2006). The Cosmopolitan Vision, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical cosmopolitans are [[Moral universalism|moral universalists]]: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Appiah, Kwame Anthony (2006), Cosmopolitanism. Ethics in a World of Strangers, London: Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging [[planetary phase of civilization]], creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as [[global citizen]]s and possible formation of a [[global citizens movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/PDFFINALS/15Movements.pdf Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement]'', paper #15, and ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt; These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of [[global warming]] and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], or [[International Criminal Court]]; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic [[globalization]]; the emergence of global [[NGO]]s and [[Transnationalism|transnational]] social movements, such as the [[World Social Forum]]; and so on. [[Globalization]], a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place.

===Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers===
{{Cleanup section|Numbers with no known meaning appear in several places|date=February 2012}}
A number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual.

[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] discusses what he calls "Interbeing" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; "Interbeing" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of [[Buddhist]] teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996/&gt;{{rp|88}} He further describes what he calls "Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication.&lt;ref name=NhatHanh1996&gt;{{cite book |first=Thich |last=Nhất Hạnh |author-link=Thich Nhat Hanh |editor-last=Kotler |editor-first=Arnold |others=Illustrations by Mayumi Oda |title=Being Peace |orig-year=1987 |location=Berkeley |publisher=Parallax |date=1996 |oclc=36745774 |isbn=978-0-938077-97-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–95}} Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people.

Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In ''[[Scared Sacred]]'', [[Velcrow Ripper]] takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Ripper, Velcrow (director) |title=Scared Sacred |medium=Film |publisher=National Filmboard of Canada |date=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Planet", [[Paul Gilroy]] explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what [[Judith Butler]] calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise.

In ''Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers'', [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] notices something important about how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, "at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion" for valuing others?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence |location=New York |publisher=Verso |date=2004 |oclc=803802111 |isbn=978-1-84467-005-5 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that "methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|67}} This estrangement entails a "process of exposure to otherness" in order to foster "the irreducible value of diversity within sameness."&lt;ref name="Gilroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilroy |first=Paul |chapter=The Planet |title=After Empire: Multiculture or Postcolonial Melancholia |location=London |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |oclc=56454095 |isbn=978-0-415-34307-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness.

For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In "The Planet", Gilroy describes the cases of [[Tom Hurndall]] and [[Rachel Corrie]];&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents) and their stories might serve as affirmations of familiarity, rather than models of estrangement. Gilroy’s model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy’s theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar.&lt;ref name="Gilroy"/&gt;

[[The Venus Project]], an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by [[Jacque Fresco]], works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other.

Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Frantz Fanon]], in ''The Wretched of the Earth'', observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became "manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fanon |first=Frantz |author-link=Frantz Fanon |date=1963 |chapter=The Pitfalls of National Consciousness |title=The Wretched of the Earth |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |translator-first=Constance |translator-last=Farrington |pages=148–205 |oclc=817260777 |isbn=978-0-8021-5083-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}} When "third world" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself.

Further, Mahmood Mamdani in ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim'' suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and [[Christianity]] to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mamdani |first=Mahmood |title=Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |date=2004 |oclc=53315228 |isbn=978-0-375-42285-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Appiah |first=Kwame Anthony |author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |chapter=Kindness to Strangers |title=Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=W.

Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken [[nationalism]] and the framework of the sovereign [[nation-state]] for granted. Now, with the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it  is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. [[Jesús Mosterín]] analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2008 |title=La cultura de la libertad |location=Madrid |publisher=Espasa-Calpe |isbn=978-84-670-2697-9 |oclc=693823808 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the [[Internet]] provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods.  Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mosterín |first=Jesús |author-link=Jesús Mosterín |date=2005 |title=A World without Nation States |journal=Acta Institutionis Philosophiae et Aestheticae |volume=23 |pages=55–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion.

Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, [[Charles Blattberg]] has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be "rooted," by which he means based upon a "global patriotism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |date=5 April 2012 |editor1-last=Kymlicka |editor1-first=Will |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=Kathryn |ssrn=2034932 |chapter=We Are All Compatriots |title=Rooted Cosmopolitanism |location=Vancouver |publisher=UBC Press |via=Social Science Research Network |isbn=978-0-7748-2262-6 |oclc=886376838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares the [[John Searle]]'s opposition to multiculturalism with [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s celebration of it. She uses [[Richard Rorty]] as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nicholson |first=Carol |date=1998 |title=Three Views of Philosophy and Multiculturalism: Searle, Rorty, and Taylor |conference=Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy |url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Educ/EducNich.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference on "Philosophy in a Multicultural Context", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism.  He develops [[Bruno Latour]]'s conception of the philosopher as public diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Winther |first=Rasmus Grønfeldt |date=2012 |title=Free to Universalize or Bound by Culture?

==Political and sociological==

[[Emile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile. "Individualism and Individuals": Originally published as "L'individualisme et les intellectuels," Revue bleue, 4e serie, 10 (1898): 7-13. Translated by Mark Traugott. Article accessed: https://www.scribd.com/document/85771137/Durkheim-Individualism-and-the-Intellectuals&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to [[John Rawls]]' [[political liberalism]], which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.&lt;ref&gt;See Cladis, Mark. 'A Communitarian Defense of Liberalism: Emile Durkheim and Contemporary Social Theory' (Stanford University Press: Stanford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ulrich Beck]] (May 15, 1944 – January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional [[nation-state]] politics.  Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the [[nation-state]] model.  Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players.

It is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered [[hegemony|hegemonic]] at best and [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] at worst.  Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations:
* "Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the future"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of nature"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of the object"
* "Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities"

A number of philosophers, including [[Emmanuel Levinas]], have introduced the concept of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will—the ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. Totality and Infinity. An Essay on Exteriority. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;

During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of [[Moral universalism|universalism]] – namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stojadinović|first1=Mladen|title=UNIVERSALISM REVIVED: NEEDS-BASED COSMOPOLITANISM AS A FOUNDATION OF GLOBAL DEMOCRACY|journal=Facta Universitatis, Series: Philosophy, Sociology, Psychology and History|date=2014|volume=13|pages=78–80|url=http://casopisi.junis.ni.ac.rs/index.php/FUPhilSocPsyHist/article/view/331/333|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

As an example, [[Judith Butler]] discusses a Western discourse of "human" in ''Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence''. Butler works through the idea of "human" and notes that "human" has been "naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all "human" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places.&lt;ref name="Barua Circulating"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barua, Maan |year=2013 |title=Circulating Elephants: Unpacking the Geographies of a Cosmopolitan Animal |journal= Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |volume=0 |issue= |url=https://www.academia.edu/5089770|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is reiterated in [[Sunera Thobani]]'s "Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada," where she discusses a discourse in which [[Muslim people]] fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a "good Muslim" is one who has been Westernized and a "bad Muslim" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully "human" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]].

According to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of [[civil society]] actors such as Non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of [[Global Citizen]] will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a [[global citizens movement]] would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as [[global warming]]) and [[subsidiarity]] (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 GTI Paper Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211182551/http://www.gtinitiative.org/default.asp?action=43 |date=2008-02-11 }} see ''[[Global politics|Global Politics]] and Institutions'', paper #3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniele Archibugi]] proposes a renewed model for [[Global Citizen|global citizenship]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html   The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward a Cosmopolitan Democracy], Princeton University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], Debating Cosmopolitics, London: Verso, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one definition, "The counterintelligence state is characterized by the presence of a large, elite force acting as a watchdog of a security defined as broadly that the state must maintain an enormous vigilance and enforcement apparatus... This apparatus is not accountable to the public and enjoys immense police powers... Whether the civilian government is able to [[Civilian control of the military|control the security bodies]] is an open question; indeed ''the civilian government is so penetrated by the apparatus that there is no clear distinction between the two.''"&lt;ref name="Waller"/&gt;

==Soviet Union==
There was a massive security apparatus in the [[Soviet Union]] to prevent any opposition, and "every facet of daily life fell into the [[KGB]]'s domain."&lt;ref name="Waller"/&gt;

Undercover staff of the KGB included three major categories:
:(a) the [[Active reserve (KGB)|active reserve]],
:(b) the "trusted contacts" (or "reliable people"), and
:(c) "civilian informers" (or "secret helpers").

The "active reserve" included KGB [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] with a military rank who worked undercover. "Trusted contacts" were high placed [[civilian]]s who collaborated with the KGB without signing any official working agreements, such as directors of personnel departments at various institutions, academics, deans, or writers and actors.&lt;ref name="Albats"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]] and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. ''The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia—Past, Present, and Future.'' 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}, pages 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Informers were citizens secretly recruited by the KGB, sometimes using forceful recruitment methods, such as [[blackmail]]. The precise number of people from various categories remains unknown, but one of the estimates was 11 million "informers" in the Soviet Union, or one out of every eighteen adult citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Pringle. ''Andropov's Counterintelligence State'', International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, 13:2, 193–203, page 196, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
A "Law on Foreign Intelligence" adopted in August 1992 provided conditions for penetration by former KGB officers to all levels of the government and economy, since it stipulated that "career personnel may occupy positions in ministries, departments, establishments, enterprises and organizations in accordance with the requirements of this law without compromising their association with foreign intelligence agencies."&lt;ref name="Anderson1"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600601079958 The HUMINT Offensive from Putin's Chekist State] Anderson, Julie (2007), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 20:2, 258–316&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Russian banker, "All big companies have to put people from the security services on the board of directors... and we know that when [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka]] calls, they have to answer them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2008-28-3.cfm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A current FSB colonel explained that "We must make sure that companies don't make decisions that are not in the interest of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9682621|title=The making of a neo-KGB state|date=2007-08-23|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-24|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181050/http://finrosforum.fi/?p=513|title=FINROSFORUM - Home|date=2011-07-20|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olga Kryshtanovskaya]], director of the Moscow-based [[Center for the Study of Elites]], has found in the beginning of the 2000s that up to 78% of 1,016 leading political figures in [[post-Soviet Russia]] have served previously in organizations affiliated with the KGB or FSB.&lt;ref name="Finn"/&gt; She said: "If in the Soviet period and the first post-Soviet period, the KGB and FSB people were mainly involved in security issues, now half are still involved in security but the other half are involved in [[business]], [[political parties]], [[NGO]]s, regional governments, even culture... They started to use all political institutions."&lt;ref name="Finn"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121101434.html ''In Russia, A Secretive Force Widens''], by P. Finn, Washington Post, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"Under [[Russian Federation]] President and former career foreign intelligence officer [[Vladimir Putin]], an '[[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB State]]' composed of [[Chekism|chekists]] has been established and is consolidating its hold on the country. Its closest partners are [[organized crime|organized criminals]]. In a world marked by a [[globalization|globalized economy]] and information infrastructure, and with [[List of designated terrorist organizations|transnational terrorism groups]] utilizing all available means to achieve their goals and further their interests, [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian intelligence]] collaboration with these elements is potentially disastrous.", said politologist [[Julie Anderson (politologist)|Julie Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600601079958 The HUMINT Offensive from Putin's Chekist State] Anderson, Julie (2007), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 20:2, 258 – 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Takeover"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600500483699 The Chekist Takeover of the Russian State], Anderson, Julie (2006), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 19:2, 237 – 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] compared the takeover of Russian state by [[silovik]]s with an imaginary scenario of [[Gestapo]] coming to power in Germany after [[World War II]]. He noted a fundamental difference between the [[secret police]] and ordinary [[political parties]], even totalitarian ones, such as the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]]. The Russian secret police organizations use various violent [[active measures]]. Hence, according to Felstinsky, they killed [[Alexander Litvinenko]] and directed [[Russian apartment bombings]] and other terrorism acts in Russia to frighten the civilian population and achieve their political objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-span.org/video/?200627-1/book-discussion-blowing-russia-secret-plot Blowing Up Russia: The Secret Plot to Bring Back KGB Terror] Historian [[Yuri Felshtinsky]] explains his views on the nature of Putinism on [[C-SPAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former KGB officer [[Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy]] shares similar ideas. When asked "How many people in Russia work in [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]]?", he replied: "Whole country. FSB owns everything, including [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] and even own Church, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]... Putin managed to create new [[social system]] in Russia" [http://www.voanews.com/russian/archive/2007-02/2007-02-02-voa3.cfm].

"Vladimir Putin's Russia is a new phenomenon in Europe: a state defined and dominated by former and active-duty security and intelligence officers. Not even [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], or the [[Soviet Union]] – all undoubtedly much worse creations than Putins government – were as top-heavy with intelligence talent", said intelligence expert Marc Gerecht.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.25917/pub_detail.asp A Rogue Intelligence State?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">The '''delegate model of representation''' is a model of a [[representative democracy]]. In this model, [[Electoral district|constituents]] elect their representatives as [[delegates]] for their [[constituency]]. These delegates act only as a mouthpiece for the wishes of their constituency/ state, and have no [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] from the constituency only the autonomy to vote for the actual representatives of the state. This model does not provide representatives the luxury of acting in their own conscience. Essentially, the representative acts as the voice of those who are (literally) not present.

This model was contested by [[Edmund Burke]] (1729-1797), an Irish philosopher, who also created the [[trustee model of representation]].

In practice, a deliberative referendum includes a variety of institutional design features. These include using a [[citizens' jury]] to set referendum questions and educate the public, further public education via mandatory interactive tutorials before voting, and focusing referendums on broad values rather than technicalities.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2017) ″The Deliberative Case for Constitutional Referenda ″ Election Journal p. 214-215. &lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors note how legal regulation can also aid referendum deliberation.&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal p.523.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One deliberative referendum method increasingly in use is the [[Citizens' Initiative Review]]; this is a randomly-selected body, similar to a citizen's jury, convened specifically to deliberate on a ballot [[initiative]] or [[referendum]] that voters in the same jurisdiction (such as a city, state, province, or country) will later vote on.&lt;ref&gt; John Gastil and Robert Richards, ‘Making Direct Democracy Deliberative Through Random Assemblies’ (2013) 41(2) , Politics &amp; Society  (2013) 41 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Constitutional]] deliberative referendums can ″provide citizens with a meaningful say in determining the most fundamental constitutional decisions that affect their lives.″&lt;ref&gt; Tierney, Stephen (2013) ″Using Electoral Law to Construct a Deliberative Referendum Moving Beyond the Democratic Paradox″ 12(4) Election Law Journal p.510.&lt;/ref&gt; Voter deliberation is significant here as the referendum result could change the state’s political status or impact the enjoyment of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Ron (2013) ″Deliberative Voting: Realising Constitutional Referendum Democracy″ Public Law p.559.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demeny voting''' is the provision of a [[suffrage|political voice]] for children by allowing parents or [[legal guardian|guardians]] to vote on their behalf. The term was coined by [[Warren C. Sanderson]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, 2007. A Near Electoral Majority of Penioners. Population and Development Review, Volume 33, Issue 3, pages 543–554, September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a Demeny [[voting system]], each parent would cast a [[proxy vote]], worth half a vote, for each of their [[dependant|dependent]] children, thus allowing for a split vote if the parents' political views differ. Once children reach the minimum [[voting age]], their parents would no longer vote on their behalf.

==History==

Demeny voting is named after [[demography|demographer]] [[Paul Demeny]], who came up with the idea in 1986. Demeny argued that children "should not be left disenfranchised for some 18 years: let custodial parents exercise the children's voting rights until they come of age". Demeny's motivation behind proposing such a system was to "make the political system more responsive to the young generation's interests" and was part of a broader set of policy proposals aimed at combating the low [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;Demeny, P. 1986 "Pronatalist Policies in Low-Fertility Countries: Patterns, Performance and Prospects," ''Population and Development Review'', vol. 12 (supplement): 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea, however, is older than Demeny's idea; it was regularly discussed in France in the 1920s and was almost adopted by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Parijs, Philippe van, 1999 ,"The Disenfranchisement of the Elderly, and Other Attempts to Secure Intergenerational Justice", ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 27,: 292–333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinrichs, Karl 2002"&gt;Hinrichs, Karl, 2002,"Do the Old Exploit the Young? Is Enfranchising Children a Good Idea?", ''Archives of European Sociology'' Vol 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the idea was even first discussed in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Rupprecht, I. "Das Wahlrecht für Kinder", Baden-Baden 2012, Nomos-Verlag: 26–32&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and the 1980s lawyers and political scientists began a discussion which is still going on. In
2003 and 2008 the German parliament had votes on whether to introduce a ''Kinderwahlrecht'' (which is the term in German), but the proposals were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geo.de/GEOlino/nachrichten/1471.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Hermann started a comprehensive economic approach to discuss it.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, U. "Ökonomische Analyse eines Kinderwahlrechts", Saarbrücken, südwestdeutscher verlag, http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/receive/FUDISS_thesis_000000021349?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieter Vanhuysse (head of research and Deputy Director at the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research, Vienna) argued in 2013 that in Austria, where there are relatively strong pro-elderly policies, that "the time is ripe for at least opening a clear-headed and empirically informed democratic debate about the radical idea of giving each parent one half extra vote, to be used on behalf of each under-age child until that child reaches legal voting age".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.centre.org/data/1381844857_65713.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan has discussed Demeny voting as a possible answer to its aging population, which gives disproportionate voice to the elderly as a result of their increasing numbers. This follows the publication of a paper by [[Reiko Aoki]] of the Centre for Intergenerational Studies at [[Hitotsubashi University]] and [[Rhema Vaithianathan]] of the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hitpiecis/435.htm EconPapers: Is Demeny Voting the Answer to Low Fertility in Japan?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March 2011, the Centre for Intergenerational Studies at Hitotsubashi University hosted a conference on Demeny voting.&lt;ref&gt;http://cis.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/Japanese/society/conferences-shoushika.html&lt;/ref&gt; Aoki and Vaithianathan have also conducted a number of surveys on voter attitude to Demeny Voting and found that a considerable percentage of respondents would cast their children's vote differently to their own. In July 2013, Nikkei in Japan wrote a major editorial supporting the idea as part of a debate on constitutional reform in Japan.

In [[Hungary]], the ruling [[coalition government|coalition]] has been advocating Demeny voting, but admitted in April 2011 that it probably won't come into practice for some time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20110404/fidesz-official-urges-body-set-up-to-examine-giving-extra-vote-to-families/ Politics.hu, April 4th, 2011: "Fidesz official urges body set up to examine giving extra vote to families"] Retrieved 2011-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Demeny discussed the idea on a CBC interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/video/news/audioplayer.html?clipid=1887678996 CBC interview with Paul Demeny]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Miles Corak from the University of Ottawa has also written a blog on the idea and promoted it in Canada. He suggests that it is supported on a humanitarian basis since the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children be given civil and political rights. He suggests that given the evidence that households where mothers control the purse-strings spend more on their children, it is mothers who ought to be given the proxy vote until the child comes of age. Professor Corak's thesis has been taken up by journalist [[Chrystia Freeland]] .

==Advantages==
Aoki and Vaithianathan argue that Demeny voting is justified because it reduces [[gerontocracy]]. They calculate that Demeny voting in Japan would increase the parent voting bloc to 37% and lower the over-55-year-old voter-bloc to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hitpiecis/435.htm EconPapers: Is Demeny Voting the Answer to Low Fertility in Japan?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stefan Olsson]]&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, Stefan, 2008,"Children's Suffrage: A Critique of the Importance of Voters' Knowledge for the Well-Being of Democracy", The International Journal of Children's Rights'', vol. 16,: 55–76.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "the delegation of the children's right to vote is not any stranger than when adults delegate political authority to their elected representative. After the election, the representatives have the right to make use of this authority." (page 71). He suggests that delegating a child's authority to the parent is perfectly reasonable. Olsson also argues that there are other areas where parents are delegated authority such as what the child eats, where he goes to school, and children are regularly represented in a court of law by parents.  He says that "Arguing that parents cannot act as their children's representative because they might abuse their position becomes absurd in comparison to all the other [[parental rights|powers]] parents already have over their children." (page 72).

It has been suggested it would make it harder for elderly voters to vote in governments that borrow money for [[social security]] but which will only be paid back by future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://the-diplomat.com/tokyo-notes/2011/01/15/should-parents-vote-for-kids/ Should Parents Vote for Kids? | Tokyo Notes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It may ensure that the needs of children, such as education, [[childcare]], and healthcare, are better taken into account.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoContent/N/neucesifo/CONFERENCES/SC_CONF_2008/Fertility%20and%20Public%20Policy/Sanderson_fpp08_neu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It could also make governments more [[ecology|ecologically]] conscious as younger people will be more affected by poor [[environmental policy]] than older voters. Finally, extending the vote to children may increase their involvement in politics, encouraging children to grow up and be more active citizens.

==Disadvantages==
Opponents see Demeny voting as a violation of a fundamental normative principle of democracy: '[[one_man, one_vote|one person, one vote]]'. They point to the fact that children below the minimum voting age can hold different political opinions and thus prefer different parties to their parents.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} There is no evidence that parents would split their votes. Instead, they would have plural votes for the same party they prefer (and have formerly preferred).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some writers argue that, like marrying or making a will, voting is an exercise of the informed will and cannot legitimately be done by proxy.&lt;ref name="Hinrichs, Karl 2002"/&gt; Others have argued that with the right to vote comes other obligations of [[citizenship]], such as [[military service]]. Since children do not have those obligations, it is argued they should also not have such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Schrag, F., 2004,  "Children and Democracy: Theory and Practice Politics", ''Philosophy and Economics'' Vol 3&lt;/ref&gt; Some people worry that the power of older votes will be diluted and the interests of children might be prioritised above those of the elderly.

Yet others have argued that lowering the [[voting age]] to 13 or 14 or lower would be more beneficial, as many children are able to express complex opinions at that age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2009/07/against-demeny-voting.html No Right Turn: Against Demeny voting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2007/06/lowering-voting-age.html No Right Turn: Lowering the voting age&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars advocate a 'flexible voting age' building on the willingness of minors to participate in elections.&lt;ref&gt;5.	Tremmel, Jörg / Wilhelm, James (2015): Democracy or Epistocracy? Age as a Criterion of Voter Eligibility. In: Tremmel, Jörg / Mason, Antony / Dimitrijoski, Igor / Godli, Petter (eds.): Youth Quotas in Ageing Societies. Dordrecht, NL: Springer, pp. 125–147.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘flexible voting age’ proposal contains a need for adolescents to register in voting lists and so differs from proposals that come under the name of ‘voting from birth on’ or ‘voting age zero’. It takes into account that infants, small children and many younger adolescents will have no interest in political participation. 

[[Jon Elster]] has argued that if the justification for Demeny is on the basis of consequences, then said consequences should be voted on, rather than changing the voting demographic. His argument is that to advance Demeny voting on the grounds that it leads to desirable consequences is pointless, since it will be blocked by exactly those groups who will block the desired consequences (e.g. raising the pension age).&lt;ref&gt;Elster, Jon (1986) "Comment on van der Veen and Van Parijs", ''Theory and Society'' pp.709- 722&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|Frederick Lugard's book on [[indirect rule]]|Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard#The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa}}
A '''dual mandate''' is the practice in which elected officials serve in more than one elected or other public position simultaneously. This practice is sometimes known as '''double jobbing''' in Britain and ''cumul des mandats'' in France; not to be confused with '''double dipping''' in the United States, i.e. being employed by and receiving a retirement pension from the same public authority at the same time.  Thus, if someone who is already [[mayor]] of a town or city councillor becomes elected as [[Member of parliament|MP]] or [[senator]] at the national or state legislature and retains both positions, this is a dual mandate.

Dual mandates are sometimes prohibited by law. For example, in [[federal state]]s, federal office holders are often not permitted to hold state office. In states with a [[presidential system]] of government, membership of the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[legislature]], or the [[judiciary]] generally disqualifies a person from simultaneously holding office in either of the other two bodies. In states with [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures, one usually cannot simultaneously be a member of both houses. The holder of one office who wins election or appointment to another where a dual mandate is prohibited must either resign the former office or refuse the new one.

==European Parliament==
A member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a [[Member State of the European Union|member state]].&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Council Decision of 25 June 2002 and 23 September 2002 amending the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, annexed to Decision 76/787/ECSC, EEC, Euratom|work=Official Journal of the European Communities |volume=L 283 |date=2002-10-21 |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002D0772:EN:NOT |pages=1–4 |id=2002/772/EC,Euratom}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dates from a 2002 [[European Union decision]], which came into effect at the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European elections]] in most member states,&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt; at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 national election]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]],&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt; and at the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009 European elections]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt;

Originally, MEPs were nominated by national parliamentarians from among their own membership.&lt;ref name="manning74"&gt;{{cite news |title= The problems of dual parliamentary loyalty|first=Maurice|last=Manning|work=The Irish Times |date=February 27, 1975|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[European Parliament election, 1979|the first direct elections in 1979]], the dual mandate was discussed.&lt;ref name="manning74"/&gt; Some advocated banning it, arguing that MEPs who were national MPs were often absent from one assembly in order to attend the other&lt;ref name="manning74"/&gt; (indeed, the early death of [[Peter Michael Kirk]] was blamed by his [[election agent]] on overwork resulting from his dual mandate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Dual Mandate |work=The Irish Times |date=April 21, 1977|page=9|quote=Sir Peter's own election agent has stated categorically that he died from pressure and overwork caused by his dual mandate as an MP at Westminster and a member in Strasbourg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Others claimed that members with a dual mandate enhanced communication between national and European assemblies.&lt;ref name="manning74"/&gt; There was a particular interest in the dual mandate question in Denmark: [[Eurosceptic]] [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democrats]] supported a compulsory dual mandate, to ensure that the state's MEPs expressed the same views as the national legislature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/european_parliament/ep.htm|title=An analysis of the European Parliament’s electoral arrangement(s).

==Australia==
Dual mandates are rare in [[Australia]]. It is illegal to be a member of any [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state parliament]] and the [[Australian parliament]] simultaneously. A member of a state parliament seeking federal office must resign before seeking election to the [[Government of Australia|Federal]] [[Parliament]]. It is possible but unusual to be a member of a [[local government]] and another [[parliament]].

In 2004 [[Clover Moore]] became the [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[member for Sydney]] in the [[NSW Parliament]] without resigning as [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]]. The issue of Moore holding both positions had brought the issue to the forefront in Australia and led the premier of [[New South Wales]] in 2012 to propose a new law, dubbed in the media as the "Get Clover bill", which banned this dual mandate. The proposed law was adopted and in September 2012 Moore resigned her NSW seat soon after she was reelected as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/northern-territory/8916-clover-sadly-farewells-nsw-parliament.html |title=The latest entertainment news for Australia’s LGBTIQ community |publisher=Gay News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922144157/http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/northern-territory/8916-clover-sadly-farewells-nsw-parliament.html |archivedate=2012-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
As in neighboring France, the culture of dual mandates is very strong in Belgium and that country currently has one of the highest percentage of dual mandate holders (MPs, aldermen, municipal councilors) in the world. During the 2003–2009 period, 87.3% of members of the Walloon (French-speaking) Parliament held dual mandates, followed by 86,5% in the Flemish (Dutch-speaking) Parliament, 82,0% in the Chamber of Representatives (the Federal lower house) and 68.9% in the Senate. During that same period, 76.5% of all European Parliament MPs from Belgium held dual mandates.

More than one fifth of all Belgian MPs were mayor at the same time with, by far, by the highest proportion (40%) to be found in the Walloon Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Gert-Jan Put and Ine Vanlangenakker, "The extent of multiple office-holding in Belgium (2003-2009). An exploration of the underlying reasons." PhD Thesis, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (2010), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada dual mandates are rare and are frequently barred by legislation at the federal, provincial, or territorial level. At the federal level, section 39 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]] prevents a [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] from being elected as a [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of Parliament]]; similarly, s. 65(c) of the [[Canada Elections Act]] makes members of provincial or territorial legislatures ineligible to be candidates to the House of Commons. At the provincial level, the situation varies from one province to another.

In other circumstances, an elected official almost always resigns their first post when elected to another. Dual representation has occurred occasionally when the member was elected to a second office shortly before their other term of office was due to expire anyway and whereby the short time frame would not merit the cost of a special [[by-election]]. In 1996, for example, [[Jenny Kwan]] continued to be a [[Vancouver]] city councillor after being elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|provincial legislature]]. The British Columbia legislature had debated a "Dual Office Prohibition Act" which failed to pass [[second reading]].

In the first few years after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, however, double mandates were common. In the first [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], there were fifteen Members of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] from [[Quebec]] who simultaneously held seats in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], including the [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau]]. There were also four members of Parliament from [[Ontario]] who also held seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], including the first two [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]]s, [[John Sandfield Macdonald]] and [[Edward Blake]].  Other prominent federal politicians with double mandates included [[George-Étienne Cartier]], [[Christopher Dunkin]], [[Hector Langevin]], the second [[Premier of British Columbia]] [[Amor de Cosmos]], and two members from [[Manitoba]], [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] and [[Pierre Delorme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ex Uno Plures: Federal-Provincial Relations in Canada, 1867-1896 |author=Garth Stevenson |page=330 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-7735-1633-6 |edition=paperback |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mbJIbrmfgUC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example is that of the ''de facto'' leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], who ran for both federal and provincial seats in 1867.  Brown lost both elections, and soon thereafter began campaigning for the prohibition of double mandates.

The double mandate was prohibited from the start in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]; it was abolished in Ontario in 1872, in Manitoba in 1873, and in 1873 the federal parliament passed a law against it; Quebec passed its own law abolishing it in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The French-Canadian idea of Confederation, 1864-1900 |author=A.

The House of Commons and Its Members |isbn=2-89461-378-4 |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dual mandates within a province remained legal. From 1867 to 1985, 305 mayors were also members of the Quebec legislative assembly (MLA). The two best-known cases were those of S.N. Parent who was simultaneously mayor of Quebec City (1894-1906), MLA and Premier of Quebec (1900-1905). Longtime Montreal Mayor Camilien Houde (1928–32, 1938–40) was also simultaneously MLA for a total of 2 /1/2 years during his mandates as mayor. However that type of dual mandate had virtually ceased when laws adopted in 1978 and 1980 prohibited MLAs from holding any local mandate.

==Finland==
It is common for the MPs of the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]] to hold a mandate as a member of their local municipal council as well. 79 percent of MPs elected to parliament in 2011 were also municipal council members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunnat.net/fi/Kuntaliitto/media/tiedotteet/2011/04/Sivut/eduskunnassa-yha-enemman-kunnanvaltuutettuja.aspx |title=Eduskunnassa yhä enemmän kunnanvaltuutettuja |publisher=Kunnat.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
[[File:2014-11-22 16-21-42 commemoration.jpg|thumb|The MP-mayor of Belfort and the senator-mayor of Beaucourt at a ceremony in 2014]]
The ''' ''cumul des mandats'' ''' ({{IPA-fr|kymyl dɛ mɑ̃da|lang}}, {{literally}} ''accumulation of mandates'') is a common practice in the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1958–present).&lt;ref&gt;At the time Pierre Mauroy was prime minister (1981–84), he kept his job as [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Lille, one of France's largest cities, without anyone objecting. France has had legions of députés-maires, sénateurs-maires and ministres-maires.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of simultaneously holding two or more elective offices at different levels of government — local, regional, national and European — as mayors, MPs, senators, Members of the European Parliament, and [[President of the General Council]] in their home regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gidea |first=Robert |year=2002 |title=France since 1945 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-219246-9 |page=240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, officials hold as many as four positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadeau |first=Jean-Benoît |author2=Julie Barlow |title=Sixty million Frenchmen can't be wrong: why we love France but not the French |year= 2003|publisher=Sourcebooks |location=Naperville, Illinois |isbn=1-4022-0045-5 |page=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While officials may not be elected to more than one office at the same level (such as being both an MP and a senator), they may hold offices in any combination at the municipal, departmental, regional, national and European levels. The ''cumul des mandats'' is controversial in France, being accused of fostering [[absenteeism]] and [[cronyism]].

Several laws to limit the practice have been introduced in recent decades. By far the most coveted local mandate is that of mayor, traditionally a highly prestigious function in France.

A hotly debated law to prohibit all dual mandates, to take effect in 2017, was adopted in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2013/07/05/cumul-des-mandats-l-assemblee-adopte-la-principale-mesure-du-projet-de-loi_3442825_823448.html|title=Non-cumul des mandats : le projet de loi adopté à l'Assemblée|date=5 July 2013|publisher=|via=Le Monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the adoption of the law, former President Sarkozy and other members of the opposition UMP party have declared that if elected in 2017, their party would revise or even revoke that law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2014/01/19/01002-20140119ARTFIG00186-la-droite-table-sur-l-abrogation-du-texte-en-cas-de-retour-au-pouvoir-en-2017.php|title=Cumul des mandats : la droite reviendrait sur le texte en cas de retour au pouvoir|first=Jean-Baptiste|last=Garat|date=19 January 2014|publisher=|via=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfmtv.com/politique/sarkozy-pret-a-supprimer-la-loi-sur-le-non-cumul-des-mandats-940126.html|title=Sarkozy prêt à supprimer la loi sur le non-cumul des mandats?|first=|last=BFMTV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Socialist Party MPs and senators have also expressed their unease with the law imposed by President Hollande and might welcome a review of the law. In the meantime, the ubiquitous 'député-maire' (MP and mayor) and 'sénateur-maire' are still familiar figures of the French political scene.

===Conditions regarding multiple mandates in France===
*The [[President of France|President of the Republic]] cannot hold any other office during their tenure.

'''Multiple mandates at the legislative level'''

Parliamentary mandates are incompatible with each other:

*Member of the [[National Assembly of France]]
*Member of the [[Senate of France]]
*Member of the [[European Parliament]]

A member from one of the above assemblies can not combine its mandate with more than one of the following mandates :

*Member, vice-president or president of a [[General councils (France)|General Council]]
*Member, vice-president or president of a [[Regional councils of France|Regional Council]]
*Councillor, deputy-mayor, or [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of a commune of more than 3,500 inhabitants
*Councillor of Paris (The "[[Council of Paris]]" is at the same level a municipal council and a general council, because Paris has a special status, Municipality and [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] at the same level)
*Councillor in the [[Corsican Assembly]] (Corse has a regional special status)

Exceptions: They can hold a third office in a town of less than 3,500 inhabitants.

They may also hold a third office as a councillor, vice-president or president of an [[Urban communities in France|Urban community]], an [[Agglomeration communities in France|Agglomeration community]] or a ''[[Communauté de communes]]'', as these terms are elected by indirect universal suffrage, by municipal councils from among the councillors.

For example, a member of the National Assembly has the right to be general/regional councillor or [[President of the Regional Council (France)|President]] of a regional/general council. They cannot hold a third office unless they are the mayor, deputy mayor or municipal councillor of a city of less than 3,500 inhabitants.

In 2008, 85% of members of parliament held multiple posts &lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/world/europe/13france.html?_r=1&amp;th=&amp;emc=th&amp;pagewanted=all French Cabinet Position Not Enough? Then Try Mayor], [[The New York Times]], January 13, 2008. Accessed March 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the June 2012 legislative elections, it was still the case that 85% of all National Assembly members (438 deputies out of 577) held a double mandate (often as mayor of a mid- to large-size city) and 33 have four mandates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nom * |url=http://bigbrowser.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/07/11/pastiche-le-cumul-des-mandats-une-addiction-qui-se-soigne/ |title=PASTICHE – Le cumul des mandats, une addiction qui se soigne &amp;#124; Big Browser |publisher=Bigbrowser.blog.lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, out of 348 senators, 152 are also mayors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nom * |url=http://jeandumonteil.blog.lemonde.fr/2012/05/14/lengagement-de-la-fin-du-cumul-des-mandats-sera-t-il-tenu/ |title=L’engagement de la fin du cumul des mandats sera-t-il tenu ? &amp;#124; EXTRATERRITORIAL |publisher=Jeandumonteil.blog.lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The accumulation of local mandates'''

They cannot have more than two local mandates.

The following mandates are incompatible each other:

*[[Mayor (France)|Mayor]]
*[[President of the General Council]]
*[[President of the Regional Council (France)|President of the Regional Council]]

For example, an elected official cannot be mayor and President of the Regional Council. However, all other local mandates are cumulative. A mayor can also be a general councillor and a president of a Regional Council can also be deputy-mayor of a city.

Exceptions are the same as those for parliamentarians (Cities of less than 3,500 inhabitants and the intercommunalities)

'''The accumulation of mandates and governmental functions''' 
[[File:2014-11-22 16-21-42 commemoration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Damien Meslot|MP-mayor]] of Belfort and the {{ill|Cédric Perrin|fr|Cédric Perrin (homme politique)}} senator-mayor of Beaucourt at a ceremony in 2014]]
A member of the French government cannot be a member of any assembly. However, he may retain any local mandate he or she holds. A cabinet minister can exercise a maximum of two local mandates in addition to his or her government function.

For example, the Prime Minister, a Minister or Secretary of State can be [[Mayor (France)|mayor]], or President of a general, regional or intercommunal council or sit in one of these assemblies.

Currently, over two-thirds of the members of the French government are engaged in one or two more local mandates.

===Purpose and frequency===
{{POV section|date=March 2015}}
The rationales for holding multiple offices are varied. Holding a seat in the Senate, National Assembly, or European Parliament gives local [[Mayor (France)|mayors]] a valuable method of tapping funds to develop their home cities and regions.&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"&gt;Gildea, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; It also can give opportunities to curry favor with other important officials, with opportunities at each level.&lt;ref name="Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56"&gt;Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Salaries for positions can be combined (to a point) as well.&lt;ref name="Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56"/&gt;  For politicians with national ambitions, retaining a position in a local town can give them a down-to-earth aura that can appeal to voters. These advantages have made politicians very wary of reducing the practice of the ''cumul'' with legislation despite other moves to end perceptions of favoritism and corruption among politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Gildea, pg. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been common practice in France since the [[French Third Republic]] (1870). But there are also many cases of "cumul" before this period, for example, the writer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was a member from 1839 to 1851. In 1849 he was appointed Foreign Affairs minister, and at the same time he was elected [[President of the General Council]] of [[Manche]] from 1849 to 1851 (councillor from 1842 to 1852).

There are several reasons for this phenomenon, and one of them is that France has a long tradition of centralization, compared to countries such as Germany, Italy, and Spain. Local governments have less power and skills than that the "Länder" of Germany, or "Autonomous Communities" of Spain. The local mandates in France are less important than in other countries, and therefore politicians have more time to devote to a parliamentary mandate.

The ''cumul'' is a widespread practice and has grown much more prevalent in modern France. In 1946, 36 percent of deputies in the National Assembly held an additional office.&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"/&gt;  By 1956, this number had already increased to 42 percent&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"/&gt; and by 1970, 70 percent of deputies held an additional elected office; in 1988, 96 percent did.&lt;ref name="Gildea, pg. 240"/&gt;

Many of the most prominent politicians in France make use or have made use of the ''cumul''. [[Jacques Chirac]] served as [[List of mayors of Paris|Mayor]] of [[Paris]] between 1977 and 1995.  During this same time, Chirac also served as a deputy in the National Assembly from [[Corrèze]], briefly as [[Member of the European Parliament]], and even as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] between 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56"/&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Pierre Bérégovoy]] served concurrently as mayor of [[Nevers]] and deputy of [[Nièvre]] in the mid-1980s.

====An example : the accumulation of four electoral mandates====
[[File:20110300 Emboîtement et cumul des mandats d'Yves Jégo.PNG|thumb|[[Yves Jégo]]'s four mandates, between March 2010 and July 2011.]]
According to French law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/elections/les_elections_en_france/cumul-mandats "French Interior Ministry"] "Le cumul des mandats électoraux" (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; against accumulation of electoral mandates, [[Yves Jégo]] should have resigned from one of the following mandates before the 21st of April 2010 (one month after the Regional elections) :
*Member of the [[National Assembly of France]] for [[Seine-et-Marne]]
*Regional councillor of [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]]
*[[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne]]
But giving as a pretext a legal complaint from the [[Front National (France)|Front National]]'s candidates, he hold the three of them during more than one year, plus his local mandate of president of the « [[communauté de communes]] des deux fleuves » ([[Communauté de communes des Deux Fleuves|CC2F]]).

===Recent and current status of ''cumul'' in the French government===
[[Lionel Jospin]] (Prime Minister from 1997 to 2002) imposed on his government ministers an unwritten rule of having no local office. For example, [[Catherine Trautmann]] stepped down as [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Strasbourg]] (while remaining a member of the city council) to become [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]]; conversely, [[Martine Aubry]] stepped down from the [[Minister of Labour (France)|Ministry of Labour]] when elected Mayor of [[Lille]] in 2001. This rule was more or less upheld by [[Jacques Chirac]] during the governments of [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]] for the 2002-2007 term, with a few notable exceptions ([[Jean-François Copé]] was mayor of [[Meaux]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]  was [[President of the General Council|President]] of the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] General Council); for instance, [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] had to step down from the [[Toulouse]] mayorship upon joining the government.

{{As of|2007}}, no such rule was stated for the [[François Fillon]] government: [[Alain Juppé]], former Minister for Development was mayor of [[Bordeaux]], and was defeated in his National Assembly constituency (a third cumulative mandate) by 50.9% to 49.1% of the votes by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate. Additionally, [[Hervé Morin]], the [[Minister of Defense (France)|Minister of Defense]], is mayor of [[Épaignes]], and [[Éric Besson]], Minister of Immigration and National Identity, is the mayor of [[Donzère]].

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, dual mandate is common for members of the territory's [[Legislative Council]], who serve concurrently as members of one of the territory's eighteen district councils. Before the abolition of the two municipal councils in the territory in 1999, it was common for politicians to serve concurrently at all three levels.

==Ireland==
The instability caused by the close result of the [[Irish general election, 1981|1981 general election]] was exacerbated by the number of government [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s who also served as MEPs and for whom the opposition refused [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pairing]] when they were abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connor|first1=Tom|last2=O'Halloran|first2=Anthony|last3=Pattison|first3=Seamus|title=Politics in a Changing Ireland 1960-2007: A Tribute to Seamus Pattison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujipx7kGF70C&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=28 November 2014|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|isbn=9781904541691|page=49|chapter=A career politician}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to further elections [[Irish general election, February 1982|in February 1982]] and [[Irish general election, November 1982|again in November]].

In 1991, [[Government of Ireland|cabinet ministers]] and [[Minister of State (Ireland)|junior ministers]] were prohibited from serving as [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local councillors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1991/act/11/section/13/enacted/en/html#sec13|title=Local Government Act, 1991, Section 13|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prohibition was extended to other [[Oireachtas]] members by the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003, an amendment to the [[Local Government Act 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/print.html#sec2 |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=June 2, 2003 |series=[[Irish Statute Book]] |chapter=§2 Amendment of Principal Act — insertion of new section 13A |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to include it in the 2001 Act failed after a rebellion by [[Fianna Fáil]] [[backbencher]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/no-political-will-to-rock-the-cosy-boat-that-is-the-seanad-502066.html |title=No political will to rock the cosy boat that is the Seanad |last=Murphy |first=John A |date=14 July 2002|work=Sunday Independent |quote=The councillor lobby which stymied Noel Dempsey's plans to end the dual mandate |accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2003 Act passed after a compensation package was agreed for those losing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/news-in-brief-215369.html |title=Local government needs independent 'fiscal autonomy' |last=Geaney |first=Louise |date=2 June 2003 |work=Irish Independent |quote=The Local Government Bill 2000 proposed to abolish the dual mandate but the Act dropped the idea, only for it to be re-introduced — with a handy €12,800 sweetener — in 2003. |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 Act prohibited being a member of multiple county or city councils, or multiple [[List of cities, boroughs and towns in the Republic of Ireland|town council]]s, or both a town and city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0037/sec0014.html |title=Local Government Act 2001 |year=2001 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§14.

The 2003 Act provided that a candidate elected simultaneously to a forbidden combination of local councils has three days to choose which seat to take up, with the other or others then being considered vacant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/sec0006.html |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=June 2, 2003 |series=Irish Statute Book |chapter=§6 Amendment of Local Elections Regulations 1995 |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]] abolished town councils and instead subdivided most counties into [[municipal district (Ireland)|municipal district]]s; the county council's members are the district councillors for all districts within the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/LocalGovernmentReform/|title=Local Government Reform|year=2014|publisher=Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0001/sec0019.html|title=Local Government Reform Act 2014, Section 19|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Irish republican party [[Sinn Féin]] held the office as a [[Member of The Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] within the respective houses. [[Martin McGuinness]], former [[Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]] held the office as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and simultaneously was a MP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. However, in 2012 Sinn Féin committed to end dual jobbing; this resulted in McGuinness' resignation from the House of Commons in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20871049|title=Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness resigns as Mid-Ulster MP|date=2012-12-30|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/martin-mcguinness-hands-in-his-resignation-for-mp-position-735995-Dec2012/|title=Martin McGuinness resigns as MP|last=Croffey|first=Amy|newspaper=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Per the [[Spanish Constitution]], legislators in the [[List of Spanish regional legislatures|regional assemblies]] of the [[Autonomous Communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]] are barred from being elected to a seat in the [[Congress of Deputies]], the lower house of the [[Cortes Generales]]. More precisely, regional legislators can run for the seat, but if elected they must choose between the regional and national parliaments. Nevertheless, members of lower tiers of the Spanish decentralized structure, such as provincial councillors or members of local councils, including mayors, can and have held seats in the Congress of Deputies. The rule barring regional legislators does not apply to the upper house of the Cortes, the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]]: in fact, regional legislatures are entitled to appoint a varying number of members from their ranks to the Senate, according to the population of the region. Currently, the Autonomous Communities appoint 56 Senators, the other 208 being directly elected in [[Elections in Spain|general elections]].

==United Kingdom==
At the EU level, prior to the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]], there were a small number of [[Member of the European Parliament|members of the European Parliament]] who were also members of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahl2004/downloads/decisionandact.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708163144/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahl2004/downloads/decisionandact.pdf |date=July 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now European law that a member of the [[European Parliament]] (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a [[Member State of the European Union|member state]].&lt;ref name="eu32002D0772"/&gt; This, with regard to the United Kingdom, therefore applies to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as the constituent bodies forming that member state's legislature. As it is impossible to disclaim a [[life peerage]], it has been ruled that peers (who sit as members of the House of Lords) must take a "leave of absence" from the Lords in order to be an MEP; this is also the procedure for when a peer is the UK's [[European Commissioner]], which has in recent times usually been the case.

There have been members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] also holding seats in the devolved bodies in [[Scottish Parliament|Scotland]], [[National Assembly for Wales|Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland]]. The November 2009 report by the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] into [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|the controversy surrounding MPs' expenses]] noted that "double jobbing" was "unusually ingrained in the political culture" of Northern Ireland, where 16 of 18 MPs were MLAs, compared to one Scottish MP being an MSP ([[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]]), and no Welsh MPs being AMs.&lt;ref name="CSPL"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/Library/MP_expenses_main_report.pdf#page=97 |title=MPs' expenses and allowances; Supporting Parliament, safeguarding the taxpayer |date=November 2009 |accessdate=15 April 2010 |author=Committee on Standards in Public Life |series=House of Commons papers 2009 |volume=7724 |others=Chaired by Sir [[Christopher Kelly (civil servant)|Christopher Kelly]] |page=95 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214231245/http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/Library/MP_expenses_main_report.pdf#page=97 |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee recommended that Westminster ban multiple mandates from the 2011 assembly elections.&lt;ref name="CSPL"/&gt; Parties in Northern Ireland agreed to a ban from the 2015 elections.&lt;ref name="CSPL"/&gt; The ability to dual mandate between the Assembly of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons (or the Irish [[Dáil Éireann]]) ended as from the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016]] following the [[Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/13/section/3|title=Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wales Act 2014]] also applied a similar restriction on the National Assembly for Wales (in that its members cannot also be members of the House of Commons) as from the assembly election in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2014-15/wales.html|title=Wales Act 2014 — UK Parliament|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing in UK law prohibits a member of the House of Commons or the House of Lords from being simultaneously a mayor, council leader, or other locally elected official. Thus [[Ken Livingstone]] remained MP for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] until the dissolution of Parliament despite his election as [[Mayor of London]] a year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2010/jan/05/boris-johnson-london-mayor-mp-simultaneously|title=Boris Johnson: simultaneous Mayor and MP?|first=Dave|last=Hill|date=5 January 2010|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Johnson]] resigned his seat as MP for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] on being elected mayor in 2008, but became an MP again in 2015, a year prior to the end of his second term as mayor (he did not seek a third term). [[Sadiq Khan]], elected as the Labour mayor in the [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 election]], resigned his seat as MP for [[Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Tooting]] soon after his election to the mayoralty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34218390|title=Sadiq Khan wins Labour London mayoral selection|date=11 September 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous members of the [[House of Lords]] however hold positions in local government.

At a lower level, it is common for people to hold seats on both [[administrative geography of the United Kingdom|a district council and a county council]]. Several MPs have also retained their council seats, most often until the expiration of their terms;&lt;!--John Hemming, for three years; Craig Whittaker, for one--&gt; [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] simultaneously held a council seat and a seat in Parliament between his election to Parliament in 1997 and his defeat in the local elections in 2014.

==United States==
''The term '''dual mandate''' is also applied to the twin objectives of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]: to control inflation and promote employment.''

The practice is banned by [[State constitution (United States)|the constitutions]] of many [[U.S. state]]s, but as of 1992 it was still legal in [[Connecticut]], [[Illinois]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]].  The [[U.S. Constitution]] prohibits members of the Senate or House from holding positions within the Executive Branch (Art. I, Sec. 6, cl. 2), and limits the president to his salary as chief executive, saying he may not "receive... any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them" (Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 7).

===Florida===
In April 1984, [[Governor of Florida]] [[Bob Graham]] received legislation that passed unanimously in both houses of the [[Florida Legislature]] that would forbid public officials from receiving retirement pay and regular pay simultaneously for the same position.&lt;ref&gt;via ''[[Associated Press]]''.

===Illinois===
In August 2008, [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] proposed legislation that would prohibit dual-office holding as part of changes to the state's ethics bill, stating that "dual government employment creates the potential for a conflict of interest because a legislator's duties to his or her constituents and his or her public employer are not always consistent." Critics, such as Representative [[Susana Mendoza]], called the actions "spite" on the part of the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Fusco, Chris.

===New Jersey===
Fulfilling a campaign pledge that he had made when first running for the [[New Jersey Legislature]], [[Jack Sinagra]] sponsored a bill passed by the [[New Jersey Senate]] in 1992 that would ban the practice. At the time that the legislation first passed, there were some twenty elected officials who served in the New Jersey Legislature and another elected office, including Assemblyman [[Bill Pascrell]], who was also mayor of [[Paterson, New Jersey]]; State Senator [[Ronald Rice]], who also served on the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] City Council; and Assemblyman [[John E. Rooney (politician)|John E. Rooney]], who was also mayor of [[Northvale, New Jersey|Northvale]]. These officials protested the proposed ban as interfering with the will of voters to elect officials as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;Strum, Charles.

{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=Concepts}}
"'''Dual Power'''" ({{lang-rus|Двоевластие|r=Dvoyevlastiye}}) was a term first used by [[Communism|communist]] [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870-1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described a situation in the wake of the [[February Revolution]], the first of two [[Russian Revolution]]s in that tumultuous year of [[1917]]. Two powers coexisted with each other and competed for legitimacy: the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] ([[workers councils]]), particularly the [[Petrograd Soviet]], and the continuing official state apparatus of the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] of democratic socialists.

Lenin argued that this essentially unstable situation constituted a unique opportunity for the Soviets and Bolsheviks to seize power by smashing the weak tottering Provisional Government and establishing themselves as the basis of a new form of state power.

This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent [[communist]]-led revolutions elsewhere in the world, including the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1949 led by [[Mao Zedong]] (1893-1976) after the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1931 and 1946-1949) and in [[eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]] (1939-1945), such as in [[Czechoslovakia]] where after three years of post-war agitation and occupation by the invading Russian [[Red Army]] finally overthrew a moderate government with the Communists seizing power in 1948.

== Background ==
After [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicated the throne, the resulting [[February Revolution]] led to the establishment of the Provisional Government and its counterpart, the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. The Provisional Government was composed of former State Duma representatives with approval from the Petrograd Soviet, whereas the Petrograd Soviet was made up of socialist leaders elected by a [[proletariat]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russian government moving from an [[autocracy]] to this system of "dual power" with the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet constantly vying for power, there was much confusion on how both could coexist and govern effectively.

In this confusion, the Provisional Government realized the Soviet had the people's trust and enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 59&lt;/ref&gt; In the hopes of appeasing the Soviet and keeping the support of the population, the Provisional Government launched several very bold liberal acts and promoted civil liberties through means of freedom of speech, press, and assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71-72&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other than strategic political motives, the Provisional Government understood that their power was illegitimate, due to the fact that they were not elected by the people. To solve the problem of illegitimacy, the Provisional Government was in the process of establishing the Constituent Assembly, whose members would be democratically elected by the people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Constituent Assembly would never come to be under the Provisional Government's rule, as the elections were set after the Bolsheviks seized power in the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 348&lt;/ref&gt;

After the February Revolution, Lenin published his April Theses and in it he expressed unhappiness with the February Revolution as he described it as a "Bourgeois Revolution".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Russian Revolution, 1861-1917|last=Wood|first=Alan|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed for the slogan "All Power to the Soviets". Lenin mentioned that a Proletariat Revolution is necessary, and expressed that he has no interest in cooperating with the Provisional Government or the other Soviet leaders who are willing to compromise. Other Soviet leadership were skeptical to Lenin's ideas since they were afraid that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were advocating for anarchism. Lenin also criticized the Petrograd Soviet for governing alongside the Provisional Government, and accused them of forgetting and abandoning socialist ideas and the proletariat revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Provisional Government ==
The [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]'s members primarily consisted of former [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] members under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s reign. Its members were mainly members of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] (known as the Kadets party), as the Kadets were the only formal political party functioning in the Provisional Government at its conception. The ideological and political ideas differed wildly throughout the party's leadership and members, but most were moderates, offering both liberal and conservative views at times.  The Kadets and the Provisional Government alike pushed for new policies including the release of political prisoners, a decree of freedom of press, cessation of the [[Okhrana]], abolition of the death penalty, and rights for minorities. The Provisional Government and the Kadets also wanted Russia to continue to be involved in [[World War I]], much to the dismay of the Soviets. Despite certain political ideas, the Kadets became slightly more conservative overall with the rise of left-wing parties and left-wing thought within both the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government realized that their power was not legitimate since they were former Duma members, and not elected by a general public. They knew that to be seen as a legitimate government body, they would need to be elected by the people, and they established the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] and scheduled popular elections to take place later in the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky]], a former member of the Fourth Duma and a chairmen of the Soviet Executive Committee and eventually the Prime Minister for the Provisional Government, was brought into the Provisional Government as a way to gain support from left-wing parties and the Petrograd Soviet. Kerensky was a moderate socialist, and believed that cooperation with the Provisional Government was necessary. Historian S.A. Smith explains that after the appointment of Kerensky "Thus was born 'dual power', an institutional arrangement under which the Provisional Government enjoyed formal authority, but where the Soviet Executive Committee had real power."&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government feared the Soviets immense growing power, and through this fear they tried to appease them as much as possible. When Kerensky became Prime Minister, he attempted to work with the Soviets including arming the Soviets and their followers during the [[Kornilov affair]]. The attempts of Kerensky would not last for a while, as the [[Bolsheviks]] did not believe in compromise and overthrew the Provisional Government in the October Revolution.

== Petrograd Soviet ==
The Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in Petrograd served as the voice of the smaller councils of deputies elected by commoners, specifically soldiers and workers. The Petrograd Soviet, therefore, could claim a much better understanding of the people's will, since it was composed of many orators whom the lower class population elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50418695|title=Voices of revolution : 1917|last=1953-|first=Steinberg, Mark D.,|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300101690|location=New Haven, CT|oclc=50418695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet was established after the February Revolution, composed of numerous socialist revolutionaries. However, its rapid rise to power meant the Petrograd Soviet did not have any legitimate claim to power, like its counterpart, the Provisional Government.

The workers and soldiers of Russia saw hope in the Petrograd soviets, and elected deputies to it en masse, causing it to gain membership at an alarming rate (1200 seats had been filled in a week). The Petrograd Soviet was seen as a benefactor that would bring them land, bread, and peace.

The Executive Committee was initially made up of Nikolai Ckheidze, Matvei Skobelev, and Alexander Kerensky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954018220|title=Russia in revolution : an empire in crisis, 1890 to 1928|last=1952-|first=Smith, S. A. (Stephen Anthony),|isbn=9780198734826|edition=First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=954018220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were socialists, but feared radicalism. To keep radical mentality from spreading and provoking a 'counter-revolutionary movement,' they chose to support the Provisional Government where necessary. This led to the uneasy balance of power called "Dual Power."

==July Days impact ==
The events of the [[July Days]] would solidify the issues of dual power within government between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet. Between the dates of July 3 and July 7 ([[Julian calendar|Julian Calendar]] date), a Bolshevik uprising, still disputed if intentional by Lenin, occurred. In what is seen as a "[[Grassroots|grass roots]]" uprising, workers and lower ranks of soldiers violently demonstrated in the streets, calling for the Soviet to take power over the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),124&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising was supported by the Bolshevik Military Organization and Petersburg Committee, who sent in more support, but the leaders of the party had less concrete opinions about the demonstration.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"&gt;Lewis Siegelbaum, "July Days" [subject essay], ''Seventeen Moments in Soviet History: An On-Line Archive of Primary Sources'', accessed November 5, 2017, http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1917-2/july-days/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky|Alexander Kerenksy]], head of the Provisional Government, led a crackdown on those involved with the events of the July Days and overthrow of the Provisional Government. The military was used to gather and arrest violent demonstrators, retake government buildings from Bolshevik forces, and dissolve military units that had participated in the attempted overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 156&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government also attempted to undermine Lenin and his party by revealing their investigation of his ties to Germany, Russia's enemy during World War I.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"/&gt; These combined actions would quell the Bolshevik uprising and support until August 1917 (Julian).

The reinstatement of the death penalty for soldiers, and Kerensky transferring the Provisional Government into the Winter Palace were among the actions that led to accusations of counterrevolutionary activity (reestablishment of autocratic government) by the Provisional Government.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Ferro, Marc (1971). "The Russian Soldier in 1917: Undisciplined, Patriotic, and Revolutionary". ''Slavic Review''. 30 (3): 483-512&lt;/ref&gt; A new kind of duality between the classes (proletariat and bourgeoisie) was a split noticeable not only in government, but also in everyday life for Russians. This led to increased tensions between both theaters, and made it difficult for groups to collaborate.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Kaiser, ''The Workers' Revolution in Russia, 1917: The View From Below'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Petrograd Soviet represented the Proletariat, while the Provisional Government members were part of the former State Duma, representing the old government under the tsar. This divide was also evident in the military, between rank-and-file soldiers and military officers.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; As World War I continued on, soldiers started to mutiny or to disobey orders from their superiors, while supporting the soviets, hoping to bring an end to Russia's involvement in the war.

== Bolshevik takeover ==
Although the Bolshevik party was largely put down after the events of the July Days, Lenin still believed that the group could gain power in government because of unsteadiness due to the dual power situation. In April he wrote that the time was not yet right for revolution, as the Petrograd Soviet was still involved and working with the Provisional Government, as well as stating, "we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets."&lt;ref&gt;V.I Lenin,"The Dual Power", ''Marxist Internet Archive'', 2005, accessed October 30, 2017, https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With the July Days seen as "Lenin's worst blunder,"&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),122&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was not necessarily his intention, the Bolsheviks were still not in place to take over the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet.

However, with the [[Kornilov affair]] of August 1917 (Julian-style date), the Bolsheviks regained both power in their party, but also with the masses. With Kornilov's soldiers moving towards the capital of Petrograd (modern day [[Saint Petersburg]]) and the Provisional Government, Kerensky had released many Bolshevik leaders arrested during the July Days and also provided arms in order for the Bolsheviks to defend the Provisional Government. By arming and calling on those who he had earlier punished, the Bolsheviks saw that they truly were gaining power in the government and Russian society. The Russian population lost faith in the Provisional Government because of how it handled Kornilov's coup, and many began supporting the Bolsheviks, with the group winning elections throughout Petrograd, especially in districts made up of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 171&lt;/ref&gt; This event, coupled with food shortages, the continuation of Russian involvement in World War I, and mass unemployment, worked in the Bolsheviks favor, turning people away from the government in charge&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),147&lt;/ref&gt; and toward the party that promised "Bread, Peace, Land."&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government during the [[October Revolution]], they were able to do so with little resistance. The Provisional Government realized that their power was limited at the point of takeover, as the Bolsheviks had been gaining supporters and had more revolutionaries. When the actual overthrow occurred between the days of October 25 and 26 (Julian), Bolsheviks first seized means of transportation and communication, such as roads, bridges, railways, and post offices.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin then went to the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies to present the overthrow of the Provisional Government and state authority by the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 173&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Winter Palace]] (at the time, the home of the Provisional Government) was seized without a causality the morning of the 26th, and the Congress had no choice but to approve Lenin's decree.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 175&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the period of dual power between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet came to a close.

== Strategy and ideological concepts ==
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
As the [[ideology|ideological]] monopoly of dominant [[institutions]] is broken and people increasingly rely on Alternative Institutions (AIs), those who benefited from existing arrangements may seek to dismantle their upstart competitors. At the same time, those who seek fundamental changes in society or who find the alternative ways of organizing it valuable may seek to enlarge and strengthen the alternative infrastructure. Counter institutions (XIs) are created both to defend the AIs and to promote their growth. These work to challenge and attack the [[status quo]] while creating, defending, and securing space for opposition and alternative institutions. They do this with everything from [[political protest]]s, to direct appropriation (of plantations, government buildings, factories, etc.) for the use of alternative institutions, to civil disobedience or armed resistance. The line between AIs and XIs is seldom entirely clear as many alternative institutions are also self-promoting or defending. Together the AIs and XIs form an alternative source of power in society which is "necessarily autonomous from, and competitive with, the dominant system, seeking to encroach upon the latter's domain, and, eventually, to replace it."&lt;ref name="Dominick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://left-liberty.net/?p=265|title=An Introduction to Dual Power Strategy|last=Dominick|first=Brian A.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process of building the alternative institutions and the ideology that supports them, the advantage of dual power is the creation of real, and not merely political, momentum towards the revolutionary transformation of society. Actual changes are ongoing, rather than postponed to a revolutionary moment, so needs unmet by the pre-existing order are being met during the struggle and no sector of society is told that its concerns can only be dealt with after victory is achieved. That is, creation of AIs and the political space for them has intrinsic benefits, apart from the advancement of the revolutionary project. Over the course of building AIs, the society at large is empowered, committed to change, and skilled in running society. Simultaneously, the credibility of a revolutionary vision is increased immensely by putting it into practice and by refining and improving it over time. It is also conceivable that factional splits between revolutionaries and reformers (and all the shades in between) could be reduced by having a common project that both find useful. Those forces that would be sent to suppress a revolutionary movement find themselves confronting people who have taken control over their own lives, rather than armed cadre attempting to impose a vision on the country, potentially obviating military conflict or at least reducing its severity. {{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

Successful dual-power rebellions end with the acceptance of the new social forms by much of the populace and the realization by the old rulers that they are no longer capable of using their systems of force against the revolutionary movement. This can occur because noncooperation has crippled the old structures of power, because too few people remain loyal to the old rulers to enforce their will, or because the rulers themselves undergo an ideological conversion. At this point, there is not general confusion. The disappearance of old leaders and structures of power is accommodated by the expansion of the alternative system. The alleged "necessity" for a revolutionary vanguard to guide the revolutionary impulse is shown to have no basis: because the people have already learned how to govern their own affairs, they need no tutelage from above. The possibility of co-option is minimized: "When the people recognize their true power, it cannot be taken away by rhetoric or […] imposition."&lt;ref name='Dominick'/&gt;

Dual power is a strategy, rather than an ideology, and it could plausibly be used to advance a variety of forms of social change. However, the advantages of the strategy make it most compatible with perspectives that emphasize the exercise of power at the community level, that seek to make the revolutionary movement accountable to the people, that see the capability to revision and transform society as common rather than rare, and that seek decentralized forms of power. Call this version of the strategy grassroots dual power, the bottom-up transformation and replacement of the mechanisms of society.{{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

[[Libertarian socialists]] have more recently appropriated the term to refer to the nonviolent strategy of achieving a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct [[participatory democracy]] to contest the existing power structures of state and capitalism. This does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual-power approach as "forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions — elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums — while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions."&lt;ref name='Yates'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagingnonviolence.org/feature/art-after-occupy/|first=Yates|last=McKee|title=Art after Occupy — climate justice, BDS and beyond|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as "counterpower" to differentiate it from the term's Leninist origins.

'''e-participation''' (''also written'' '''eParticipation''' ''and'' '''e-Participation''') is the term referring to "[[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]-supported participation in processes involved in government and governance".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Processes may concern administration, service delivery, decision making and policy making. E-participation is hence closely related to [[e-government]] and [[e-governance]] [[participation (decision making)|participation]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Jafarkarimi; A. T. H. Sim; R. Saadatdoost and J. M. Hee (2014). The Impact of ICT on Reinforcing Citizens’ Role in Government Decision Making, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Vol.4 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the term has emerged as citizen interests have received less attention than those of the service providers in e-government development. It also emerged as the need to distinguish between the roles of [[citizen]] and [[customer]] has become more pressing.

A more detailed definition sees e-participation as "the use of information and communication technologies to broaden and deepen political participation by enabling citizens to connect with one another and with their elected representatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintosh|first=Ann|date=2004|title=Characterizing E-Participation in Policy-Making|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.98.6150&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=In the Proceedings of the Thirty-Seventh Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition includes all stakeholders in democratic decision-making processes and not only citizen related top-down government initiatives. So e-participation can be seen as part of [[e-democracy]], the use of ICT by governments in general used by elected officials, media, political parties and interest groups, civil society organizations, international governmental organizations, or citizens/voters within any of the political processes of states/regions, nations, and local and global communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicus.net/articles/edempublicnetwork.html|title=E-Democracy, E-Governance and Public Net-Work|last=Clift|first=Steven|date=2003|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of e-participation processes results from the large number of different participation areas, involved stakeholders, levels of engagement, and stages in policy making. {{Harv|Fraser|2006|p=chapter 2}}.

== History ==
The term emanated in the early 2000s and draws generally on three developments.

# The general development in [[CSCW]] (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) and [[groupware]] directed towards collaborative environments to support human ICT-mediated interaction, both work-related and social.
# Developments in [[e-democracy]] since the late 1990s, where interest rapidly evolved from e-voting to several forms of ICT supported and enabled interaction between governments and citizens, including not only direct ones such as consultations, lobbying, [[internet petition|petitioning]] and polling but also ones pursued outside of government itself, including electioneering, campaigning, and community informatics. To a large extent, the institutional framework conditions of the chosen democratic model define at which part of the democratic processes participation is permitted (such as direct or representative democracy, or any intermediate forms).&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, Martin (2007). [http://www.martinhilbert.net/democracy.html "Digital Processes and Democratic Theory: Dynamics, risks and opportunities that arise when democratic institutions meet digital information and communication technologies]." open-access online book.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The development in [[e-government]] towards increasingly complex service delivery. Complex services require considerable interaction including searching, selecting options based on multiple criteria, calculating outcomes, notifications, inquiries, complaints, and many other activities. There are several ICT tools for such tasks, ranging from FAQs to call centres, but there is a need to coordinate all these into user-friendly but powerful toolsets for client-organization encounters. Because interaction in such contexts is complex, and because goals have to be reached, the arenas where it takes places becomes social arenas for ICT-supported participation.

== On the definition ==
The term 'participation' means taking part in joint activities for the purpose of reaching a common goal. This encompasses both trivial situations in which participation mainly has a technical meaning, ”doing things together”. For example, a [[football]] team needs 11 players, and dancing often requires two or more people acting in a coordinated manner. But participation, even in trivial situations, also has a goal-oriented aspect which means decision making and control are involved. Participation in [[political science]] and theory of [[management]] refers to direct public participation in political, economical or management decisions. The two are not completely separated but belong on a spectrum of complexity and context. When participation becomes complicated, decision making becomes necessary. Hence, any participatory process is potentially important for the rule system governing the activities. In terms of points 2 and 3 above, this means that when service processes become complex, the implementation of them will not be in all details based on political decisions but also on what is found to be practical.

Instead of taking in and accepting [[knowledge]] as is disseminated by the media and government, by participating, one becomes an active citizen and further contributes to a [[democratic society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Attention, and Other 21st-Century Social Media Literacies|url = http://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/10/attention-and-other-21stcentury-social-media-literacies|website = er.educause.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such practical doings become implemented in government (e)service systems, they will affect decision making, as many changes will later be hard to make simply because existing procedures are implemented in ICT systems and government [[Institution|agencies’]] procedures. There are many theories dealing with institutionalization, for example [[structuration theory]], [[institutional theory]], and [[actor-network theory]]. These theories all, in different ways, deal with how "ways of doing things" become established or rejected, and how those that become established increasingly affect the ways we "normally" do things.

== Models and tools ==
A number of tools and models have emerged as part of [[Web 2.0]] that can be used or inspire the design of architecture for e-participation. In particular, "the emergence of online communities oriented toward the creation of useful products suggests that it may be possible to design socially mediating technology that support public-government collaborations" {{Harv|Kriplean|Beschastnikh|Borning|McDonald|Zachry|2009}}.

This is generally defined as the enlisting of a group of humans to solve problems via the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electronic Government and Electronic Participation: Joint Proceedings of Ongoing Research, PhD Papers, Posters and Workshops of IFIP EGOV and EPart 2016|last=Scholl|first=H.J.|last2=Glassey|first2=O.|last3=Janssen|first3=M.F.W.H.A.|publisher=IOS Press|year=2016|isbn=9781614996699|location=Amsterdam|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that this platform is able to collect human resources from the most unlikely and remotest places, contributing to the general store of [[intellectual capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd Is Driving the Future of Business|last=Howe|first=Jeff|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780307396204|location=New York|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing can be applied in different stages of the [[Policy|policy-making]] process and these could transpire on the information, consultation, and active participation levels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Citizen E-Participation in Urban Governance: Crowdsourcing and Collaborative Creativity|last=Silva|first=Carlos|publisher=IGI Global|year=2013|isbn=9781466641709|location=Hershey, PA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the information level, there is a one-way relationship, wherein the participants receive information from the government. The consultation process entails a two-way interaction where citizens already provide their inputs, feedback, and reactions. Finally, active participation can refer to the deeper participatory involvement where citizens directly contribute in the formulation of policy content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This level of e-participation is increasingly being practiced through tools such as [[online petition]], e-referendum, e-panels, citizen e-juries, and [[participatory GIS]], among others.

== European eParticipation actions ==
=== European eParticipation Preparatory Action ===
'''eParticipation''' is the Preparatory Action{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/egovernment/implementation/prep_action/index_en.htm|title=eGovernment &amp; Digital Public Services|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; lasts{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} for three years (2006–2008). The EU is taking the lead in using online tools to improve the legislative process for its citizens. '''eParticipation''' which launched on January 1, 2007 will run as a series of linked projects which each contribute to a greater awareness and involvement by citizens in the legislation process from initial drafting to implementation at a regional and local level.

The individual projects will concentrate on ensuring that the legislative language and process is more transparent, understandable and accessible to citizens. In addition the projects emphasis on the communication of legislation will be used to enhance and grow citizens' involvement and contribution in the process of creating and implementing the legislation.

So far, 21 projects have been funded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu-participation.eu/ European eParticipation web]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Parliament]], national parliaments and local and regional authorities are actively involved. State-of-the-art ICT tools are being tested to facilitate the writing of legal texts, including translation into different languages, and the drafting of amendments as well as making the texts easier for non-specialists to find and understand. New digital technologies are also being used to give citizens easier access to information and more opportunity to influence decisions that affect their lives. A report {{Harv|Charalabidis|Koussouris|Kipenis|2009}}, which was published as a MOMENTUM white paper, highlights the major facts and figures of those projects while providing some initial policy recommendations for future use.

=== European eParticipation Actions ===
The [[European Commission]] has now launched a number of actions aiming at further advancing the work of supporting eParticipation.

Examples:
* [[Seventh Framework Programme|FP7]] : ICT Challenge 7 : Objective ICT-2009.7.3 ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/challenge7-governance_en.html|title=Archives - CORDIS - European Commission|author=|date=|website=cordis.europa.eu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] has launched some call in this area to finance researches. Currently the Integrated Program Future Policy Modelling (FUPOL) is the largest project in this domain. [http://www.fupol.eu FUPOL]
* [http://ec.europa.eu/cip/index_en.htm CIP] ICT Policy Support Programme (or ICT PSP). The European project has open a call in the programme CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Framework) on the Theme 3: ICT for government and governance

The '''Representative Office of Palestine''' in the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] ({{lang-ar|سفارة دولة فلسطين لدى ألمانيا}}) is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] in Germany. It is located in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.pna.ps/ar/archives/3272|title=Embassy of the State of Palestine in Germany|publisher=Ministry of foreign affairs of State of Palestine|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR, East Germany) recognized the State of Palestine in 1988 prior to the [[German reunification]] in 1990 with [[West Germany]] although the current government does not recognize the State of Palestine.

'''Far-Right subcultures''' refers to the symbolism, values and traits that hold relevance to various politically extreme right-wing groups and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patyi|first1=Peter|last2=Levická|first2=Jana|title=Attractiveness of Right Wing Oriented Movements and Subcultures in Modern Society of the Slovak Republic|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=August 2014|volume=143|pages=832–837|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Subkulturen {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/category/ressorts/wissen/woran-man-sie-erkennt/subkulturen&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=CCyrWMXaIcGIaLizrZAL|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of subcultures within far-right movements to distinguish: subcultural parasitism, subcultural creation around ideology and subcultures that are networking with far-right movements, as some football hooligans did with neo-nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/new-right-wing-alliance-of-neo-nazis-and-hooligans-appears-in-germany-a-1000953.html|title=Germany's New Right: The Unholy Alliance of Neo-Nazis and Football Hooligans - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subcultures created around or related to Nazi ideology ==
{{main|Nazi symbolism}}
{{see also|Nazi chic}}

== Subcultural Parasitism ==

[[Image:Neo-Nazi Skinhead.jpg|thumb|left|A neo-Nazi skinhead from Germany]]
Far-right ideologists try to infiltrate subcultures to spread their ideas amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: Rechtsextreme Jugendkultur http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/41740/jugendkultur&lt;/ref&gt; These attempts are defined as subcultural parasitism. The probably most known subculture, which got taken over by the far-right and neo-nazis is the [[Skinhead]] scene, which started originally in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Worley, Matthew, and Nigel Copsey. "White youth: the Far Right, Punk and British youth culture." JOMEC Journal 9 (2016): 27-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples for subculture parasitism: the [[Nipster]], infiltration of the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)]] by neo-nazis (Nazi Hipster), [[Nazi punk]], infiltration of the [[Heavy metal subculture]], known as [[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM/NSCH). Subcultures as the [[Goth subculture]] and the [[Hip Hop]] subculture got also infiltrated by far-right movements and ideologists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other examples for far-right or neo-Nazi subcultures: [[Esoteric Nazism]] and [[Nazi Satanism]].

[[File:Bussines berlin 2003.jpg|200px|thumb|British [[punk rock]] band [[The Business (band)|The Business]] performs in [[Berlin, Germany]] in 2003.]]

== Cultural counter-subversion ==
There is another strategy of neo-nazis and far right movements, that is called cultural subversion. This strategy uses already existing forms of expression and organization and fills them with far right meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/service/lexikon/k/kulturelle-subversion|title=Kulturelle Subversion - Mut Gegen Rechte Gewalt|website=www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples: 
*Music: use of already existing songs and the change of its lyrics into something national or racist 
*Slogans: the change of the left-wing slogan 'Long live the international solidarity' into 'Long live the national solidarity'
*Forms of Organization: democratic forms of organizations are copied and accommodated with far right ideology

== Modern forms of far-right subcultures and lifestyles in specific countries ==
=== Italy ===
During the regime the [[National Fascist Party]] heavily influenced fashion in the pursuit for autarchy and the importance of aesthetics and symbolism: clothes had to be produced in Italy and had to reflect the values of the Italian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=- la Repubblica.it|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/10/30/moda-autarchica-vestiti-di-regime-della.htmlhttp://mda-arte.blogspot.it/2012/09/mussolini-il-fascismo-e-la-moda.html|website=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces of clothing such as the '''black shirts''' became associated with the dreaded [[Blackshirts|Volunteer Militia for the Safety of the Nation]] and even to the regime itself. 
Nowadays [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascists]] still care a great deal about clothing, but with different approaches. Symbols and clothes like the [[Celtic Cross]] and the black clothing are still present and associated to the new filo-fascists political parties and movements, but, similarly to the neo-nazism case, there has also been a growing interest in "trendiness" and fashion, with new clothing brands that offer casual and formal clothing more in line with today's consumerist culture. This has led to three different types of brands usage by the neo-fascist subculture that still cares a big deal about clothing as a way to show their political affiliation, while caring about what is trendy as well:
* The use of brands that are not openly using symbols of fascism but that are thought to be targeting neo-fascist consumers in light of their choices in advertising and partnerships, with the choice of testimonials, models, settings and even copy material that recalls the neo-fascist archetypical man. For example, Pivert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pivert, l'hanno ribattezzata 'linea di abbigliamento fascista'. Il responsabile: "Non è così ma ai ragazzi di CasaPound piace"|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/01/26/pivert-lhanno-ribattezzata-linea-di-abbigliamento-fascista-il-responsabile-non-e-cosi-ma-ai-ragazzi-di-casapound-piace/2405761/|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of brands that while denying any political involvement (the apology of fascism in Italy is a felony officially) heavily rely on the fascist's regime icons, using symbols, mottos and images without using the name of the party while still making clear what is their political affiliation. An example is the decimaofficialstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Per Natale rivive l’abbigliamento fascista|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2014/12/22/news/per-natale-rivive-l-abbigliamento-fascista-1.192927|website=l'Espresso|language=it-IT|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of brands that are arbitrarily given a power of identification with their political values by the members of the subculture itself.

[[File:Neo-Nazi celtic cross flag.svg|thumb|[[Celtic cross]] on a Neo-Fascist flag]]

The arbitrary appropriation of modern devices of today's [[consumer culture]] in addition to the ones typical of its "ancestor" in Neo-fascism is not just limited to fashion, examples of modern culture products that were not born with this political affiliation but were used by neo-fascists to frame their values and the adherence of its affiliates to them are [[Tolkien]]'s novels, which led to the "Campi Hobbit" (Hobbit Camps) experience: real political camps where space was given to topics often overlooked by typical political institutions, with right wing music groups, visual artists, radio podcasts performances and social issues discussions about topics such as young people's unemployment together with paramilitary activities being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Repubblica 08 giugno 2007|url=http://www.compagniadellanello.net/rassegna/repubblica_08_06_07.htm|website=www.compagniadellanello.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another very famous example is the politicization of [[Association football|football]], with the [[Ultras]] groups often affiliated with certain ideologies. The majority of ultras groups in fact present small "bands" within them that are openly neo-fascist or at least far-right extremists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osservatoriosport.interno.gov.it/allegati/rapporto_2015_versione_stampabile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with groups such as Hellas Verona's "Brigate Gialloblu" or Juventus' "Vikings" having an infamous record of violence episodes, which are not related to the sport nor their supported teams' ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcio, la piaga nera del tifo fascista|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2016/07/11/news/calcio-la-piaga-nera-del-tifo-fascista-1.276905|website=l'Espresso|language=it-IT|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{category see also|Neo-Nazism in Germany}}

==== Far right Organisations und Formations in Germany ====
*Far right parties: East-Germany: [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD); West-Germany: 'Die Rechte' and 'Dritter Weg'. All together there are around 6000 members of far right parties in Germany.
*Extreme right-wing comradeships: [[Blood &amp; Honour]] network (or 'White Power'). Both networks are primarily selling extreme right-wing music and organizing international concerts. Their offers play an important role regarding the far right Lifestyle and they have an integrating effect on the far right scene in general. The [[Autonome Nationalisten]] are a similar organization, for predominantly young far right. The ideology is the same but in terms of aesthetics, they are more orientated towards their political opponent on the left and copy their lifestyles and symbols for their own purposes. See also Cultural Subversion
*Intellectuals of the 'Neue Rechte' ([[New Right]]): they function as the source of inspiration and keyword transmitter. 
*Far-right projects: An innovation of the last years are far right projects at the interface of virtual and real life. Examples are the 'Identitären' ([[Identitarian movement]]) and the 'Unsterblichen'. The 'Unsterblichen' was started by far rights in east Germany. They formulated the prosecution of the supposed 'Volkstods' (death of the nation). Which can be seen as relation to the demographic change in Germany and the  fear of being swamped by foreign influences. The 'Unsterblichen' took over the flashmob idea and produced high quality choreographies for demonstrations which they filmed professionally and distributed them with music in social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borstel|first1=Dierk|title=Ungleichwertigkeitsideologien in der Einwanderungsgesellschaft|date=2017|publisher=Springer Fachmedien|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=978-3-658-14245-2|pages=153–164|edition=Borstel, Dierk; Bozay, Kemal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Main Article'': [[Identitarian movement|Identitarian Movement]]

The Identitarian movement is one of the most renowned far-right youth culture in Germany and part of the [[New Right]]. Within the New Right it has four unique position features: youthfulness,  excessive desire for action, pop culture and [[Corporate Identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruns|first1=Julian|last2=Glösel|first2=Kathrin|last3=Strobl|first3=Natascha|title=Die Identitären.

''Main Article'': [[Alt-right|Alt-Right]]

==== The American Alt-Right Movement====

Also referred to as the alternative right, the [[alt-right]] is a recent political movement which holds strong views on a wide array of political, cultural, racial and religious subjects, with a central theme being [[white supremacy]] and [[white nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Definitive Source {{!}} Writing about the 'alt-right'|url=https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/writing-about-the-alt-right|website=blog.ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political movement of the American Alternative Right is a political movement that has gained significant prominence since the buildup to the consequent election of [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 US election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/alt-right-a-primer-about-the.html?referrer=https://www.google.it/#.WKQq3BIrKTc|website=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical alt-right supporter is a white US citizen, most likely of a family lineage without recent immigration to the USA. While there are numerous recorded cases of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim behaviour and supporters to be of predominantly Christian background, personal religious disposition does not prove to be of great importance beyond those which are discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michael|first1=George|title=The seeds of the alt-right, America's emergent right-wing populist movement|url=http://theconversation.com/the-seeds-of-the-alt-right-americas-emergent-right-wing-populist-movement-69036|website=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}}

==== Adoption of Neo-Fascist/Nazi symbolism ====

[[File:Richard B. Spencer in 2016.jpg|thumb|right|187px|Richard B. Spencer speaking at an Alt-Right Rally, 2016]]

Since Donald Trump's victory in November 2016, the exposure and symbolism associated with the alt-right has become more distinct. In mid-November 2016 at an alt-right conference with approximately 200 people in Washington, D.C. One of the speakers at this event was president of the National Policy Institute and white supremacist; [[Richard Spencer (activist)|Richard Spencer]]. Audience members cheered and gave the [[Nazi salute]] when he said, "Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Joseph|title=Alt-Right Gathering Exults in Trump Election With Nazi-Era Salute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html|website=The New York Times|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel theme of cultural purity combined with the totalitarian and ominous connotations associated with Nazi history provide an aesthetic appeal to the themes and ideas of the alt-right. Due to the highly superficial nature of the group, understanding of the key concepts behind these other far-right political movements is secondary to the imagery and visual culture associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|title=The 2016 culture war, as illustrated by the alt-right|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/30/13572256/2016-trump-culture-war-alt-right-meme|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Far-right subcultures and fashion labels ==
=== Fashion label abuse ===

Fashion label abuse means in this case, far-right movements, use specific labels and connect their ideology. Some prominent examples are [[Lonsdale (clothing)|Lonsdale]], [[Fred Perry]] and [[New Balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/fashion-labels-worn-by-europes-skinheads-restore-their-reputation/a-5226933|title=Fashion labels worn by Europe's skinheads restore their reputation - Culture - DW - 16.02.2010|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British sport label Lonsdale became popular in the German neo-nazi movement because of the letters 'NSDA' in the name, which refers to the National Socialist German Workers' Party ([[NSDAP]], [[Nazi Party]]), that was active between 1920 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lonsdale {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/lonsdale|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Fred Perry can be explained through the demand in the skinhead scene. On top of that the brand offers polo shirts with a collar in the colors black-white-red, which was the flag color used by the nazi regime and is therefore as well prominent in German neo-nazi movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fred Perry {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/fred-perry|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both brands distance themselves from any association. In November 2016 Matthew LeBretton, New Balance's vice president of public affairs, criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, that the Obama administration led and [[Donald Trump]] opposes. After New Balance defended its opposition to TTP, Andrew Anglin, publisher of the American [[neo-nazi]] news and commentary website [[The Daily Stormer]], declared New Balance the “Official Shoes of White People”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We live in crazy times: Neo-Nazis have declared New Balance the ‘Official Shoes of White People’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/15/the-crazy-reason-neo-nazis-have-declared-new-balance-the-official-shoes-of-white-people/|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion label creation around far-right ideology ===

There are also fashion labels that got created for neo-nazis, by neo-nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/marken-der-rechtsextremen-szene |title=Marken der rechtsextremen Szene |date=27 March 2009 |publisher=Netz-gegen-Nazis.de| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples for nazi fashion labels: Ansgar Aryan, Consdaple, Eric and Sons, Masterrace Europe, Outlaw, Reconquista, Rizist, Thor Steinar, Troublemaker, Dryve by Suizhyde, Greifvogel Wear, Hate-Hate, Hermannsland, Sport Frei, Pro Violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/marken-die-bei-neonazis-beliebt-sind|title=Marken, die bei Neonazis beliebt sind - Belltower News|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9105">Alleged '''Financial irregularities during the Manuel Zelaya administration''' received attention of many Hondurans.
In late 2008, [[Manuel Zelaya|Zelaya]] went as far as refusing to send Congress a budget, claiming that it was impossible to come up with numbers, even though the constitution required the president to provide budget. The alleged irregularities are currently being investigated by the post coup government.

==Early presidency==

At least 20 alleged corruption scandals came to light during his first year. By February 2007, his administration had prosecuted four cases, and three had been dismissed while the others were still being investigated.&lt;ref name="ips-corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36682 |title=CORRUPTION-HONDURAS: A Murky Transparency Law |date=2007-02-23 |publisher=Interpress Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226010842/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36682 |archivedate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early instances of alleged financial irregularities in the administration was a contract to resurface 94 miles of road from Tegucigalpa to Danli. The company was paid the full price of the contract, but it resurfaced only 50 kilometers.&lt;ref name="corruption"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Apertura/Ediciones/2009/06/28/Noticias/Corrupcion-una-constante-en-la-administracion-zelaya |title=Corrupción: una constante en la administración zelaya |publisher=La Prensa |date=2009-06-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lu8Y8quv?url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Apertura/Ediciones/2009/06/28/Noticias/Corrupcion-una-constante-en-la-administracion-zelaya |archivedate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelaya spent millions of dollars on consulting and professional costs without documentation.
A joint investigation by auditors in Honduras has so far identified alleged squandering of presidential expenses amounting to 123,025,613.63 lempiras.&lt;ref name="presidentialexpenses"&gt;[http://www.laprensahn.com/Internacionales/Ediciones/2009/09/06/Noticias/Investigan-120-casos-de-corrupcion-en-Presidencial Investigan 120 casos de corrupción en Presidencial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2009/09/06/Noticias/Investigaran-otros-120-escandalos-en-Presidencial |title=Investigarán otros 120 escándalos en Presidencial |publisher=El Heraldo |date=2009-09-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lu9AGHb1?url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2009/09/06/Noticias/Investigaran-otros-120-escandalos-en-Presidencial |archivedate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hondurannews.com/article/publish/casa_de_gobierno/More_than_50_corruption_cases_forwarded_to_Presidential_MP.shtml |title=More than 50 corruption cases forwarded to Presidential MP |publisher=Honduran News |date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asjhonduras.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92:manuel-zelaya-idefensor-de-los-pobres |title=Manuel Zelaya ¿Defensor de los pobres? |publisher=ASJ Honduras |date=2009-10-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lu8wtpUO?url=http://asjhonduras.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92%3Amanuel-zelaya-idefensor-de-los-pobres |archivedate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }} ([http://www.ajshonduras.org/Zelaya_defender_of_the_poor.htm English version])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption at Hondutel===
{{Main|Hondutel}}

[[Hondutel]] was the best-documented case of embezzlement. Manuel Zelaya's nephew [[Marcelo Chimirri]] is one of the suspects. The investigations were helped by evidence retrieved by the [[FBI]]. After the scandal was published in Honduran media, Chimirri sued the journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifex.org/honduras/2007/10/05/court_declares_inadmissible_lawsuit/ |title=Court declares inadmissible lawsuit against five journalists for "damage to reputation" | publisher=Reporters Without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renato Alvarez]] was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months in prison.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===2008 Allegations===
Zelaya allegedly earmarked 5.4 million lempiras on mobilizing supporters of the country's accession to the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]] (ALBA), an organization founded by [[Hugo Chávez]]. The pro-ALBA "demonstration" took place on August 25, 2008. The beneficiaries included 38 individuals, union leaders, unions, and owners transport companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/29980 |title=TSC y Fiscalía investigan despilfarro de 5.4 millones |publisher=El Heraldo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[constitution of Honduras]] requires that the President files the budget by September 15. Zelaya refused. He claimed that it was impossible to come up with numbers.&lt;ref name="wsjbehindmutiny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124847775316780293 |title=Behind the Honduran Mutiny |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2009-07-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5luAn0H8h?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124847775316780293.html |archivedate=2009-12-10 |first=Jose |last=De Cordoba |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poder3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.poder360.com/article_detail.php?id_article=2690&amp;pag=3 |title=Crisis in Honduras What was really behind the removal of President Manuel Zelaya, and is he likely to be reinstated? |publisher=Poder |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julio Raudales, Zelaya’s former deputy minister, said the budgetary black hole cost the country some $400 million in funding.&lt;ref name="poder3"/&gt; [[Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga|Cardinal Rodríguez]] criticized Zelaya for using public money to promote his plans instead of spending it on the poor. He said "We were good friends. But he changed drastically... It was Chávez."&lt;ref name="poder3"/&gt;

On September 30, 2008 Zelaya issued emergency executive decree 46-A-2208, which authorized transfer of 30 million lempiras of public money to advertising of his fourth ballot box. Soon after he issued another emergency executive decree which is identical except that the money is transferred to his office.
Auditors later found documentation of 29 checks and total 29,995,887.62 lempiras. The expenses weren't well documented.The supposed advertisers paid no sales tax.

===2009 Allegations===
On May 30, 2009, auditors found that Zelaya had directly spent more than 2 billion lempiras without competitive bidding.&lt;ref name="zelayabidding"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/138934 |title=2,113 millones erogó el gobierno en compras directas sin licitación |publisher=El Heraldo |date=2009-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, [[Enrique Flores Lanza]], Zelaya's chief of staff, withdrew millions of dollars from the [[Central Bank of Honduras]]. The money was taken "to help the Ministry of the Presidency" and transported by car to Lanza's office. The suspected theft was captured by surveillance cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/22/zelaya-accused-of-cash-withdrawal/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Ousted Honduran leader accused of theft|publisher=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Without breaking stride, homeward bound commuter as the Staten Island Ferry Terminal reaches for leaflet from street... - NARA - 549907.jpg|thumb|upright|Leaflets being handed out in [[New York City]] (1973)]]
[[File:Flyers sobe 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hundreds of flyers litter the streets in [[South Beach]], [[Miami]].  Scenes like these are not uncommon in cities known for their [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]]]
[[File:Helmand leaflets350.jpg|thumb|[[Airborne leaflet propaganda|Distribution of leaflets]] over [[Afghanistan]] by the U.S. military in 2010]]
[[File:Flyers in China 02.jpg|thumb|Flyers pasted to a wall in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]]]]

A '''flyer''' is a form of [[paper]] [[advertisement]] intended for wide distribution and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail. In the 2010s, flyers range from inexpensively [[photocopier|photocopied]] leaflets to expensive, glossy, full-color circulars.

==Terminology==
A flyer is also called a "flier", "circular", "handbill", "[[pamphlet]]", "poster", "lit'" (literature), "weekly ad", "catalogue" or "leaflet".{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Usage==
Flyers may be used by individuals, [[business]]es, not-for-profit organizations or governments to:
* Advertise an event such as a music [[concert]], [[nightclub]] appearance, [[festival]], or political [[Demonstration (people)|rally]]
* Promote a [[Good (economics)|good]]s-selling businesses such as a [[used car]] lot [[discount store]] or a [[Service (economics)|service]] business such as a [[restaurant]] or [[massage parlour]].
* Persuade people about a social, religious, or political message, as in [[evangelism]] or [[political campaign]] activities on behalf of a [[political party]] or candidate during an election. Flyers have been used in armed conflict: for example, [[airborne leaflet propaganda]] has been a tactic of [[psychological warfare]].
* Recruit members for organizations or companies.

Like [[postcard]]s, [[pamphlet]]s and small [[poster]]s, flyers are a low-cost form of [[mass marketing]] or [[communication]]. There are many different flyer formats. Some examples include:
* [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] (roughly [[letterhead]] size)
* A5 (roughly half letterhead size)
* DL ([[compliments slip]] size)
* A6 ([[postcard]] size)

[[File:Commonsense.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] was a pamphlet that was distributed preceding the American Revolution]]
Flyers are inexpensive to produce and they required only a basic [[printing press]] from the 18th century to the 20th century. Their widespread use intensified in the 1990s with the spread of less expensive [[desktop publishing]] systems. In the 2010s, inexpensive black and white flyers can be produced with just a [[personal computer]] and a [[computer printer]]. In the 2010s, the ordering of flyers through traditional printing services has been supplanted by [[Internet]] services. Customers send designs, review proofs online or via e-mail and receive the final products by mail.

Flyers are not a new medium: prior to the [[War of American Independence]] some colonists were outraged with the [[Stamp Act (1765)]] and gathered together in anti-stamp act congresses and meetings. In these congresses they had to win support, and issued handbills and leaflets, pamphlets, along with other written paraphernalia, to do so.

In the 2000s, some jurisdictions have laws or [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] banning or restricting leafleting or flyering in certain locations. Owners of private property may put up signs saying "Post No Bills"; this occurs particularly on wooden fences surrounding building sites or vacant lots.

==Distribution and use==
Flyers are handed out on the [[street]] (a practice known as "flyering" or "leafleting"), distributed door-to-door through the mail, posted on [[bulletin board]]s, put under windshield wipers of cars, given away at events or on the street, or affixed to telephone poles, walls, or other surfaces. Bulletin boards are found on [[college campus]]es, in [[café]]s, community meeting houses, [[laundromat]]s and small markets. Cheap to produce, contemporary flyers are frequently produced in 300&amp;nbsp;[[paper density|g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] glossy card, whereas a leaflet might be produced on a 130&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–170&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; weight paper and can be a very effective form of [[direct marketing]].

In the 2010s, some individuals and organizations send flyers through [[e-mail]], a tactic that avoids spending money on paper, printing and mailing or hiring people to post the flyers on telephone poles or hand them out. The electronic [http://www.chapmatin.com/%da%86%d8%a7%d9%be-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%aa/ flyer] may be embedded into the body of the e-mail or added as an attachment to be opened.

The '''Gabo Reform''', also known as the '''Kabo Reform''', describes a series of sweeping reforms suggested to the government of [[Korea]] beginning in 1894 and ending in 1896 during the reign of [[Gojong of Korea]] in response to the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]]. Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} as well as its effect in encouraging modernization. The name Gabo (갑오, 甲午) comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional [[sexagenary cycle]].&lt;ref name="gabo nate"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 Gabo Reforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610003901/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&amp;i=110660&amp;v=44 |date=2011-06-10 }} at Nate Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The disarray and blatant corruption in the Korean government, particularly in the three main areas of revenues – land tax, military service and the state granary system – weighed heavily on the Korean peasantry which represented 90% of the population and was uniformly illiterate. Of special note is the corruption of the local functionaries (Hyangi) who could purchase an appointment as administrators and so cloak their predations on the farmers with an aura of officialdom. [[Yangban]] families, formerly well-respected for their status as a noble class, were increasingly seen as little more than commoners who were unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their communities. Faced with increasing corruption in the government, [[brigandage]] of the disenfranchised -(such as the mounted fire brigands, or ''Hwajok'', and the boat-borne water brigands or ''Sujok'')- as well as abuse by the military, many poor village folk sought to pool their resources such as land, tools and production in order to survive. Despite the government abolishing slavery and burning the records in 1801, increasing numbers of peasants and farmers become involved in KYE or "mutual assistance associations". Institutions such as the Catholic and Protestant missions, with the egalitarian nature of their teachings garnered followings among the Yangban, though commonly in the more urban areas.

Arguably of greater influence were the religious teachings of Choi Che-u, (최제우, 崔濟愚, 1824–1864) called [[Donghak]] or "Eastern Learning" which became especially popular in rural areas. Themes of Exclusionism (of foreign influences), Nationalism, Salvation and Social Consciousness were set to music allowing illiterate farmers to understand and accept them more readily. Choe, as well as many Koreans, was also alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing during the 2nd Opium War. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democratic and human rights reforms internally. Nationalism and social reform struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas, and [[Donghak]] spread all across Korea. Progressive revolutionaries organized the peasants into a cohesive structure. Arrested in 1863 following the Chinju Uprising led by YU Kye-cheun, Choe was charged with "misleading the people and sowing discord in society". Choe was executed in 1864, sending many of his followers into hiding in the mountains and leaving the Korean populace to continue to suffer.

[[Gojong of Korea|King Kojong]] (r. 1864-1910), enthroned at the age of twelve, succeeded [[Cheoljong of Joseon|King Cheolchong]] (r. 1849 - 1863). King Kojong's father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]](Yi Ha-Ung; 1820-1898), ruled as the de facto regent and inaugurated far-ranging reform to strengthen the central administration.  Among his targeted reforms was addressing the inherited rule by a few elite ruling families by the adoption of a merit system for official appointments. In addition, [Seowon] (private academies), which threatened to develop a parallel system to the corrupt government and enjoyed special privileges and large land-holdings, were repressed through taxes despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars. The decision to rebuild palace buildings and finance it through additional levies on the population caused [[Heungseon Daewongun]]'s attempted reforms to antagonize the three largest constituencies supporting the government: the ruling elite, the Confucian scholars and the general population. [[Heungseon Daewongun]] was impeached in 1873 and forced into retirement by the supporters of [[Empress Myeongseong]].

On 27 February 1876, the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876]], also known in Japan as the Japanese-Korea Treaty of Amity (Japanese language: 日朝修好条規 Nitchō-shūkōjōki, Korean language: 강화도조약 江華島條約 Ganghwado joyak) was signed. It was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade, and the rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted Western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry in 1854.[9]. However, the treaty ended Korea's status as a protectorate of China, forced open three Korean ports to Japanese trade, granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens and was an unequal treaty signed under duress of the [[Unyo Incident|Unyo Incident of 1875]] (gunboat diplomacy).[9] Daewongun remained opposed to any concessions to Japan or the West, helped organize the Mutiny of 1882 [[Imo Incident]], an anti-Japanese outbreak against the Empress and her allies.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"&gt;Marius B. Jansen (April 1989). The Cambridge History of Japan Volume 5 The Nineteenth Century. Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-22356-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by resentment of the preferential treatment given to newly trained troops, Daewongun's forces, or "old military", killed Japanese training cadre and attacked the Japanese [[legation]].&lt;ref name="Marius B.

Daewongun was restored to power briefly, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to [[Seoul]] to prevent further disorder.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; In August 1882, the Treaty of Chemulpo ([[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1882]]) idemnified the families of the Japanese victims, paid reparation to the Japanese government in the amount of 500,000 yen and allowed a company of Japanese guards to be stationed at the Japanese legation in Seoul.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

The struggle between Heungseon Daewongun's followers and those of Empress Myeongseong was further complicated by competition from a Korean independence faction known as the Progressive Party (Kaehwadang) as well as Conservative faction. While the former sought Japan's support, the latter sought China's support.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; On 4 December 1884, the Korean independence group, assisted by the Japanese, attempted a coup (Kapsin Chongbyon; Coup d'État of 1884) and established a pro-Japanese government under the reigning king, dedicated to the independence of Korea from Chinese suzerainty.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; However, this proved short-lived, as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt; Some leaders of the independence faction, including [[Kim Okgyun]], fled to Japan, while others were executed.&lt;ref name="Marius B. Jansen"/&gt;

== Donghak revolution, and first Sino-Japanese war, 1894 ==
{{Main|Donghak Peasant Revolution|First Sino-Japanese War}}

The outbreak of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894 provided a seminal pretext for direct military intervention by Japan in the affairs of Korea. Seeking redress of long-standing hardship and corruption disparate factions among the Korean peasant population coalesced into a militant force and revolted against the Korean administration. In April, 1894 the Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the Donghak Peasant Revolt. In response Japanese leaders, citing a violation of Convention of Tientsin as a pretext, decided upon military intervention to challenge China. China requested Japan withdraw her troops, Japan refused and proposed that the Qing and Japan co-ordinate to reform the Korean government. The Qing refused. On May 3, 1894, 1,500 Qing Dynasty forces appeared in Incheon. The same day, 6,000 Japanese forces also landed in Incheon leading to the Sino-Japanese War.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Japan deposed the Korean government and installed a new government which demanded the Qing leave, and began a programme of reform. Japan won the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], and China signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized "the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea," thus ending Korea's [[Tributary state|tributary]] relationship with the Chinese Qing Dynasty, leading to the proclamation of full independence of Joseon Korea in 1895. At the same time, Japan suppressed the Donghak Revolution with Korean government forces. Though the revolt had been ended, the issues and complaints of the Korean peasant population remained unaddressed.

==Reforms==
The reforms were done largely in three stages, according to the changing members of the reform council and the involvement of Japan. There were three stages of development.

===First reforms===
The first reforms took place from July to October 1894, based on the original reform bill presented by Japanese ambassador [[Ōtori Keisuke|Otori Keisuke (大鳥圭介)]], that had been previously refused by the [[Joseon]] court and [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt; As Japan was focused more on the Sino-Japanese War, many of the first reforms reflected the desired reforms of the progressive council members and some of the reforms demanded by the peasants of the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] did not go undenied.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt; The deliberate Council passed 210 reform bills by Kim Hongjip. At the first stage of reform, there was little interference from Japan.

Two-hundred and ten articles were established, most notably the restructuring of central government by greatly reducing the king's responsibilities and placing more power in the ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]''. The ''gwageo'' system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; 
Other social reforms were addressed as well; discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were all banned and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

===Second reforms===
The second state of reform took place from December 1894 to July 1895. Japan closed down the ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' in December 1894 as the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War was leaning to their favor and set up a new coalition cabinet consisting of Kim Hongjip and Park Younghyo. The cabinet presented a new law, ''Hongbeom 14jo'' (홍범 14조, "Exemplary Rules" 14 articles), which proclaimed the severance of the subordinate relationship with China, abolishment of nepotism in government, restructure of government offices and their duties. With this law as foundation, 213 new articles were created.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;
The names of ''[[State Council of Joseon|Uijeongbu]]'' and its subsidiaries were changed to the modern ''naegak'' (내각, cabinet) and ''bu'' (부, department). Administrative districts were reorganized to 23 ''bu''(부, region) and 337 ''gun''(군, district). New financial bureaus were installed throughout the nation to overlook tax affairs, military and police systems were rehauled and modernized, judicial systems were changed with new courthouse and judiciary laws.&lt;ref name="gabo daum"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b01g1339a Gabo Reforms] at Daum Britannica Korea&lt;/ref&gt;

The second reform measures were halted when Park Young Hyo, who had been at the center of the reform efforts, fled to Japan after being accused of conspiracy to treason by those who were against the reformations that were taking place.&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} Kang Junman (강준만), ''Walk through Korea's Modern History 2'' (한국근대사산책 2) p291, [http://inmul.co.kr/ Inmul Publishing Co.(인물과 사상사)], Seoul, 2007. {{ISBN|978-89-5906-072-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of Queen Min, 1895 ===
{{Main|Empress Myeongseong}}
The Japanese minister to Korea, [[Miura Gorō]], orchestrated a plot against 43-year-old Queen Min&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217083556/http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min.htm |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents included the testimony of King Gojong, several witnesses of the assassination, and [[Karl Ivanovich Weber]]'s report to [[Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky]], the Foreign Minister of Russia. Weber was the [[chargé d'affaires]] at the Russian legation in Seoul at that time.&lt;ref name="Dong-a 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/shin/2004/11/09/200411090500053/200411090500053_1.html |script-title=ko:일본인 폭도가 가슴을 세 번 짓밟고 일본도로 난자했다 |publisher=[[Dong-a Ilbo]] |author=Park Jong-hyo (박종효), former professor at [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]] |date= 2002-01-01 |issue= 508 |pages=472 ~ 485|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Russian eyewitness, Seredin-Sabatin (Середин-Cабатин), an employee of the Korean king, a group of Japanese agents entered [[Gyeongbokgung]],&lt;ref&gt;See Russian eyewitness account of surrounding circumstances at {{cite web|url=http://koreaweb.ws/ks/ksr/queenmin.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005946/http://koreaweb.ws/ks/ksr/queenmin.txt |archivedate=2012-10-12 |df= }} by [[Gari Ledyard]], Sejong Professor of Korean History Emeritus at [[Columbia University]]&lt;/ref&gt; killed Queen Min and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tatiana |last=Simbirtseva |coauthors= |title=Queen Min of Korea: Coming to Power |date=1996-05-08 |publisher= |url=http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min_tmsimbirtseva_1996.htm |work= |pages= |accessdate=2007-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217083556/http://www.gkn-la.net/history_resources/queen_min.htm |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he heard the news, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] returned to the royal palace the same day.&lt;ref name="Dong-a 2002"/&gt; On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung to the [[Russia]]n legation in [[Jeong-dong]], Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation]]. After returning to the royal palace, the royal family was still guarded by Russian guards.

In the midst of disarray in Joseon politics at this time, a series of [[Seonbi]] scholars mobilized volunteers to fight against the external foreign influence on the government. This also led to the uprising of the Eulmi temporary armies aimed at avenging the assassination of Queen Min.

===Third reforms===
Spurred greatly by the assassination of the queen and subsequent unrest, the government, then led by a new progressive cabinet headed by [[Kim Hong-jip]] and [[Yu Kil-chun]], carried out reforms from October 1895 to February 1896.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=4790 Gabo Reforms] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"&gt;''Korea through the Ages Vol. 2'' p40-p43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;dq=Gabo+reforms+Kim+Hong+jip&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Y64Oh8n2h&amp;sig=WaF0OZsvJAANg-ispTdZ6V_Be3c&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; A special reform body, ''Gunguk Gimucheo'' (군국기무처, Deliberative Council), was created to establish rules.&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt; Their policies resulted in the official discarding of the [[lunar calendar]] in favor of the modern Gregorian [[solar calendar]], the official designation of [[regnal years]] independent of the Chinese tradition, the creation of a [[mail|postal service]], the introduction of primary schools and a new educational system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/04/181_24875.html Gabo Reforms], [[Korea Times]], 2008-05-28. Retrieved 2010-06-23&lt;/ref&gt; and the renewal of the military system.&lt;ref name="gabo doosan"/&gt;

The most controversial reform at this time was the proclamation of the "Short Hair Act" ({{korean|hangul=단발령|hanja=斷髮令}}), i.e. cutting off the traditional Korean male sangtu and reformation of traditional attire. It triggered many protests among the people, most notably the conservative scholars, who were already disillusioned by the pro-Japanese cabinet. They had created the [[Righteous Army]] and had actively protested nationwide; protests which escalated after the assassination of Empress Myeongseong in 1895. After King Gojong and the [[Sunjong of Korea|Crown Prince]] fled for refuge to the [[Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation|Russian legation]] in 1896, this opposition resulted in the murders of Kim Hongjip and other cabinet members, and the reformations came to an end.{{sfn|Kang|2006|p=483}}&lt;ref name="gabo nate"/&gt;

===Main provisions of the Gabo Reform===
The Gabo Reform was similar to the [[Meiji Restoration]] in [[Japan]] and produced the following sweeping changes and declarations:&lt;ref name="gabo ktta"/&gt;
# Korea is a sovereign country (i.e., completely independent from [[China]]'s external interference).
# Hierarchical society ([[social class|class]] system) is abolished. Social privileges of the yangban class are eliminated.

# [[Tanning (leather)|Leather working]], [[acting]], and so on are to no longer be regarded as degrading work, and the people who do them are no longer outcastes. 
# A sound system of fiscal management and to use the government's fiscal resources to create wealth for the country is developed.
# Torture of suspects and witnesses was banned, guilt by association ended (punishment of family members of criminals)

=== Protests for democracy and the proclamation of Korean Empire, 1896-1898 ===
{{Main|Independence Club|Korean Empire}}
After the Royal Refuge, some Korean activists established the [[Independence Club]] (독립협회, 獨立協會) in 1896. They claimed that Korea should negotiate with Western powers, particularly Russia, to counterbalance the growing influence of Japan and Russia. This club had contributed to the construction of [[Independence Gate]], and they held regular meetings at the [[Jongno]] streets, demanding [[democracy|democratic]] reforms as Korea became a constitutional monarchy, and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. In October 1897, King Gojong decided to return to his other palace, [[Deoksugung]], and proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]]. During this period, the Korean government conducted a westernization policy. It was not an enduring reform, however, and the Independence Club was dissolved on 25 December 1898 as [[Emperor Gojong]] officially announced a prohibition on unofficial congresses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">'''Golus nationalism''' (Yiddish: גלות נאַציאָנאַליזם ''Golus natsionalizm'' after [[Jewish diaspora|golus]]), or Diaspora Nationalism, is a [[Nationalism|national]] movement of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] that argued for furthering Jewish national and cultural life in the large Jewish centers throughout the world, while at the same time seeking recognition for a Jewish national identity from world powers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Yiddish Culture: The Story of the Yiddish Language Movement|last=Goldsmith|first=Emanuel S.|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=1997|isbn=0823216950|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Golus Nationalism was conceived by [[Nathan Birnbaum]], the Austrian philosopher who had given [[Zionism]] its name. Although Birnbaum was an early theorist of Zionism and participated in the [[First Zionist Congress]] (1897), he broke with the movement shortly after. Birnbaum began to develop a theory of pan-Judaism (''Alljudentum''), which embraced Jewish life in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laboratory for World Destruction: Germans and Jews in Central Europe|last=Wistrich|first=Robert S.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2007|isbn=0803211341|location=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum was opposed to the idea that [[Jewish assimilation]] was inevitable, inspired by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who had retained Yiddish as a language, had a robust folk culture, and banded together in recognizably distinct communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Seeking recognition for Jewish nationality ==
Birnbaum made several attempts to have a Jewish national identity recognized by state powers. In 1907, he unsuccessfully advocated for [[Yiddish]] to be included as a Jewish national language in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] census. The following year, he ran a popular but fruitless campaign for a seat in Parliament. In 1910, he again attempted to have Yiddish recognized. Birnbaum felt that if he could get state recognition for elements of Jewish nationhood, he could petition for Jews to have shared control of a province in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. He was encouraged by the fact that the Austro-Hungarian Empire was offering the possibility of autonomous regions to ethnic groups and nationalities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yiddish: A Nation of Words|last=Weinstein|first=Miriam|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=2002|isbn=0345447301|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum also propagandized on behalf of Yiddish as a language, coining the words "Yiddishism" and "Yiddishist." He organized Yiddish events in [[Vienna]], translate Yiddish authors into German, and in 1905 established a student organization for the furtherance of the language called ''Yidishe Kultur''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1908, he organized an international conference on the Yiddish language in [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], in which different Jewish factions squared off as to whether Yiddish should be declared the official language of Jewish nationalism or instead one of several Jewish languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influence ==
Golus nationalism prefigured a variety of attempts to reconcile Jewish identity with the experience of diaspora. Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan|Mordecai M. Kaplan]] would wrestle with similar themes, developing a theory that Judaism should be seen as a civilization, rather than a religion, and founding [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] on this theory. Yiddishist [[Abraham Golomb]] wrote frequently about maintaining a Jewish identity in the Diaspora, and the centrality of Yiddish and Hebrew in this pursuit.

'''Governmentality''' is a concept first developed by the French [[philosopher]] [[Michel Foucault]] in the later years of his life, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the [[Collège de France]] during this time.

The concept has been elaborated further from an "Anglo-Neo Foucauldian" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, [[Nikolas Rose]], and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as:
* the way [[government]]s try to produce the citizen best suited to fulfill those governments' policies
* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, Susan (ed) ''A Dictionary of Geography'' (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Governmentality may also be understood as:

==Semantics==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the "...linking of governing ("gouverner") and modes of thought ("mentalité")".&lt;ref name="lemke2"&gt;{{cite book|title='The birth of bio-politics: Michael Foucault's lectures at the College de France on neo-liberal governmentality' in ''Economy and Society'' v.30, i.2, p.&amp;nbsp;190-207|author=Lemke, T|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was not coined by uniting words "gouvernement" and "mentalité", but simply by making ''gouvernement'' into ''gouvernementalité'' just like ''musical'' into ''musicalité'' [i.e. government + -al- ''adjective'' + -ité ''abstract noun''] (see Michel Senellart's "Course Context" in Foucault's "Security, territory, population" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of "governing" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 90&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, "...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, for our purposes, government is "...the conduct of conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault in Burchell, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic definition==
{{original research|date=March 2011}}
In his lectures at the [[Collège de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the "art of government" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of "government" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the "biopolitical" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as [[biopower|biopolitics]] and [[power-knowledge]]. The [[genealogy|genealogical]] exploration of the modern state as "problem of government" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom.&lt;ref name="mallette"&gt;{{cite book|title=La "gouvernementalité" chez Michel Foucault. M. A., Faculté de Philosophie|author=Malette S.|year=2006|publisher=Université Laval - Québec|url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2006/23836/23836.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "governmentality" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

"Governmentality" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to "neoliberal governmentality", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in [[neoliberalism]]. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (''"savoir"'' in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
{{quote|
"1. The ensemble formed by the institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, the calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its target population, as its principal form of knowledge political economy, and as its essential technical means apparatuses of security.&lt;br /&gt;

2. The tendency which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs.&lt;br /&gt;

3. The process, or rather the result of the process, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the administrative state during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'."&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"&gt;Burchell, Gordon and Miller, 1991: 102-103&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its "apparatuses of security," that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting "political economy," and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, "economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods".&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 92&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault's definition (the "resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs"&lt;ref name="BGM102-103"/&gt;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early [[Renaissance]] state, which became more concerned with the "disposing of things",&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, 95&lt;/ref&gt; and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to "render a society governable".&lt;ref&gt;Jones 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"&lt;ref name=B102&gt;Burchell, 102&lt;/ref&gt;), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"&lt;ref name=B102/&gt;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's [[ethical]], [[political]] and [[historical]] thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled "Security, territory and population" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on "The Birth of Biopolitics" at the [[Collège de France]] in 1978-1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as ''Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)'' (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on [[neoliberalism]] and the "Rule of Law", the "microphysics of power" and also on what Foucault called [[biopower|biopolitics]]. In the second and third volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', namely, ''The Use of Pleasure'' (1984) and ''The Care of the Self'' (1984), and in his lecture on "Technologies of the Self" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between [[subjectivation]] and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including "The Birth of Biopolitics" (1979), "''Omnes et Singulatim'': Towards a Criticism of Political Reason" (1979), "The Subject and Power" (1982) and "What is Enlightenment?" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary [[social order]]s, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of "governmentality".

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with [[governance]]) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book ''The Foucault Effect'' (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on ''"gouvernementalité"''.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work ''Foucault and Law'' [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, "governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '–ity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences" [1994:77].

Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of "governmental rationality" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not "a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a "collective activity" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually "examined by those who inhabit it" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in "can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects "technologies of power" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any "conduct of conduct" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood "from within its own perspective" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. [[Francis Fukuyama|Fukuyama]] [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes "a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic [[Cartography|mapping]] has historically been a key strategy of governmentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose-Redwood|first=R.B.|title=Governmentality, Geography, and the Geo-Coded World|journal=Progress in Human Geography.|year=2006|volume=30|issue=4|pages=469–486|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph619oa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brian Harley|Harley]],&lt;ref name ="Harley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B.|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica |year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], affirms that [[Sovereign state|State]]-produced maps "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s concept of a [[panopticon]], in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.&lt;ref name="Hannah 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=M.G|title=Governmentality and the Mastery of Territory in Nineteenth-Century America|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of [[neoliberalism]], the State has "hollowed out" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical [[scale (map)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=B|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing Out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial [[governance]] than traditional [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] State-distribution of cartographic knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Crampton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping Without a Net|journal=Paper Presented as Part of Virtual Seminar in GIScience and Technology|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus subverting Harley's&lt;ref name=Harley /&gt; theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful. Joyce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joyce|first=P|title=The Rule of Freedom: Liberalism and the Modern City|year=2003|publisher=Verso|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenges Foucauldian notions of Panopticism, contending that neoliberal governmentality is more adequately conceptualised by an omniopticon - 'the many surveilling the many'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S|author2=Leszczy, L|title=Privacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb|journal=Geoforum|year=2010|volume=42|pages=6–11|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative mapping]] initiatives utilising [[GPS]] technology are arguably omniopticons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingsbury|first=P|author2=Jones, J.P|title=Walter Benjamin's Dionysian Adventures on Google Earth|journal=Geoforum|year=2009|volume=40|issue=4|pages=502–513|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability to reverse the panoptic [[gaze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Natios |first=D |title=Reversing the Panopticon |url=http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm |accessdate=29 October 2011 |author2=Young, Y |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211004/http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and [[autonomy]]. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of [[political power]], but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those "technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
[[Technologies of the self]] refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
[[Healthism]] links the "public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather "individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of [[Normalization (sociology)|normalisation]]. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable".&lt;ref&gt;Rose, 1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of [[shame]]. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:273&lt;/ref&gt; The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 2001:202&lt;/ref&gt; These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for "evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so".&lt;ref&gt;Cruikshank, 1996:234&lt;/ref&gt; By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:86&lt;/ref&gt; We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:76&lt;/ref&gt; Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.&lt;ref&gt;Rose,1999:87&lt;/ref&gt; If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism.  Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
[[Ecogovernmentality]] (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[Government agency|government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct "The Environment." This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of Governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, "liberal art of government" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of [[risk society|risk]] or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9).'' Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

1. Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding "degeneration."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's [[Panopticon]] surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices "irregularities."&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply "counterweighted" by it.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the [[Keynesian]] [[welfare state]] under [[F.D. Roosevelt]], the thought of the German liberals in the [[Freiburg school]], and the thought of American [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists such as the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]] which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 67"/&gt;

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a "legal strait-jacket" for the state,&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"&gt;Foucault, 2008, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state.&lt;ref name="Foucault, 2008, 68"/&gt; and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, 2008, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to health care ===

(2004) Governmentality by Network in English Primary Care. Social Policy and Administration 70, 779-86.&lt;/ref&gt; have recently suggested that the concept of governmentality may be useful in explaining the operation of evidence-based health care and the internalization of clinical guidelines relating to best practice for patient populations, such as those developed by the American Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).  Recent research by [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and colleagues at the [[University of Oxford]] has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The courage of truth (the government of self and others II) : lectures at the Collège de France, 1983-1984|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK|isbn=9781403986689 |author2=Ewald, François |author3=Burchell, Alessandro Fontana |editor=Arnold I.

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009)  highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. &amp; Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.&lt;ref&gt;[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-415-54744-4}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts.

{{Greek economic crisis}}
The '''[[Greek government-debt crisis]]''' began in 2009 and, as of November 2017, was still ongoing. During this period, many changes had occurred in Greece. The income of many Greeks has declined, levels of unemployment have increased, elections and resignations of politicians have altered the country's political landscape radically, the Greek parliament has passed many [[austerity]] bills, and protests have become common sights throughout the country.

==Background==
{{Greek debt crisis cabinets}}
Greece joined the [[European Communities]] (subsequently subsumed by the [[European Union]]) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth.  Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping and a fast-growing service sector raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. The country adopted the [[Euro]] in 2001 and over the next 7 years the country's [[GDP per capita]] more than doubled, from $13,070 in 2001 to $28,660 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank Data, http://data.worldbank.org/country/greece&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek government, encouraged by the [[European Commission]], [[European Central Bank]], private banking institutions, and the Greek business community also took out loans to pay Greek and foreign infrastructure companies for a wide variety of infrastructure projects such as those related to the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in Athens.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/greece/index_en.htm |work= Member States of the EU |publisher=[[European Union]] |accessdate=7 April 2007 |title= Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=July 2015}} Government deficits were also consistently underreported.&lt;ref name="anil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/A-Primer-on-the-Greek-Crisis_june29.pdf |accessdate= 16 July 2015 |title= A Primer on the Greek Crisis: the things you need to know from the start until now}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] began to affect Greece's economy, the country's GDP stagnated between 2008 and 2010 and the government's capacity to repay its creditors was drastically reduced.

==2009==
===Political events===
*'''4 October 2009''' – The centre-left [[PASOK]] wins the [[Greek legislative election, 2009|Greek legislative elections]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">'''Historical determinism''' is the stance that events are historically predetermined or currently constrained by various forces. Historical determinism can be understood in contrast to its negation, i.e. the rejection of historical determinism.

Some political philosophies (e.g. Early and Stalinist [[Marxism]]) assert a [[historical materialism]] of either predetermination or constraint, or both.

Used as a pejorative, it is normally meant to designate an overdetermination of present possibilities by historical conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11143">{{essay-like|date=February 2012}}
'''Issue advocacy ads''' (also known as '''interest advocacy ads''' or '''issue only ads''') are communications intended to bring awareness to a certain problem.  Groups that sponsor this form of communication are known by several names including: [[Advocacy group|interest advocacy group, issue advocacy group, issue only group, or special interest group]].  The problems these groups raise awareness of can be either a social or political issue.

==Interest versus express advocacy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The bright-line test doesn't cover forms of communication that are indirect or debatable.  Consider this message to voters:

*''If you like candidate X, you need to know he did Y.''

In a communication like this, there is no mention about voting, however, the plain intention is to cast doubt on voters that supported candidate X.  

Campaigning like this is typically called [[negative campaigning]], making attack ads, or making thinly veiled promotional ads on the behalf of the candidate.

===Interest advocacy===
Interest advocacy is the act of making generalized communication regarding a public issue or problem without advocating voters to take a specific action at the election booth.&lt;ref name="moritz"&gt;[http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/ebook/part3/campaign_finance_fed_glossary.html by Michelle Robinson, Section 3.1 - Campaign finance, Subsection 3.1.1 Federal law, Glossary of term, Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of a pure "issue only ads" made by interest advocacy groups is difficult.  Groups that sponsored messages needed to make it clear, to a voter with [[reasonable person|reasonable intelligence]], that the voter should cast their ballot in a manner the group wanted.

Keeping an advertisement issue important to only groups like [[501(c)(3)]] non-profits. They were subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political activities. Organizations can participate in nonpartisan voter education efforts, including registration and "get-out-the-vote" drives and issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="Elacqua"&gt;[http://www.hbtlj.org/v08p1/v08p1elacquaar.pdf Eyes wide shut: The ambiguous "political activity" prohibition and its effects on 501(c)(3) organizations, Houston Business and Tax Journal, by Amelia Elacqua, 2008, p. 118, 119 and 141, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Express advocacy===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Express advocacy is largely used in connection with a debate in the US regarding when issue advocacy turns into [[political campaign|campaigning]]. 

Many groups that made what appeared to most to be campaign advertisements claimed that their communications to voters were really issue advocacy and not express advocacy. To help understand the difference, examine these two communications to voters: 

*''Select John Smith.''
*''Vote no! on Proposition 99.''

In both examples the message's intention is clear. Using a standard that looks for specific words or phrases in a communication is called conducting a [[bright-line]] test. Bright-line is a standard if there is no mistake.  One or more of the "[[Eight Magic Words]]" or their {{clarify|reason=definition?|text=equivalents|date=March 2016}} is present or not present.  

Express advocacy is associated with [[independent expenditure]]s.

===History===
In the 1970s, changes to regulations permitted non-candidate organizations to make [[independent expenditure]]s and use their money in election season. They could neither give it directly to a candidate nor make advertisement on a candidates behalf.  Typical expenditures were described as being "party building" and [[get out the vote]] campaigns. Organizations, especially non-profits were supposed to do it on a [[nonpartisan]] basis. However, groups tended to focus efforts on signing up and getting the type of voters to the polls that were most likely to hold similar views.

The only barrier stopping a group from campaigning directly for their favorite candidate or cause was something called the "reasonable person" test: if a reasonable person, viewing the communication, comes to the conclusion the sponsor wants them to vote in one way, it is express advocacy, not interest advocacy.&lt;ref name="BlueRibbon"&gt;[http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm Governor’s Blue-Ribbon Commission on campaign finance reform for State of Wisconsin, Final Report, Section 5. Level the playing field, Promoting freedom of speech, paragraph 3-6, Chairman Donald F. Kettl, May 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209063419/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm |date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One problem with the reasonable person test is it is not definitive or a [[bright-line rule]].  There was no clear line that clearly stated if you cross this point you are on the wrong side. In an attempt to help the situation, in 1976 a footnote was included in a US Supreme Court ruling provided eight examples.&lt;ref name="BuckleyValeo"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Buckley v. Valeo |last=Smith |first=Craig R. |title=Free Speech on Trial: Communication Perspectives on Landmark Supreme Court Decisions |editor=Parker, Richard A. (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-1301-X |pages=203&amp;ndash;217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, rather than using them as examples, many found it easier to just leave out the "magic words" and claim their communications to voters were fine. By 1996, interest advocacy groups were spending millions of dollars on campaigns claiming their advertisements were "issue only" since they left out the "magic words."

By 2000, voters were inundated with $500 million worth of this type of advertisement.&lt;ref name="GWU"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~smpa/faculty/documents/Swift_Boat_Article_FALR_000.pdf Swift boat Vets in 2004: Press coverage of an independent campaign, First Amendment Law Review, University of North Carolina School of Law, Vol. 4, 2005, by Albert L. May, July 29, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the "shame issue ads," scandals, and the amount of spending, Congress held a congressional investigation.  It reinvigorated campaign finance reform, and led to the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] in 2002, which is more commonly known as McCain-Feingold.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|75}}

In 2003, in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'', the Court detailed the difference between interest versus express advocacy. It ruled looking for [[Eight Magic Words|"magic words"]] as "functionally meaningless" since an advertiser can communicate its intention to voters without them.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|15}} Therefore, instead of looking for words, the Court again ruled that if a communication to voters had  "no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for, or against, a specific candidate," it is "the functional equivalent of express advocacy."&lt;ref name="GSUlaw"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1878727 Has the tide turned in favor of disclosure? Revealing money in politics after Citizens United and Doe v. Reed, by Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Georgia State University Law Review, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2011, July 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1092}}

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], "issue only" ads continued and some famous ones were made by a group called [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat]].  They claimed their advertisements were issue only ads, not express advocacy. According to at least one analyst, voters voted exactly how the sponsors intended and the advertisements "torpedoed" [[Massachusetts]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/wyly-brothers-republican-campaign-donations_n_664550.html "Wyly Brothers Gave Millions To Over 200 Republican Candidates"], ''The Huffington Post'', Marcus Baram, July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a [[political action committee]] [[Progress of America]], ran an advertisement that showed the horrors of terrorism and stated that [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] want to kill American citizens. At the end, ot asked, "Would you trust Kerry against these killers?" "George Bush did not start this War, but he will end it." The "magic words" are missing.  

In 2007, the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' ruled that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election. The test to tell the difference between interest and express advocacy remained the [[reasonable person]] test.

However, that is said to have created a difficulty. A test that requires someone to consider how a [[reasonable person]] views a communication to voters requires someone to decide. The only definitive answer comes from a judge and that takes time. Election commissions are not judges, but they can issue [[advisory opinion]] on the matter. That led to a concern that in federal elections, that officials at the [[Federal Election Commission]] and state-level commissions would have to do work. Anyone cautious, wanting to make sure the communication to voters, was interest and not express advocacy would contact it for an opinion.  Communications to voters covers a wide range of areas including advertisements, e-mails, signs, and even speeches on the pulpit might want to ask someone.  

To resolve this issue, the [[US Supreme Court]] looked back at a prior ruling. In 1976, in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', the Supreme Court held that one thing of key importance was protecting free speech. 

In 2010, ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''  determined, among other things, that it would be basically not possible for the federal government to be in the business of determining what does and does not constitute issue advocacy or express advocacy.

==Disclosure requirements==
In 2010, ''Citizens United'' "expressly rejected the contention that election-law disclosure requirements are limited to express
advocacy or its functional equivalent." While it and a subsequent case affected certain spending limitations, it did not permit those making the spending from evading disclosure requirements by claiming they were performing issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1091-1092}}

Also in 2010 in a case known as ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to keep signatures upon a referendum from voters, based upon a claim it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Lower courts are already applying these new standards to uphold a gamut of state disclosure laws ranging from ballot measures to candidate elections, and from express advocacy to issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1103}}

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J.

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M.

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W.

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

{{Democracy}}

This is an incomplete list of wars between entities that have a [[constitution]]ally [[democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]] and actually practice it. Two points are required: that there has been a war, and that there are democracies on at least two opposing sides. For many of these entries, whether there has been a war, or a democracy, is a debatable question; all significant views should be given. For example, see [[list of types of democracy]].

==Definition dependence==
:''See also: [[List of types of democracy]], [[History of democracy]],  and [[Democratic peace theory]].''
Almost all of these depend on the definition of "democracy" (and of "war") employed. As James Lee Ray points out, with a sufficiently restrictive definition of democracy, there will be no wars between democracies: define democracy as true universal suffrage, the right of all – including children – to vote, and there have been no democracies, and so no wars between them.

On the other hand, Ray lists the following as having been called wars between democracies,  with broader definitions of democracy: The [[American Revolution]] including the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Belgian Revolution]], the [[Sonderbund War]], the war of 1849 between the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] and the [[Second French Republic]], the [[American Civil War]], the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[Second Philippine War]], the [[Second Boer War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]] (as a whole, and also the [[Continuation War]] by itself), the [[Israeli War of Independence]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]–1948, the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan War]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lee Ray: "Wars between democracies: Rare, or nonexistent?", ''International Interactions'' Volume 18, Issue 3 February 1993, pages 251–276; child suffrage and  from Ray, ''Democracy and International Conflict'' p.88. Restricted definitions of democracy can also be constructed which define away all wars between democracies, and yet include many regimes often held to be democratic; Ray finds this more rhetorically effective than saying that ''full-scale'' international war between ''established'' democracies with ''wide'' suffrage is less likely than between other pairs of states.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes also had democratic forms of government, and they often fought each other up until the late 19th century, as did many tribes of [[Norsemen]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Similarly, the school of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], founder of the [[Polity IV]] dataset, divides regimes into three classes: democracies, autocracies, and "[[Anocracy|anocracies]]"; the last being the sort of weak or new states which are marginal democracies or marginal autocracies; many of the wars below involve weak or marginal democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Ze'ev Maoz, Nasrin Abdolali, "Regime Types and International Conflict, 1816–1976", ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''  vol. 33, no. 1 (March 1986) pp. 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early democracy==

===Greek democracies===
{{See also|Athenian democracy}}
The [[Peloponnesian war]] included a great many conflicts among Greek city-states. The principal war was between Athens and her allies (most of them democracies) on one side, and Sparta and her allies (most of them oligarchies—although most of them held elections among a citizen body{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}) on the other. But the war lasted for twenty-seven years, with a brief armistice, and a great many side-conflicts occurred; and states changed from democracy to oligarchy and back again. Most notable of the wars between democracies was the [[Sicilian Expedition]], 415–413 BC, in which Athens went to war with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. [[Bruce Russett]] finds 13 conflicts between "clear" democratic pairs (most of these being Athens and allies in the Sicilian Expedition) and 25 involving "other" democratic pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Russett, ''Grasping the Democratic Peace'', p. 47–71; Russett, one of the few to consider the democratic peace before 1750, thinks it likely that the norm of interdemocratic peace developed gradually through the centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; Classicist [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] thinks one of Russett's examples unlikely, but adds several instances of wars between democracies before and after the Peloponnesian War.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen ''et al.'': ''An inventory of archaic and classical poleis'' (2005), p. 85 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Republic===
{{See also|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The constitution of the [[Roman Republic]], before its collapse in the late 1st century BC, is amply documented; its magistrates (including the [[Roman Senate]], which was composed of current and former magistrates) were elected by universal suffrage by adult (male) citizens; all male citizens were eligible. There was a political class of wealthy men; most successful candidates belonged to this class, and all of them were supported by a party drawn from it, but this does not distinguish Rome from other democracies—nor, indeed, from non-democratic states; freedom of speech was, however, a characteristic difference between the Republic and the later [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Roman Revolution'' (1939, repr. and revised 1962), including the view on the oligarchy behind ''all'' constitutions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;David Churchman, ''Why We Fight: Theories of Aggression and Human Conflict'', University Press of America (2005), p.143, who discusses Rome ''and'' Carthage.&lt;/ref&gt; The old constitution of Carthage, before the [[First Punic War]], was described by Aristotle as a mixture of democracy and oligarchy; after the disastrous end of that war, about 240&amp;nbsp;BC, there was a democratic change, the direct election of a pair of executives, and the [[Second Punic War]] was fought under that constitution; there continued to be an oligarchic party.  There were several further changes of party, and democratic reforms; the election of the democratic party, which favored a less passive foreign policy, in 151&amp;nbsp;BC provoked Rome to begin the [[Third Punic War]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel: ''History of Carthage'' (1993, Eng. tr. 1995) pp. 116–120, 411; Richard Miles ''"Carthage must be destroyed"'' (2010): 214, 318, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Babst. "Elective Governments — A Force For Peace." ''The Wisconsin Sociologist'' 3 (1, 1964): 9–14 (he writes of, and defines, ''freely elective governments'', but his papers have been taken as the founding of democratic peace theory, and cited as being about democracies); Raymond Cohen, "Pacific unions: a reappraisal of the theory that 'democracies do not go to war with each other'", ''Review of International Studies'' 20 (3, 1994) 207–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
* [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13): The [[Young Turks]] had re-established constitutional government in Ottoman Turkey in 1908, and continued to struggle for greater liberalization;&lt;ref&gt;Ayhat Kansu, ''Politics in post-revolutionary Turkey, 1908-1913'', passim&lt;/ref&gt; the "relatively democratic" Constitution of Serbia had been restored in 1903, and attained complete openness of executive recruitment. Serbia and its allies, the constitutional monarchies of Greece and Bulgaria, won the war; Turkey suffered a military coup as a result of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; pp. 210-11, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First World War]]: The Polity IV dataset does not rank any of the [[Central Powers]] as democracies, although the component of democracy for Germany had been higher than that of autocracy since the 1890s, when Bismarck was replaced by [[Leo von Caprivi]];&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; neither does the somewhat controversial&lt;ref&gt;Vanhanen calls his own methodology of ranking democracies approximate, and subject to short-term variation; others call it "unacceptable", and using "invalid" or "controversial" indicators; see Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p. 36,61. He primarily uses it to measure and compare long-term trends in the democracy of single countries, in which such fluctuations will cancel out.&lt;/ref&gt; ranking of [[Tatu Vanhanen]];&lt;ref&gt;Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p72&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, all of the Central Powers had elected parliaments; the Reichstag had been elected by universal suffrage, and voted on whether a credit essential to the German conduct of the war should be granted. Whether this is democratic control over the foreign policy of the Kaiser is "a difficult case"; [[Michael W. Doyle]] concludes, however, that the government was not absolutely dependent on the Reichstag - and that Germany was a [[dyarchy]], effectively a mixture of two different constitutions, and democratic on internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael W. (1983a). "Kant, Liberal Legacies, and Foreign Affairs". Philosophy and Public Affairs 12 (Vol. 12, No. 3. (Summer, 1983)): p216&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polish–Lithuanian War]]: Fought in 1920, with about 1000 estimated battle deaths. In both states, elections had been held with universal suffrage. In the polity scale, Poland received a +8 rating in combined democracy/autocracy in 1920, while Lithuania received a +7 in democracy and a +4 in combined democracy/autocracy.&lt;ref name="PIVP"/&gt; The conflict is seen by both Polish and Lithuanian historians as a part of the wars of independence from the Soviet Union.
* [[Continuation War]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = Melvin | last2 = Singer | first2 = David J. | year = 1976 | title = The War Proneness of Democratic Regimes, 1816-1965 | url = | journal = Jerusalem Journal of International Relations | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 50–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal state of war between the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], on one side, and [[Finland]] on the other, resulting from the Soviet Union bombing of Finland in 1941; there was actual conflict between the United Kingdom and Finland, including [[Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo|an air raid against Finnish territory]], with associated attacks on Finnish shipping, although that took place some months before the declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gleditsch, Nils P. | title=Democracy and Peace | journal=Journal of Peace Research | year=1992 |volume=29 | pages= 369–376| doi=10.1177/0022343392029004001 |issue=4 | ref=harv | jstor=425538}}; Wayman, Frank (2002). "Incidence of Militarized Disputes Between Liberal States, 1816-1992". Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, New Orleans, La., March 23–27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Israeli War of Independence]]: as against Lebanon; Israel had not yet held elections.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Russett, ''Controlling the Sword: the Democratic Governance of National Security'' (1990), p.123: "the nearest exception"; Russett notes that Singer and Small (see note on the Continuation war) do not count Israel as yet being a democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Kashmir War]]: Ranked as a full-scale war between democracies in the International Crisis Behavior dataset;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ray, Democracy and International Conflict p.120&lt;/ref&gt; they present a table of crises ranking it as a full-scale war, cite it as an example of a crisis where both regimes were of the same type, and discuss the influence of India's democracy on the crisis and the related crises over other princely states.&lt;ref&gt;Brecher, Wilkenfeld, and Moser, ''Crises in the Twentieth Century'', I, 129, 122, 209-10; they do not generally disaggregate the differences in regime type (democracy, civil authoritarianism, or military government) in each pair of states from other differences between states, and differences between other states in the same crisis. For a briefer discussion of the emerging democracy of India and the ultimately unsuccessful democracy of the Dominion of Pakistan, see Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; pp. 241-2.&lt;/ref&gt; There were fewer than a thousand battlefield casualties in this war.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Both countries, then Dominions, then had governments based on the [[Government of India Act 1935]], implemented 1937, which set up [[Westminster democracy]] for all of British India;&lt;ref&gt;Imtiaz Omar: ''Emergency powers and the courts in India and Pakistan'', 2002, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; in Pakistan, the politicians, at odds with the civilian bureaucracy, failed to maintain civilian control over the military, and converted the Governor-Generalship into a political office; there was a military coup ten years after the war; the Polity IV dataset counts it as anocratic until 1957-8 (see [[#Definition dependence|above]]), the years before the coup; the same dataset shows India as having been a stable democracy throughout the period.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of India'', Volume IV, part 1, ''Politics of India since independence'', p. 61; for more discussion of the destruction of Pakistan's first democracy, see Ian Talbot: ''A short history of Pakistan'', chapter 5, which cites the detailed history of the period, Allan McGrath, ''The Destruction of Pakistan's Democracy (1998).

In [[philosophy]], '''meta-rights''' are the [[entitlement]]s of individuals to their [[rights]], including the possibility to [[waive]], transfer or sell their rights. When we talk of the rights of individuals, we do not always distinguish between rights which can be waived or sold and rights which are non-negotiable. Yet that distinction and often the distinction is made implicitly. When we say a person has a right to her house, we usually mean that she also has the meta right to sell the right. On the other hand, when we say a person has the right to his body parts, we usually assume this comes without the accompanying meta right to sell these rights. Economic efficiency usually comes with having rights which come together with the meta right to sell the right. It is arguable that we should be much more explicit about when rights come together with meta rights and when without, and the moral basis that accompany these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaushik Basu |title=The right to give up rights |journal=Economica |volume=51 |year=1984|doi=10.2307/2554226 |jstor=2554226 |pages=413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/basic-rights-and-meta-rights#axzz2SSpJJAeL&lt;/ref&gt;

[[József Antall]], a historian and [[Christian democracy|Christian democrat]] who served as the first post-communist [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] of [[Hungary]], described national liberalism as "part and parcel of the emergence of the nation state" in 19th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="ÖzselReflections"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Özsel|first1=Doğancan|title=Reflections on Conservatism|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=1443833959|page=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uh0rBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=%22national+liberalism%22++++Antall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a21Wz9wqee&amp;sig=WjLCWGwjysWKjKqeE2fRqBqy84A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ_-bEkPPTAhWH3SYKHUOjDuwQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22national%20liberalism%22%20%20%20%20Antall&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Oskar Mulej, "in terms of both ideologies and political party traditions it may be argued that in the [[Central Europe]]an lands a distinct type of liberalism, peculiar to this region evolved through the nineteenth century"&lt;ref name="Mulej"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Oskar Mulej|title=NATIONAL LIBERALS AND THEIR PROGENY APPROACHING THE PECULIAR DEVELOPMENTS IN CENTRAL EUROPEAN LIBERAL PARTY TRADITIONS, 1867–1918|url=http://rcin.org.pl/Content/56895/WA303_77550_A295-APH-R-111_Mulej.pdf|website=rcin.org.pl|publisher=Acta Poloniae Historica 111, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and citing Maciej Janowski, "the word 'national' acted as more or less synonymous with 'liberal'" ("'national' alone was sufficient to arouse suspicions of liberal associations").&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Janowski, ‘ Wavering Friendship : liberal and national ideas in nineteenth  century East-Central Europe’, Ab Imperio , 3–4 (2000), 69–90, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Mulej, in [[Southeast Europe]] "'national liberals' also played visible if not central roles, but with rather different, region-specific characteristics, which to a considerable extent distinguished them from their Central European counterparts".&lt;ref name="Mulej"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oskar Mulej |url=http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xxxiii/national-liberal-heirs-of-the-old-austria |title=National Liberal Heirs of the Old Austria: “Deviations” in Liberal Party Traditions, 1867-1918 &amp;#124; IWM |publisher=Institute for Human Sciences |website=iwm.at |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Up From Conservatism,'' [[Michael Lind]] defines "national liberalism" in a way that ''[[The Progressive]]'' describes as matching [[historian]] [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]]'s use of the expression "[[Vital Center]]".&lt;ref name="HarveyWobbling"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Kaye|title=Wobbling around the center|url=http://search.proquest.com/news/docview/231946192/fulltextPDF/AF05AF9F5275407APQ/2?accountid=10226|accessdate=16 May 2017|publisher=[[The Progressive]]|date=October 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind himself defines "national liberalism" as uniting "moderate social conservatism with moderate economic liberalism".&lt;ref name="LindUpFrom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lind|first1=Michael|title=Up from Conservatism|date=2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1476761159|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeEeAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22national+liberalism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR0-TmnvTTAhWFRiYKHfbHCf4Q6AEITTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22national%20liberalism%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Smith (academic)|Gordon Smith]], a leading scholar of comparative European politics, understands national liberalism as a political concept that lost popularity when the success of nationalist movements in creating nation states rendered it no longer necessary to specify that a liberal ideal, party or politician was "national".&lt;ref name=SmithLiberalism&gt;"Between Left and Right: The Ambivalence of European Liberalism," pp. 16–28, in ''Liberal Parties in Western Europe,'' Emil J. Kirchner, ed., Cambridge University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|0521323940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The roots of national liberalism are to be found in the 19th century, when [[conservative liberalism]] and/or [[classical liberalism]] was the ideology of the political classes in most [[Europe]]an countries and in particular those of [[Central Europe]], then governed by hereditary [[monarchy|monarchies]].

At their origin, national liberals, although pro-business, were not necessarily advocates of [[free trade]] and [[economic liberalism]] per se and sometimes favoured cooperation between the government and the national industry, moderate levels of protectionism, the establishment of preferential custom unions, subsidies for infant industry or companies considered of national strategic importance and various forms of industrial planning.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

National liberalism was popular in a number of countries including [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Romania]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Kuunmaki&gt;Kurunmaki, Jussi. “On the Difficulty of Being a National Liberal in Nineteenth-Century Finland.” Contributions to the History of Concepts, vol. 8, no. 2, 2013, pp. 83–95., https://www.jstor.org/stable/43610946.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2017}} In Germany, Austria and Romania, national liberals and/or "National Liberal" parties were long in government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} More specifically, in [[German language|German-speaking]] countries national liberals were also in favour of a more authoritarian or conservative political regime because of the multi-ethnic character or heterogeneous nature of countries like the [[Austrian Empire]] (later officially renamed [[Austria-Hungary]]) or the newly created Germany under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Germany===
In 19th-century Germany, believers in national liberalism differed from [[civic nationalism|liberal nationalists]] in that they believed in a more authoritarian presence in Europe and a strong [[German Empire]]. Liberal nationalists, such as [[Max Weber]], were looking towards a democratic Germany in cooperation with the other European powers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

At the time of the German Empire, national liberalism was represented by the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] (NLP), the largest in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] for several years. National Liberals supported Bismarck, who served as Chancellor from 1871 ([[unification of Germany]]) to 1890, until the late 1870s when the Chancellor reversed his early [[free trade]] policies, became a proponent of [[protectionism]], opposed increasing parliamentary powers and ultimately pandered for the support of the [[German Conservative Party]] (largely representing the wealthy landowning elite [[Junker (Prussia)|Junkers]] of [[Prussia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Alan|title=My Revision Notes: Edexcel A-level History: Germany, 1871-1990: united, divided and reunited|date=2017|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=9781471876653|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=UUo_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=%22national+liberals%22+protectionism+bismarck&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QtOHZbTyiO&amp;sig=n16Uv7oUubm8kiqRPz-_x6nD5fE&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrb6W7PTUAhVOLFAKHaeUCZsQ6AEIXDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22national%20liberals%22%20protectionism%20bismarck&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John F.|title=At the Threshold of Dissolution: The National Liberals and Bismarck 1877/1878|jstor=2639216|journal=The Historical Journal|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/31.htm |title=Germany - The Tariff Agreement of 1879 |website=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/31.htm |title=Germany - The Tariff Agreement of 1879 |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the NLP (which had obtained around 30% in the first three federal elections, including 30.1% in the [[German federal election, 1871|1871 federal election]]) suffered huge losses in the [[German federal election, 1878|1878 federal election]] and especially the [[German federal election, 1881|1881 federal election]] (when it was reduced to 14.6%). Later, the party experienced a steady decline in its share of vote, contextually with the rise of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] at the turn of the century.

During the [[Weimar Republic]], the NLP was succeeded by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), whose main leader was [[Gustav Stresemann]], Chancellor (1923) and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1923–1929). The DVP, which was joined by some moderate elements of the [[Free Conservative Party]] (FKP) and the [[Economic Union (political party)|Economic Union]] (WV),&lt;ref name=VM&gt;Vincent E McHale (1983) ''Political parties of Europe'', Greenwood Press, p421 {{ISBN|0-313-23804-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was generally thought to represent the interests of the great German industrialists and has been classified as a national-liberal party by several observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jürgen |last=Dittberner |title=Sozialer Liberalismus: Ein Plädoyer |publisher=Logos |year=2008 |pages=55, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Wolfgang (ed.) |last=Neugebauer |title=Handbuch der Preussischen Geschichte |volume=3 |publisher=de Gruyter |year=2000 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Liesbeth |last=Van De Grift |title=Securing the Communist State: The Reconstruction of Coercive Institutions in the Soviet Zone of Germany and Romania, 1944-48 |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2012 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its platform stressed Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies and hostility to "[[Marxism]]" (that is to say, both the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and the Social Democratic Party). After Stresemann's death, the DVP, whose ranks included several anti-republicans, veered sharply to the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

The current [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), which was the joint successor of the DVP and the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), originally featured conservative and partly nationalist efforts, which were particularly strong in some state associations until the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Gert-Joachim Glaeßner: Politik in Deutschland, VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften 2006, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; and more occasionally after that (an interesting example is that of [[Jürgen Möllemann]], FDP leader in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in 1983–1994 and 1996–2002)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20The%20Politics%20of%20the%20Nazi%20Past%20in%20Germany%20and%20Austria.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and still includes a national-liberal faction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liberal Parties in Western Europe |last=Kirchner |first=Emil Joseph |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge |location=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-32394-9 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IrE08SV1wEC |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds a consistently [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] position, differently from the rest of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taggart |first1=Paul |last2=Szczerbiak |first2=Aleks |title=The Party Politics of Euroscepticism in EU Member and Candidate States |series=SEI Working Paper |volume=51 |page=11 |publisher=Sussex European Institute |doi= |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp51.pdf |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210232136/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/wp51.pdf |archivedate=10 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some right-wing elements, including Sven Tritschler (former leader of the Stresemann Club),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rechtsliberale.wordpress.com/personen |title=Wir &amp;#124; Stresemann Club - Rechtsliberale in der FDP |website=Rechtsliberale.wordpress.com |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more recently joined the [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/westpol/sendungen/afd-nrw-steckbriefe-100.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235510/http://www1.wdr.de/fernsehen/westpol/sendungen/afd-nrw-steckbriefe-100.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has in turn been characterised by some observers as national liberal.&lt;ref name="Franzmann2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Franzmann|editor1=Gabriele D'Ottavio|editor2=Thomas Saalfeld|title=Germany After the 2013 Elections: Breaking the Mould of Post-Unification Politics?|chapter=The Failed Struggle for Office Instead of Votes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mLBCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|year=2015|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4724-4439-4|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.freitag.de/autoren/idefix/die-populistische-versuchung |title=AfD ǀ Die populistische Versuchung — der Freitag |language=de|publisher=Freitag.de |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/patzelt-sachsen-landtagswahl-100.html |title=Politologe analysiert Landtagswahl: "Den Sachsen geht es zu gut" |website=tagesschau.de |date=2014-09-01 |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Constitutional Party (Austria)|Constitutional Party]] was the main representative of national liberalism.&lt;ref name="Mulej"/&gt; In [[Austria]], national liberalism has remained the basis of one of the three ''Lager'', or ideological camps, in the country, dating back to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The new politics of the Right: neo-Populist parties and movements in established democracies |editor1-first=Hans-Georg |editor1-last=Betz |editor2-first=Stefan |editor2-last=Immerfall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9cGkDJgW7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=1998 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-21338-1 |chapter=The Freedom Party of Austria: From Protest to Radical Right Populism |first=Max |last=Riedlsperger |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[interwar period]], the national-liberal camp was gathered into the [[Greater German People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6DURCH53f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Modern+Austria#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Barbara |last=Jelavich |title=Modern Austria: Empire and Republic, 1815-1986 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1987 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, with the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria into [[Nazi Germany]], the national-liberal camp had been swallowed whole by [[Austrian National Socialism]] and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="R28"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The new politics of the Right: neo-Populist parties and movements in established democracies |editor1-first=Hans-Georg |editor1-last=Betz |editor2-first=Stefan |editor2-last=Immerfall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9cGkDJgW7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=1998 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-21338-1 |chapter=The Freedom Party of Austria: From Protest to Radical Right Populism |first=Max |last=Riedlsperger |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime and the national-liberal camp was scarred after the war due to [[association fallacy|guilt by association]] with National Socialism.&lt;ref name="R28"/&gt;

In 1949, the [[Federation of Independents]] (VdU) was founded as a national-liberal alternative to the main Austrian parties.&lt;ref name="M186"&gt;{{Cite book |format=PhD thesis |url=http://vbn.aau.dk/files/20049801/spirit_phd_series_25.pdf |last=Meret |first=Susi |year=2010 |title=The Danish People’s Party, the Italian Northern League and the Austrian Freedom Party in a Comparative Perspective: Party Ideology and Electoral Support |series=SPIRIT PhD Series |publisher=[[University of Aalborg]] |volume=25 |issn=1903-7783|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporated an array of political movements, including free market liberals, populists, former Nazis and German nationalists, all of whom had been unable to join either of the two main parties.&lt;ref name="M186"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The politics of exclusion: debating migration in Austria|last1=Krzyżanowski|first1=Michał|last2=Wodak|first2=Ruth|year=2009|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3qXaV9EYREC&amp;dq=|publisher=Transaction|isbn=978-1-4128-0836-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cb&gt;{{cite book|title=World fascism: a historical encyclopedia|volume=1|last=Blamires|first=Cypriam|year=2006|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C&amp;dq|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-940-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VdU evolved into the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) in 1955–1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional law of 15 EU member states|first1=L. |last1=Prakke|first2=C.

Haider himself would split from the party and form the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] in 2005.

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], from the 1840s the core concept of national liberalism was that the nation and the state should have the same extent. National liberals supported the union the Kingdom of Denmark and the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] under a common constitutional framework. On the economy, the state should not interfere with trade and the national-liberal economic vision was transposed in the 1857 Law on Freedom of Business, which abolished the last remnants of the feudal monopolies which had previously formed the framework for the craft of the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/nationalliberalisme |title=Nationalliberalisme |website=Danmarkshistorien.dk |publisher=Aarhus Universitet |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish national liberals supported [[Scandinavism]] and thus Scandinavian unity.&lt;ref name="Hilson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Hilson|chapter=Denmark, Norway, and Sweden|editor1=Timothy Baycroft|editor2=Mark Hewitson|title=What Is a Nation?: Europe 1789-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLYUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|year= 2006|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-929575-3|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], in the 1860s liberals described themselves as national liberals (''nationalliberaler'') and constituted a coalition of monarchists and liberal reformists in support of parliamentary reforms.&lt;ref name=Kuunmaki/&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2017}} Swedish national liberals also supported Scandinavism.&lt;ref name="Hilson"/&gt;

===Finland===
In the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], an [[autonomous entity|autonomous]] part of the [[Russian Empire]], where as many as 80% of the population was Protestant and Finnish-speaking, somewhat under 20% Protestant Swedish speakers (Sweden ruled Finland until 1809) and a small number Russian Orthodox, the term "national liberal" was used by the elite Swedish-speakers of the [[Svecoman movement]] who advocated liberal ideals, but wanted to keep Swedish as the dominant language, an idea opposed by Finnish-speaking nationalists of the [[Fennoman movement]].&lt;ref name=Kuunmaki/&gt;{{verification needed|date=May 2017}} The Svecoman movement gave birth to the Swedish Party, which was later renamed [[Swedish People's Party in Finland]], which has since moved to mainstream liberalism and [[social liberalism]] and is often a party of government in the country.

===Russia===
In [[Russia]], "national liberalism" was a 1990s movement claiming to be redefining "liberal" principles as understood in the Western tradition to produce a "national liberalism" better suited to Russian culture,&lt;ref name="EvansEdinburghCompanion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Mark|title=The Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism|date=2001|publisher=PsychologyPress|isbn=1579583393|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; being practically a variety of [[Russian nationalism]].

Presidential candidate in [[Russian presidential election, 2018|2018 presidential election]], [[Ksenia Sobchak]] of [[Civic Initiative]], considers herself a national liberal.

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), founded in 1875, revived in 1990 and enlarged in 2014 (when it absorbed the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]], PDL), has also been part of the national-liberal tradition. Today, it is one of the country's two main parties. President [[Klaus Iohannis]] hails from it. The PNL is now mainly [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-Europeanist]] placed on the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] of the [[political spectrum]] concerning economy, society, culture, freedom of expression and civil liberties.

===Slovakia===
[[Freedom and Solidarity]] (SaS), the [[Liberalism|liberal]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/slovakia.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[libertarianism|libertarian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=yctgCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT726&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Routledge Handbook of European Elections] edited by Donatella M. Viola, Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; main opposition party after the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]] in [[Slovakia]], has been shifting from liberalism to [[Euroscepticism]] and [[nationalism]] and/or combining liberalism and nationalism. As a fact, SaS is not a member of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]], but of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], along with conservative and Eurosceptic parties. SaS leader [[Richard Sulík]] described himself both as a liberal and as a nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Richard Sulík: Áno, som slovenský nacionalista|url=https://dennikn.sk/688253/richard-sulik-sas-som-slovensky-nacionalista-rozhovor/|journal=Dennik N|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later corrected himself by saying that he was a liberal and a [[patriotism|patriot]] while condemning [[chauvinism]], [[racism]] and [[religious fanaticism]] and opposing the withdrawal of Slovakia from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dennikn.sk/690096/som-slovensky-liberal/|title=Som slovenský liberál|last=Sulík|first=Richard|work=Denník N|access-date=2017-10-16|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party has never been classified as national-liberal by third-party sources.

===Czech Republic===
In [[Austria-Hungary]] the [[Young Czech Party]], emerged in 1874 after a split from the [[Old Czech Party]], was a national-liberal force. During [[Czechoslovakia]]'s era (1918–1992), a few parties were described as national-liberal: [[Czechoslovak National Democracy]], the [[National Labour Party (1925)|National Labour Party]] and, after 1989, the [[Czech National Social Party]].

Today, the conservative [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS) in the [[Czech Republic]] has been described as a national-liberal party.&lt;ref name="NaglePerspective"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagle|first1=John|title=Democracy and Democratization: Post-Communist Europe in Comparative Perspective|date=1999|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0761956794|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLRuXV9vjswC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22national+liberalism%22++rights+democratic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2vIHM5PbTAhWG6yYKHYADCyMQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22national%20liberalism%22%20%20rights%20democratic&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ODS is a member of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe]], as [[Slovakia]]'s [[Freedom and Solidarity]], and the [[International Democrat Union]].

'''''Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali''''' is a 1980 book written by [[anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geertz argues that the pre-colonial Balinese state was not a "[[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic bureaucracy]]" nor an [[oriental despotism]], but rather, an organized spectacle. The noble rulers of the island were less interested in administering the lives of the Balinese than in dramatizing their rank and hence political superiority through large public rituals and ceremonies. These cultural processes did not support the state, he argues, but ''were'' the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=13–17, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps most clear in what was, after all, the master image of political life: kingship. The whole of the negara - court life, the traditions that organized it, the extractions that supported it, the privileges that accompanied it - was essentially directed toward defining what power was; and what power was what kings were. Particular kings came and went, 'poor passing facts' anonymized in titles, immobilized in ritual, and annihilated in bonfires. But what they represented, the model-and-copy conception of order, remained unaltered, at least over the period we know much about. The driving aim of higher politics was to construct a state by constructing a king. The more consummate the king, the more exemplary the centre. The more exemplary the centre, the more actual the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geertz used the Balinese case to develop an abstract model of the [[Theatre state]] applicable to all the South East Asian Indic polities. To succinctly summarize his theory, "Power served pomp, not pomp power." Other anthropologists have contested the ahistorical, static nature of the model. They point out that he has depoliticized a political institution by emphasizing culture while ignoring its material base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=393–413|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Clifford Geertz was an American anthropologist who is remembered for his influence on the practice of [[symbolic anthropology]], and who was considered "for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, Shweder, R. A., &amp; Good, B. (2005). Clifford Geertz by his colleagues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz used this model to provide "an alternate conception of what politics is about"; to advance an approach to history as a succession of broad cultural schemata; and to contribute to the cultural dimension of the discussion on Southeast Asian polities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is a consideration of many elements of Balinese life, such as cremation ceremonies, that many would not consider a part of a state apparatus. In order to understand why cremation ceremonies should be so key to the "Theatre state" Geertz provides a detailed description of Balinese social organization [[Ethnography|in its own cultural terms]]. Particular aspects of Balinese life have been over-emphasized, according to some, to accommodate his model. Those aspects focus, in particular, on the role of irrigation.

===The Ruling Class===
For most of the nineteenth century, there were seven principal kingdoms, of which Klungkung was considered the oldest and most sacred. The others were Tabanan, Badung, Gianyar, Karengasem, Bangli, and Mengwi. They were primarily located on the plain on the south side of the island. Each of the kingdoms  controlled a riverine valley and hence the water supply required for rice irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdoms of Bali were said to have been founded by Javanese refugees from the Hinduized kingdom of [[Majapahit]] which had just fallen to Muslim invaders. They, in turn, invaded in 1352 at Gelgel and established an Indic state based upon the caste system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=14–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The caste system====
The caste system only loosely resembled the caste system in India. The three noble castes were referred to as "''triwangsa''," (three peoples), the "insiders" (''wong jero'') as opposed to the commoners (''wong jaba'', outsiders).&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacRae argues that this emphasis on the Indic heritage of Bali is overdrawn, and points out that Geertz himself admits that caste is a misnomer in Bali, and "that the Indic surface  of Balinese political institutions has acted to inhibit a comparative reference eastwards... towards the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=398|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dadia====
The basic unit of the triwangsa castes was the "noble house" or dadia. The commoners, for the most part, lacked these corporate kin groups.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p26-27" /&gt; The dadia was a kinship group whose leadership passed through the line of the eldest male, from father to son. Younger sons remained identified with the group, lived nearby, but had less status. The children of the core line also had more status than the children of the junior lines. Geertz refers to this as the principle of "sinking status." Each of these junior lines could potentially sever itself and form an independent dadia. This process of schism formed the internal politics within the royal houses, as distinct from political conflict between houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status differentials both within and between houses made patron-client relations the basic idiom of politics. These client relationships were especially important between castes, linking the priestly caste (''padanda'') with noble houses in a teacher-disciple tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these patron-client ties within dadia, alliances also formed between dadia in different kingdoms. These alliances were frequently codified in treaties, although the issues they covered seemed "designed more to codify the pretexts upon which alliances could be broken than to establish the bases upon which they could be built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Village and the State===
[[File:Bali temple diagram.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of a Balinese temple]]
[[File:PuraDalemSidan.jpg|thumbnail|Pura Dalem Sidan (temple)]]

The Balinese ruling classes seemed fragmented, internally torn by intrigues within dadia, and weakly allied between kingdoms. This poor political integration was aggravated by the political independence of the villages under royal dadia rule. The Balinese state was composed of institutions that cross-cut villages. Villages were not independent, self-contained "village republics" but were cross-cut by membership in three separate locally based political institutions that organized local life: the hamlet (''banjar''), the irrigation society (''subak''), and the temple congregation (''pemaksan''). Villages were also crosscut by tax obligations to different lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The village (''banjar'')====
The Balinese village has been falsely described in the colonial literature as a "village republic", bounded, self-contained and wholly autonomous. According to Geertz, an important part of this book was to disrupt colonial images of the closed corporate village. Geertz emphasizes that the village controlled only certain aspects of the everyday life of Balinese villagers, and that the tax and temple systems cross-cut village membership. That is, the members of a single village might pay taxes through several ''perbekel'' and be part of different temple congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village did have a constitution, which spelled out its members responsibilities for road making, upkeep of public facilities, night watch, and settlement of civil disputes. The village had its own leadership (''klian banjar''). This range of duties led Geertz to conclude "In brief, perhaps the bulk (though as we shall see, far from the whole) of Balinese government, in the strict sense of authoritative regulation of social life, was carried out by the hamlet, leaving the state free to dramatize power rather than to administer it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The temple congregation (''pemaksan'')====
Although focused on religious rites, the pemaksan was a corporate public body that was also an agency of government because of the link between religion and custom, i.e. forms of worship and social behaviour in Bali. Such religious rites were considered "adat" (custom), "the entire framework of social action in which both men and gods are enclosed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of small variations in adat defined the boundaries between pemaksan. The pemaksan thus stands as the moral community, next to the civil community embodied in the hamlet and the economic community in the irrigation society. The pemaksan will draw on one to ten villages for its members.

The pemaksan will maintain the "Three Great Temples" (''Kahyangan Tiga''): 1) the Origin Temple (''Pura Puseh'') which commemorates the human settlement of the area. 2) The Death Temple (''Pura Dalem'') used to pacify the not yet cremated and hence dangerous dead. And 3) the Great Council Temple (''Pura Balai Agung'') for ensuring the overall fertility of the pemaksan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irrigation system (''Subak'')====
[[File:1 Tegalalang rice terrace ubud bali.jpg|left|thumb|[[Subak (irrigation)|Subak]] irrigation system]]

According to Geertz, one of the most important of state institutions in Bali is the irrigation society (''subak'') given the theoretical emphasis placed upon irrigation in the materialist models of the "[[Asiatic mode of production]]." These models viewed the control of irrigation by lords as the major means of also controlling the population that depended on those irrigation works for their sustenance. Geertz views the subak as an autonomous organization separate from the state, much like the banjar. The system of dams, dikes and canals were the property of the subak, and hence controlled by the farmers themselves. Geertz thus dismisses any notion of "primitive communism" - and its spectre, "state capitalism."&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subak controls the water flowing from a single up-river dam. The water flows through its rice terraces to other subaks farther downstream. Once water flowed into a subak it was divided through a series of weirs so that each farmer would get the amount of water they needed at the right time. The regulation of water is thus a serious issue, and encounters regular bottlenecks where control of the supply for a whole subak can be seized. Controlling the complex flow of water within a subak was accomplished through a highly regimented series of rituals. Water temples placed at points of water division would coordinate the flow of water through carefully timed rituals. Geertz emphasizes that there is no central control of the timing of these rituals, and hence that the state is not an "oriental despotism" controlling the population through the control of water.&lt;ref name="Geertz-p69" /&gt;

[[File:Bali panorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Balinese rice terraces is part of Subak irrigation system.]]

It is Geertz's characterization of the irrigation system as headless that has attracted critique. Stephen Lansing's examination of Balinese irrigation shows that the need for effective water management links thousands of farmers in clear hierarchies, beginning with the most sacred temples dedicated to the Goddess of the volcanic Crater Lake ([[Mount Agung]]) that all Balinese hold sacred, and descending into the plains and low-lying rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansing|first=Stephen|title=Priests and Programmers: technologies of power in the engineered landscape of Bali|year=1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on nineteenth century Balinese records, Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin has shown that regional lords and kings played a large role in managing irrigation, and that this role was lost only in the Dutch colonial period. She argues that Geertz's failure to see the larger state role in water management reflects this change in colonial practice, thereby weakening the "theatre state" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser-Schaublin|first=Brigitta|title=Temple and King: Resource Management, Rituals and Redistribution in Early Bali |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute|year=2005|volume=11|issue=4|pages=747–71|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00260.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Perbekel system ====
The free, land-owning ''kawulas'' made up 90% of the population. Kawulas were attached to a perbekel, a "political foreman" to whom they owed specific obligations and taxes. The perbekels were attached to punggawas, the lords of dadia. Unlike the village, none of these political roles was based upon territorial residence. In other words, membership in the village was cross-cut by obligations to different perbekels and their lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bali was thus not a feudal realm where lords controlled land and people within a fiefdom. Lords and kawulas owned their own land, and lords did not generally seek their kawulas as tenants on their land. Kawulas had only two obligations to their perbekels: ritual service and military support: "He was a stagehand, spear carrier, and [[claqueur]] in an endless political opera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Although Bali lies along major Indonesian trade roots in the north, its mountainous geography orients it to the south; its only navigable port was at Kuta, on a southern peninsula. The bulk of trade remained in foreign hands, including the Chinese, [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]] and Europeans. Foreigners were largely restricted to these insulated ports of trade. Trade within Bali occurred in rotating markets characterized by traditional fixed exchange rates. Goods and services were also circulated through large scale [[Redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistributive]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of international trade was leased out by the king to a ''subandar'' (harbour master), who served as an intermediary between the traders and the dadia of the royal house, to whom he paid the rent. This rent was paid to each Lord of the royal house whenever they held a ceremony. The more ceremonies held, the greater share a Lord would receive of the spoils of trade. The point of trade then, was to hold larger spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectacle and political power===
[[File:Ubud Cremation 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|Balinese Cremation tower]]

Geertz argues that state ceremonials in the Negara were "metaphysical theatre"; that is, theatre designed to express a vision of the ultimate nature of reality that at the same time tried to shape current conditions to match that reality. Ritual events all re-created social relations of jero ("inner", to whom one surrendered power in the ritual event thereby making them powerful) and jaba ("outer", a provider of services to those who are jero) between lords and their kawula. Every ritual performance reproduced jero-jaba relations as both symbolic ideal and pragmatic reality, thereby reinforcing social order. Thus, although the state was cross-cut by the conflicting jurisdictions of temples, hamlets, and irrigation societies, they all come together  for mass state rituals in which the ideal social order of the state is made real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of the cremation ceremony====
The cremation ceremony was the largest and most ostentatious of the state rituals, attended by all the political dependants of a lord. At the centre of the ritual was the cremation tower (badé) on which the body of the deceased lord rested in state until the whole was consumed in fire. The cremation tower itself symbolized the cosmic order the ritual sought to make real. At its base were the world of demons (winged serpents), above which stood a platform called the House, representing the world of man. Above that were the tiers of roofs symbolizing the world of the gods, to which the deceased was ascending; a commoner would ascend to the first heaven (1 tier), whereas a king to the eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While having an eleven storey tower was iconic of regal status, accomplishing a cremation ritual was an accomplishment - a struggle - that justified that status. The first part of the ceremony, for example, involved transporting the tower in a procession to the cremation ground, a mob scene involving thousands; some of these carried the bier forward, while others tried to stop it. The struggle could potentially prevent those who lacked the status and resources from making what others felt were false claims; the scene "was a bit like a playful riot - a deliberated, even studied, violence, designed to set off a no less deliberated and even more studied stillness, which the variously imperturbable priests, agnates, widows and tributary dead contrived to gather about the central tower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|year=1980|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and critique of the book==
[[File:Southeast Asian Historical Mandalas.svg|thumb|right|Notable mandala states in [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian history]] (circa 5th to 15th century). From north to south; [[Pagan Kingdom|Bagan]], [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Champa]], [[Khmer empire|Angkor]], [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]].]]
Although Geertz considered this the pinnacle of his thinking on politics and history, reactions to the book have been mixed, "combining admiration for its scope and ambition with scepticism about its claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=394|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of the scepticism is that the book is clearly not a history of a specific polity, but a generalized ideal-type model intended to guide representations of the Southeast Asian Indic states found in [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] in the fifth to fifteenth centuries. As such, it is one of several models, such as that of O.W. Wolters "[[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]]" model, or [[Stanley Tambiah]]'s model of the "Galactic polity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Tony|title=Fluid Iron: State formation in Southeast Asia|year=2002|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geertz made it clear that his emphasis was a general model of the "theatre state" and not a specific Balinese kingdom by referring to the Balinese state with the Indic term Negara, whereas the Balinese refer to their pre-colonial state as a ''kerajaan''. As such, it over-estimates the Indic influence on Bali, and under-estimates its similarities with Polynesian kingdoms in [[Tahiti]], [[Samoa]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|pages=398–403|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of the book have focused on:

1) As a culturalist approach to history, it is remarkably static and ahistorical. [[Fredrik Barth]] argued that it "depoliticized" a political institution as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|title=Balinese worlds|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) By subordinating power to culture, the book ignores the material base of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|pages=445–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Geertz's book was published, several other historical studies of particular kingdoms have appeared which emphasize the more conventional political economic forms of power underlying the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacRae|first=Graeme|title=Negara Ubud: The Theatre-state in Twenty-first-century Bali|journal=History and Anthropology|year=2005|volume=16|issue=4|page=395|doi=10.1080/02757200500344616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3) Geertz makes the ritual aspect of Balinese culture "more exotic, more extraordinary and more other than the evidence warrants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Leo|title=Rice, ideology and the legitimation of hierarchy in Bali|journal=Man|year=1991|volume=26|issue=4|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4) Tambiah notes that Geertz presents the Balinese kings as, at once, the focus of ritual theatre that creates the exemplary centre as a still point, "immobilized into passivity and reflective trances" yet at the same time "Rent by virtually continuous intrigue, dispute, violence and an enormous amount of micro-upheaval."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|pages=320–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his best effort, Geertz does not transcend the break between expressive and instrumental action, or between power as pomp and power as control of people and resources.  He thus leaves himself open to Marxist critiques that view the state as a mystification, an "illusory representation of the unity of the village communities (as Marx put it in his sketch of 'oriental despotism'), and that the ceremonies of state are nothing but the spiritualizing of material interests and the covering up of material conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tambiah|first=Stanley|title=Culture, Thought, and Social Action: An Anthropological Perspective|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge MA|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">The ''' New Man ''' is a [[utopia]]n concept that involves the creation of a new ideal human being or [[citizen]] replacing un-ideal human beings or citizens. The meaning of a New Man has widely varied and various alternatives have been suggested by a variety of religions and political ideologies, including [[Christianity]], [[communism]], [[classical liberalism]], [[fascism]], and [[utopian socialism]].

==Philosophical and religious versions==

===Christian New Man===
The doctrines of [[Paul the Apostle]] speak of [[Adam]] both as the fallen "Old Adam" and a "New Adam" as referring collectively to the fallen Old Man of humanity and a resurrected "New Man" (Ephesians 2:15, The Holy Bible) following [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung Hoon Kim, Chŏng-hun Kim. ''The significance of clothing imagery in the Pauline Corpus''. New York, New York, USA: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004. Pp. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzschean ''Übermensch''===
Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of an ''[[Übermensch]]'' ("Overman") was that of a New Man who would be a leader by example to humanity through an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[will to power]] that was [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and [[Irrationalism|irrationalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Stralen. ''Choices and conflict: essays on literature and existentialism''. Pp. Brussels, Belgium: Peter Lang, 2005. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche developed the concept in response to his view of the [[herd mentality]] of and inherent [[nihilism]] of Christianity, and the void in existential meaning that is realized with the [[death of God]]. The Übermensch emerges as the new meaning of the Earth, a norm-repudiating individual who overcomes himself and is the master in control of his impulses and passions.

==Political versions==

===Liberal New Man===
[[Thomas Paine]] and [[William Godwin]] believed that the spread of liberalism in [[France]] and the [[United States]] constituted the birth of a New Man and a new era.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopian Socialist New Man===
[[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialists]] such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] saw a future [[Golden Age]] led by a New Man who would reconstruct society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist New Man===
{{see also|New Soviet man}}
[[Marxism]], though heavily critical of [[utopianism]], postulates the development of a New Man and New Woman in a [[communist society]] following the values of a non-essential nature of the state and the importance of [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely associated]] work for the affirmation of a person's humanity. Marxism does not see the New Man/Woman as a goal or prerequisite for achieving full communism, but rather as a product of the social conditions of pure communism. [[Che Guevara]]'s essay "Socialism and man in [[Cuba]]" and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' are two examples of the 'new man' archetype in socialist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm|title=Socialism and man in Cuba|first=Che|last=Guevara|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist New Man===
[[Fascism]] supports the creation of a New Man who is a figure of action, violence, and [[masculinity]], committed as a component of a disciplined mass that has shorn itself of [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. Pp. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this was the idea of the [[Political Soldier]], which was developed by the leaders of the [[Official National Front]] in the UK in the 1980s and became part of the ideology of the [[Third Position]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2010/04/26/political-soldiers-and-the-new-man-part-one |title=Political Soldiers and the New Man - part one |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 April 2010 |website=[[Community Security Trust]] |access-date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cst.org.uk/news/blog/2010/04/27/political-soldiers-and-the-new-man-part-two |title=Political Soldiers and the New Man - part two |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 April 2010 |website=[[Community Security Trust]] |access-date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhumanist New Man===
[[Transhumanism]] welcomes the creation of a literal ''new man'' by enhancements through cybernetics and other "human enhancements", and look to the [[Transhumanism#Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity|singularity]] as that point in time when the new man arrives, his birthday if you will.  Scholar [[Klaus Vondung]] argues that Transhumanism represents the final revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364|title=Revolutions: Finished and Unfinished, From Primal to Final|first1=Paul|last1=Caringella|first2=Wayne|last2=Cristaudo|first3=Glenn|last3=Hughes|date=21 February 2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have made similar observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5|title=New man in utopian and transhumanist perspective|first=Richard|last=Saage|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Futures Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3rABgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 Knowing New Biotechnologies: Social Aspects of Technological Convergence], p. 77-91&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nigeria]], '''open ballot system''', also known as '''Option A4''', is a [[voting method]] in which [[voter]]s vote openly by queuing or otherwise, indicating the candidate of their choice. This is as opposed to a [[secret ballot]], where a voter's choices are confidential. The system minimizes incidences of [[election rigging]] that comes with the secret ballot system as well as other electoral fraudulent-related practices.

The open ballot system was the norm prior to Australia adopting the secret ballot in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Newman, {{cite web|url= http://www.mumble.com.au/enrollingthepeople/tasmania/newman_tasmania_and_secret_ballot.pdf |title=Tasmania and the Secret Ballot }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(144&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} (2003), 49(1) ''Aust J Pol &amp; Hist 93'', accessed May 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the open ballot was first adopted in the [[Third Nigerian Republic]] during the [[Nigerian presidential election, 1993|1993 Nigerian presidential election]], an election that was widely regarded as the freest and fairest in the country's political history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerians remember MKO Abiola on June 12|url=http://tvcnews.tv/?q=article/nigerians-remember-mko-abiola-june-12-0|accessdate=18 April 2016|work=TVC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Making a point with Option A4|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/making-a-point-with-option-a4-2/|accessdate=18 April 2016|work=[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]]|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{this|Political Communications Principles|the academic journal|Political Communication (journal)}}

'''Political communication(s)''' is a subfield of [[communication]] and [[political science]] that is concerned with how [[information flow|information spread]]s and [[social influence|influences]] [[politics]] and [[policy maker]]s, the [[news media]] and [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/pnorris/Acrobat/Political%20Communications%20encyclopedia2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the amount of data to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and [[Social network analysis|network analysis]] have become key tools in the subfield. It deals with the production, dissemination, procession and effects of information, both through [[mass media]] and [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonally]], within a political context. This includes the study of the media, the analysis of [[political speech|speeches by politicians]] and those that are trying to influence the [[political process]], and formal and informal conversations among members of the public, among other aspects. The media acts as bridge between government and public. Political communication can be defined as the connection concerning politics and citizens and the interaction modes that connect these groups to each other. Whether the relationship is formed by the modes of persuasion, Pathos, Ethos or Logos. 

== Defining the concept ==

The study and practice of political communication focuses on the ways and means of expression of a political nature. Robert E. Denton and Gary C. Woodward, two important contributors to the field, in  ''Political Communication in America'' characterize it as the ways and intentions of message senders to influence the political environment. This includes public discussion (e.g. political speeches, news media coverage, and ordinary citizens' talk) that considers who has authority to sanction, the allocation of public resources, who has authority to make decision, as well as social meaning like what makes someone American. In their words "the crucial factor that makes communication 'political' is not the source of a message, but its content and purpose." &lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denton R.E., Woodward G.C.|title=Political Communication in America|publisher=New York: Praeger|year=1998|pages=11|isbn=978-0275957834}}&lt;/ref&gt; David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo, also key members of this sub-discipline, define political communication as "the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and action on political matters." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;Swanson, D. &amp; Nimmo D. "New Directions in Political Communication: A Resource Book." Thousand Oaks: Sage, 1990, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize the strategic nature of political communication, highlighting the role of [[persuasion]] in [[political discourse]]. Brian McNair provides a similar definition when he writes that political communication is "purposeful communication about politics." For McNair this means that this not only covers [[Words|verbal]] or [[written]] statements, but also [[visual]] representations such as dress, make-up, hairstyle or logo design. With other words, it also includes all those aspects that develop a "political identity" or "image".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McNair B. ''An Introduction to Political Communication'', London: Routledge, 2003, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting on the relationship between political communication and contemporary agenda-building, Vian Bakir defines Strategic Political Communication (SPC) as comprising 'political communication that is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] in intent, that utilises [[social science|social scientific]] techniques and heuristic devices to understand human [[motivation]], [[human behavior]] and the media environment, to inform effectively what should be communicated – encompassing its detail and overall direction – and what should be withheld, with the aim of taking into account and influencing [[public opinion]], and creating [[strategic alliance]]s and an enabling environment for government policies – both at home and abroad'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bakir, V.|title=Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles|publisher=Farnham: Ashgate|year=2013|pages=3|isbn=9781472402554}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are many academic departments and schools around the world that specialize in political communication. These programs are housed in programs of communication, [[political journalism|journalism]] and [[political science]], among others. The study of political communication is clearly [[interdisciplinary]].

== Contemporary examples of strategic political communication ==
The ''[[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]’s torture-for-intelligence policy'', initiated soon after [[9/11]], was kept secret for several years, as remains the level of complicity of many other nation-states' governments. While this secret policy was gradually revealed from 2004 onwards, initiated by the [[Abu Ghraib]] torture photos, the Bush administration engaged in SPC to publicly reframe and protect its secret policy. SPC included ''[[silencing]]'' and ''persuasive'' discursive activity.&lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse|Discursive]] activity aimed at generating ''silences'' comprised [[plea bargain]]s that silenced detainees, censoring Guantánamo detainees’ descriptions of their own torture in pre–trial hearings, deals with journalists to censor or withhold information that affected national security, weeding out personal sousveillance of torture online, suppression of visual [[sousveillance]] of torture while [[courts–martial]] and criminal investigations proceeded; destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations; and withholding key information from intelligence oversight committees. These position those in the know as part of an elite force policing the public sphere to keep the wider public and their representatives ignorant of unpalatable but necessary official practices, relegating the likely emotional and/or moral public dissent towards such practices as unaffordable niceties. 
* ''[[Persuasive]]'' [[discourse|discursive]] activity included the propagation and repetition of a few key messages consistently over time, with the aim of misdirecting [[public attention]] from the silence–generating activities. Key Bush Administration messages were that detainees were evil, dangerous [[war on terror|terrorists]]; that the practice of extraordinary rendition was normal and pragmatic; that interrogation techniques, although harsh, were legal (apart from isolated acts of abuse), necessary and successful in preventing future acts of terror; and that Guantánamo was a model prison. Key British Administration messages were of initial ministerial ignorance (until 2004) of American intelligence agencies’ new interrogation strategies, after which intelligence agencies’ guidelines were tightened; and of no direct involvement of British intelligence agencies in extraordinary rendition. Key messages common to both British and American Administrations were that the Abu Ghraib sousveillance and similar visual evidence involving British soldiers were examples of isolated abuse rather than a torture policy from which lessons had been learned regarding Army training and interrogation guidance (new Army guidelines on interrogation were produced under the Bush and Blair Administrations). These key messages were propagated through a range of discursive activity (including [[press conference]]s and media interviews, authorised [[News leak|leak]]s, real–time reporting, official investigations and [[public inquiries]]) and were periodically bolstered by selective public release of once–secret documents. The consistency of key messages over time, together with the offering up of specific evidence, gives the appearance of official disclosure and truth–telling, positioning the public as a force to which political administrations willingly hold themselves accountable. However, the strategic generation of key messages and selectivity of supporting information presented across all these discursive modes means that full [[accountability]] is avoided, while the public is potentially fooled into thinking that [[justice]] has been served, all–the–while being constant targets of manipulation.

==Fields and areas of study==

The field of political communication is focused on 4 main areas:

* [[Election campaigns]] - Political communications involved in campaigning for elections.
* [[Government operations]] - This role is usually fulfilled by a [[Ministry of Communications]], [[Information Technology]] or similar political entity. Such an entity is in charge of maintaining communication legislation and would be responsible for setting [[telecommunications]] policy and regulations as well as issuing broadcasting licenses, comments [[press releases]], etc...
*[[Content (media)|Media content]] - The interaction between politics, media content and the public.
*[[Communication|Communication processes]] - How people communication about about politics.

According to [[James Chesebro]], there are five critical approaches to contemporary Political communications:
# [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] - i.e. power relationships
# [[Symbol|Iconic]] - symbols are important
# [[Ritual]]istic - Redundant and superficial nature of political acts - manipulation of symbols.
# [[Leadership|Confirmation]] - political aspects looked at as people we endorse
# [[Narrative|Dramatistic]] - politics is symbolically constructed. (Kenneth Burke)

==Role of social media==
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run. With more [[digital native]] citizens coming into the [[voting]] population, social media is the platform on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the voters. In a [[digital age]], social media will be more important than traditional media to the politicians.

Taking Australia as an example below: 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media. (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With almost half of Australian voting population active on social media, political parties are adapting quickly to influence and connect with their voters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesocialsavior.com/benefits-of-social-media-for-business/&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media experience relies heavily on the user themselves due to the platforms' algorithms which tailor consumer experience for each user. This results in each person seeing more like-minded news due to the increase in digital social behavior. Additionally, social media has changed politics because it has given politicians a direct medium to give their constituents information and the people to speak directly to the politicians. This informal nature can lead to informational mistakes because it is not being subjected to the same "[[Fact checking|fact-checking]] processes as institutional journalism." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d2NCDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=political+communication+in+media+society&amp;ots=ofCknFEU1v&amp;sig=UHjO4A3LY9_GEVss0uKJvsJgeJM#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20communication%20in%20media%20society&amp;f=false|title=Mass Media and American Politics|last=Graber|first=Doris A.|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|date=2017-07-20|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781506340227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media creates greater opportunity for political persuasion due to the high number of citizens that regularly engage and build followings on social media. The more that a person engages on social media, the more influential they believe themselves to be, resulting in more people considering themselves to be politically persuasive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=Brian E.|last2=Ardèvol-Abreu|first2=Alberto|last3=Gil de Zúñiga|first3=Homero|date=2015-12-31|title=Online Influence?

'''Political culture''' is defined by the ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' as the "set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments that give order and meaning to a [[Politics|political]] process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the [[political system]]". It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a [[polity]]. Political culture is thus the manifestation of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political ''culture'' is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', New York: Macmillen, 1968, Vol. 12, p. 218 (quoted in Jo Freedman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polparties/polculture.htm The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/january8/obitalmond-18.html Stanford Report, Obit: Gabriel Almond, January 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verba|first1=Sidney|last2=Almond|first2=Gabriel|title=The Civic Culture|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.

The second key feature is "consensus" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various "Examples of Consensus" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.

The third feature of British political culture is "homogeneity". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.

==Political philosophy==
The term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by [[Gabriel Almond]] in the late 50s, and outlined in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963, [[Gabriel Almond|Almond]] &amp; [[Sidney Verba|Verba]]), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, [[Gerhard Lehmbruch]] and [[Arend Lijphart]]. Lehmbruch analysed politics in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] and Lijphart analysed politics in [[Netherlands]]. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Lukšič, Igor (2006). ''Politična kultura'', pp. 40–42. [[University of Ljubljana|FDV, Ljubljana]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: [[anarchism]], [[oligarchy]], [[Tory corporatism]], [[fascism]], [[classical liberalism]], radical liberalism, [[democratic socialism]], and [[Leninist socialism]]. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.

[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' outlined three pure types of political culture based on  level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
* [[Parochial political culture|Parochial]] – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the [[civic culture]], which mixes the best elements of each.

[[Arend Lijphart]] wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:
* First classification:
** Mass political culture
** [[Elite]] political culture
* Second classification (of elite political culture):
** coalitional
** contradictive

Lijphart also classified the structure of society:
* homogeneous
* heterogeneous

 --&gt;{{DISPLAYTITLE:Politics of ''Harry Potter''}}
There are many published theories about the '''politics of the''' '''''Harry Potter''''' books by [[J. K. Rowling]], which range from them containing criticism of racism to anti-government sentiments. According to ''Inside Higher Ed'', doctoral theses have been devoted to the Harry Potter books.&lt;ref&gt;McLemee, Scott [http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/07/18/mclemee ''Pottering Around''] Inside Higher Ed, 18 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several university courses centred on analysis of the Potter series, including an upper division [[political science]] course.&lt;ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine noted the political and social aspects of Harry Potter in their 2007 [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] issue where Rowling placed third behind politicians [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Nancy |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |title=Time Magazine |work=Time |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912150656/www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Potter's potential social and political impact was called similar to the 19th-century phenomenon of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s popular, but critically maligned book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which fuelled the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement leading up to the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.metrosantacruz.com/metro-santa-cruz/05.23.07/harry-potter-0721.html Readers Of the World, Unite: Metro Santa Cruz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224001339/http://www.metrosantacruz.com/metro-santa-cruz/05.23.07/harry-potter-0721.html |date=24 December 2008 }}

When asked about the politics and message in ''Harry Potter'', Rowling explained, "I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a [[hierarchy]], you have [[bigotry]], and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops up all over the world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity. [...]. It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the [[Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] even before it's taken over, there are parallels to [[regime]]s we all know and love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more |title=J. K. Rowling at Carnegie Hall Reveals Dumbledore is Gay; Neville Marries Hannah Abbott, and Much More |publisher=The-leaky-cauldron.org |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "You should question authority and you should not assume that [[the establishment]] or [[News media|the press]] tells you all of the truth."&lt;ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' compared [[Neville Chamberlain]] to Rowling's [[Cornelius Fudge]], saying both were eager to help their constituents look the other way to avoid war. "Throughout the '30s, Chamberlain, fearing that Churchill was out for his job, conducted a campaign against his fellow Tory. Chamberlain tried evading war with Germany, and ridiculed Churchill as a 'warmonger'. He used ''[[The Times]]''—the government's house organ—to attack Churchill and suppress dispatches from abroad about the Nazis that would have vindicated him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Last | last=Jonathan | title=History according to Harry | date=15 July 2005 | url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112139373085986556 | work =Wall Street Journal | pages =W.13 | accessdate =24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling confirmed Chamberlain was her inspiration in the Spanish newspaper magazine ''XLSemanal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=J.

Rowling also told the Dutch newspaper ''de Volkskrant'' that [[Voldemort]] was modeled on Hitler and Stalin, as a megalomaniac and paranoid figure, and that she was influenced by the Second World War, which is "anchored in all our minds": discussing Draco Malfoy, she claimed "Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy. He wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore, he couldn’t. As long as things are imaginary, okay, but once it becomes reality, the thing becomes more difficult.", on the other hand, "No, that I gave him that light blonde hair is not because I wanted to make him into a scary Nazi. You give your characters the appearance that you find attractive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New Interview with J. K.

==Education versus indoctrination==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted that the post-[[11 September 2001 attacks|9/11]] generation's "ideas about war, about leadership, about the dangers of consolidation of power and of dictatorship, about the importance of dissent, and about heroism and sacrifice, have been shaped at least in part by Rowling," and that their concept of [[freedom of speech]] has been influenced by Rowling's weathering of her books' routine challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20152943_20153269_20161218_27,00.html The Top 25 Entertainers of the year] Entertainment Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] joined in the political fray over Harry Potter character [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s outing by asking if it was part of a "gay agenda" to indoctrinate children. He called J. K. Rowling a [[wiktionary:provocateur|provocateur]] for telling fans about Dumbledore's sexuality after the books were written. His guest, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' Senior Editor Tina Jordan, called his "indoctrination" claims "a shallow argument", saying "indoctrination is a very strong word" because "we all know gay people, whether we know it or not."&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel.  23 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly continued the following day saying that the real problem is Rowling is teaching "tolerance" and "parity for homosexuals with heterosexuals". His guest [[Dennis Miller]] said that tolerance was good and didn't think you could indoctrinate a child into being gay.&lt;ref&gt;''The O'Reilly Factor'', Fox News Channel.  24 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zenit News Agency|Zenit]], a news agency dedicated to promoting the message of the Catholic Church, accused Rowling of betraying her readers by disclosing Dumbledore's sexuality, and said Rowling is the wealthiest woman in Britain thanks to the lack of political, social or moral propaganda in her books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-20892?l=english |title=Benedict XVI's Pep Talk; A Potter Betrayal |publisher=Zenit.org |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331105044/http://www.zenit.org/article-20892?l=english |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of [[Human Life International]], an American-based Roman Catholic activist pro-life organisation, taking a negative view of the books and "their literary offspring", said that Harry Potter indoctrinates young souls in the language and mechanics of the [[occult]] and said that Rowling's portrayal of Dumbledore socialises if not indoctrinates young people into tolerance of gays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007/nov/07110611.html |title=HLI Head Says Harry Potter Indoctrinates Young Souls in Language and Mechanics of Occult |publisher=Lifesite.net |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Berkeley Beacon]]'' said that one parent's perception of [[indoctrination]] is another's education, in their article, ''No Politics in Harry Potter'', which countered charges that Rowling promoted homosexuality in her books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.berkeleybeacon.com/media/storage/paper169/news/2007/11/01/Opinion/No.Politics.In.Harry.Potter-3072191.shtml|title=No politics in Harry Potter – Opinion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105084221/http://media.www.berkeleybeacon.com/media/storage/paper169/news/2007/11/01/Opinion/No.Politics.In.Harry.Potter-3072191.shtml|archivedate=5 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the controversy, Rowling told the BBC that "Christian fundamentalists were never my base" and thought it ridiculous to question if a gay person could be a [[moral compass]] in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10473639"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10473639 |title=Rowling says goodbye to Potter with fairy tales |date=2 November 2007 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the values and morality of her characters Draco and Dudley, Rowling explained that both were indoctrinated with their parents' beliefs. "The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,'' reality finally hit him," Rowling said, because his dream was "so very different". She said that there was a real moral cowardice to Draco, but that he was not wholly bad.&lt;ref name="mtv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1572399/20071019/story.jhtml |title=MTV |publisher=MTV |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism, mistreatment of minorities and totalitarianism==
[[File:Nuremberg laws Racial Chart.jpg|thumb|The "pure-blood", "half-blood" and "Mudblood"/"Muggle-born" divisions used in Harry Potter are redolent of the system distinguishing Jews, Germans, "mixed blood: first degree" and "mixed blood: second degree" in [[Nazi Germany]], as in this chart.]]
Analysts note the criticism of racism in J. K. Rowling's texts.&lt;ref&gt;

When asked about the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, "I do not think I am pessimistic but I think I am realistic about how much you can change deeply entrenched prejudice, so my feeling would be that if someone were a committed racist, possibly ''Harry Potter'' is not going to have an effect."&lt;ref name="raincoast"&gt;[http://www.raincoast.com/press-releases/2005/0718-hbp-press-conference.html Transcript of the Harry Potter Children's Press Conference Weekend] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018214907/http://www.raincoast.com/press-releases/2005/0718-hbp-press-conference.html |date=18 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in a post-''Deathly Hallows'' webchat about [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s future, Rowling said, "Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk. She then moved to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she was a progressive voice who ensured the eradication of oppressive, pro-pureblood laws."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/ Webchat with J. K. Rowling, 30 July 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525033940/http://www.bloomsbury.com/jkrevent/ |date=25 May 2007 }} www.bloomsbury.com&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'', Rowling responded to queries about metaphors in the books for [[ethnic cleansing]]: "Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;I want to recreate [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, in the—in the wizarding world. Because—although there are—quite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out."&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/20001720/page/4/ Harry Potter: The final chapter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014014450/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/20001720/page/4/ |date=14 October 2007 }}. MSNBC. Retrieved 9 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling also compared her character [[Voldemort]] to paranoid [[megalomania]]cs like [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sue |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/11/19/new-interview-with-j-k-rowling-for-release-of-dutch-edition-of-deathly-hallows |title=New Interview with J. K. Rowling for Release of Dutch Edition of "Deathly Hallows" |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2007 book tour Rowling further discussed the topic, stating "It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." She prefaced the remark, saying "People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more |title=The Leaky Cauldron |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling stated on her website that the ''Harry Potter'' phrases 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' compared to "some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58 J. K. Rowling Official Website|Faqs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027034559/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58 |date=27 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] noted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the [[lightning discharge|lightning bolt]]—the shape of the scar which [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] received as a result of [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s curse, now considered to be [[emblem]]atic of the series—is also the symbol of Sir [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]], a prominent group of Nazi sympathisers during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = "Hitchens"&gt;Hitchens, Christopher. The Boy Who Lived, published 12 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis themselves, in their SS, [[Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel|made use of the symbol too]]. In the same article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/books/review/Hitchens-t.html|title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J. K. Rowling - Books - Review|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=12 August 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens noted that "The prejudice against bank-monopoly goblins is modeled more or less on anti-Semitism and the foul treatment of elves is meant to put us in mind of slavery".

J. K. Rowling mentions in an article that Mosley was married to [[Diana Mitford]], sister of her heroine, [[Jessica Mitford]]. Jessica, after whom Rowling named her daughter, never forgave Diana's Nazi sympathies.&lt;ref name="itgirl"&gt;J. K. Rowling: "The First It Girl." Sunday Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; Oswald and Diana married in 1936, in the Berlin home of Nazi chief [[Joseph Goebbels]] with Adolf Hitler as a guest. J. K. Rowling also noted that Mitford's other sister [[Unity Mitford|Unity]], to whom Jessica was closest in youth, became an arch-fascist and favourite of Adolf Hitler's.&lt;ref name="itgirl" /&gt;

Jessica's story may have thus inspired a part of Harry's story: [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]] (analogue to Diana Mosley) married a Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy (Oswald Mosley). Her sister, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] (Unity Mitford), was herself a Death Eater, and a favourite of Lord Voldemort (Adolf Hitler). [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] (Jessica Mitford) married the Muggle-born [[Ted Tonks]] against her family's wishes (as Jessica eloped with her cousin [[Esmond Romilly]]) and was blasted out of the [[Black Family|family-tree tapestry]]. These parallels were noted in the American communist newspaper ''[[People's Weekly World]]''.&lt;ref name = "Albano" /&gt;

In an act commemorating [[the Holocaust]], actor [[Daniel Radcliffe]], whose mother is Jewish, donated his first pair of [[Harry Potter]] glasses to an art exhibition inspired by a famous World War II photo of a mangled mountain of spectacles of victims of ethnic cleansing. Radcliffe's ''Potter'' co-star [[Jason Isaacs]], who played [[Lucius Malfoy]] in the films, himself a Jewish Briton, was due to participate in the commemorations on National [[Holocaust Memorial Day]], leading a service at [[Liverpool]]'s Philharmonic Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/jewish-world-voldemort-s-sidekick-turns-jewish-psychiatrist-in-film-on-nazi-era-1.268520|title=Jewish World / Voldemort's Sidekick Turns Jewish Psychiatrist in Film on Nazi Era|first=The|last=Forward|date=31 January 2018|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aviva Chomsky]] (daughter of famed academic [[Noam Chomsky]]) in the ''[[Providence Journal]]'' suggests that ''Harry Potter'' is a parable on immigration rights, noting that US "immigration, citizenship and naturalization laws are based explicitly on discrimination on the basis of national origin. Where you were born, and what passport you carry, determine whether you have the right to come here, to visit, to work, or to live here."&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Aviva: [http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_chomsky12_09-12-07_9L6TPDP.1544d8d.html Harry Potter and immigration]. ''Providence Journal'', 13 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evils of war==
On the ''Harry Potter'' series, Rowling said on her United States book tour in October 2007, "I very consciously wanted to show what is one of the great evils of war, which is that totally innocent people are slaughtered... Another great evil of war is that children lose their families."&lt;ref&gt;

==Progressive values and diversity==
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said in 2005, "Rowling adapts an inherently conservative genre for her own [[progressivism|progressive]] purposes. Her [[Hogwarts]] is [[secularism|secular]] and [[wiktionary:Sexual|sexual]] and multicultural and [[multiracial]] and even sort of [[multimedia]], with all those talking ghosts."&lt;ref name = "Großman"&gt;Grossman, Lev J. K. Rowling, Hogwarts and all Time, 17 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the French publication of ''Deathly Hallows'', prominent French center-left paper ''[[Libération|Liberation]]'' devoted the front cover and two more pages to answering the question "Why Harry Potter is of the Left".&lt;ref name="Harry Potter seen as left-wing hero"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-arts-harrypotter/harry-potter-seen-as-left-wing-hero-idUSL261941720071026|title=Harry Potter seen as left-wing hero|date=26 October 2007|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, responding to a question from a child about [[Dumbledore]]'s love life, Rowling revealed, "I always saw Dumbledore as gay." Filling in a few more details, she said, "Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald.... Don't forget, falling in love can blind us. [He] was very drawn to this brilliant person. This was Dumbledore's tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2007/10/rowling-outs-du.html |title=Entertainment Weekly |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=20 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melissa Anelli, webmaster of the fan site [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]], told The Associated Press, "Jo Rowling calling any Harry Potter character gay would make wonderful strides in tolerance toward homosexuality.... By dubbing someone so respected, so talented and so kind, as someone who just happens to be also homosexual, she's reinforcing the idea that a person's gayness is not something of which they should be ashamed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21407911/ |title=MSNBC |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ensuing controversy, Rowling said, "I know that it was a positive thing that I said it, for at least one person, because one man 'came out' at Carnegie Hall."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/269527 Rowling knew early on Dumbledore was gay] The Star&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] said "her choice to make a beloved professor-mentor gay in a world where gay teachers are still routinely slandered as malign influences was, I am certain, no accident." Harris also says that there is a drastic underrepresentation of gays in the population, and it is a failure of decency and nerve on the entertainment industry— "including the tremendous number of gay producers, writers, and executives who sacrifice their convictions so they don't look too ''strident'' or ''political.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris |first=Mark |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20154416,00.html |title=Dumbledore: A Lovely Outing |publisher=Ew.com |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Think Progress]], a [[Progressivism|progressive]] news site, conservative blogs say{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;!---What is it now? Are conservative blogs saying this or is it TP saying that they say? If the former is correct, then report it, if not, it is a false claim and should be discarded.

Baggett, who coauthored the book ''Harry Potter and Philosophy: If Aristotle Ran Hogwarts'', says he was taken aback not only by Rowling's announcement, but by the fact that it came on the heels of her confirming many Potter fans' belief that the series had Christian themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-to.dumbledore23oct23,0,5228256.story |title=Albus Dumbledore cast in a new light |publisher=Baltimoresun.com |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830065623/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-to.dumbledore23oct23,0,5228256.story |archivedate=30 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slate Magazine'' quotes an attendee of the book talk who said, "It was clear that JKR didn't plan to out Dumbledore. She just cares about being true to her readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickman |first=Forrest |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2176455/ |title=Bloggers on Stephen Colbert's presidential run. – By Laurel Wamsley – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Thomas of the ''Orlando Sentinel'' said that upon reflection, Dumbledore was gay from the beginning, and that this neatly explains the behaviour of his character and his relationship with Grindelwald. Thomas notes the skill Rowling displays in writing a gay character without having to put a gay label on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_columnist_mikethomas/2007/10/so-dumbledore-i.html |title=So Dumbledore is Gay |publisher=Blogs.orlandosentinel.com |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522041646/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_columnist_mikethomas/2007/10/so-dumbledore-i.html |archivedate=22 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reuters, Rowling was surprised over the fuss and declined to say whether her "outing" of Dumbledore might alienate those who disapprove of homosexuality. "It has certainly never been news to me that a brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is and I have the right to say what I say about him," she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]] and [[MuggleNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ian&amp;nbsp;Bremmer |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2007-10-23T152444Z_01_N23210446_RTRUKOC_0_US-ARTS-ROWLING.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |title=Dumbledore brave, brilliant; why not gay: Rowling |publisher=Today.reuters.com |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025041215/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2007-10-23T152444Z_01_N23210446_RTRUKOC_0_US-ARTS-ROWLING.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |archivedate=25 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[David Thewlis]] ([[Remus Lupin]]) said that he was surprised about Dumbledore's sexuality, because while he was filming ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] had the idea that "Lupin was gay, and he described my character like a 'gay junkie'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sue |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/25/video-interview-with-david-thewlis-on-dumbledore-revelation-and-more |title=The Leaky Cauldron |publisher=The Leaky Cauldron |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic fantasy author Regina Doman wrote an essay titled "In Defense of Dumbledore", in which she argued that the books actually support Catholic teaching on homosexuality because Dumbledore's relationship with the dark wizard Grindelwald leads to obviously terrible results, as he becomes interested in dark magic himself, neglects his responsibilities towards his younger sister and ultimately causes her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Defense of Dumbledore|author=Regina Doman|work=therambleronline.com|year=2007|url=http://therambleronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=181&amp;Itemid=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224111126/http://therambleronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=181&amp;Itemid=1|archivedate=24 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Florida ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]''{{'}}s book reviewer Chauncey Mabe says that it was wrong for Rowling to disclose Dumbledore's [[sexual orientation]]. Mabe was clear that this was not due to Dumbledore's being gay, but to his own objections to authors continuing to talk about their books after they are written. He called for Rowling to "please be quiet, please" in "public gatherings", which is contrary to the massive popularity of Rowling's book talks and her fans' thirst for more information about characters in the Harry Potter books. Mabe notes that 1,000 children attended the "reading" before they were given autographed books. Robin Berkowitz, ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' Entertainment Editor says of Rowling's comments, and other revelations she might make about her characters "We don't need to know any of them to appreciate the books fully," "Don't ask, don't spell" a reference to the U.S. military's former policy on homosexuality, [[Don't ask, don't tell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/features/arts/offthepage/blog/2007/10/dont_ask_dont_spell_1.html |title=Don't ask, don't spell |publisher=Weblogs.sun-sentinel.com |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are mirrored by Jeffrey Weiss in his article, "Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up", published in the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-rowlingcolumn_1024gl.State.Edition1.2292bdc.html Harry Potter and the author who wouldn't shut up] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025084037/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-rowlingcolumn_1024gl.State.Edition1.2292bdc.html |date=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Michael Gerson says "tolerance is one of the main themes of the Harry Potter books. In a marvelous social comparison, [[lycanthropy]] is treated as a kind of chronic disease, with [[werewolves]] subject to discrimination as if they had AIDS."&lt;ref name="Harry Potter's Secret"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/25/AR2007102502233.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 |title=Harry Potter's Secret |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 April 2012 |first=Michael |last=Gerson |date=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social activism==
According to [[Philip Nel]] of [[Kansas State University]], the Potter series can be seen as "political novels that critique racism and racial superiority. Rowling, who worked for [[Amnesty International]], evokes her social activism through Hermione's passion for oppressed elves and the formation of her "Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/potter/2001-11-16-analysis.htm |title='Potter' inspires academic analysis |work=USA Today |date=16 November 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dobby the house elf]] has been compared to the labour lawyer [[Dobby Walker]] who introduced Rowling's heroine, Jessica Mitford, to the [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;*Morag Traynor, Is Dobby a Communist?

Hermione is depicted as starting a campaign to emancipate the enslaved [[House elves]], using the methods of real-world campaigns on social and political issues such as badges with slogans. She persists in this campaigning also when it is considered quixotic even by her close friends and not much appreciated even by most of the House elves themselves. But in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', the campaign turns out to have had enormous unforeseen results, with House elves joining the struggle and making several indispensable contributions to Voldemort's final defeat and saving the main protagonists' lives. Rowling said in an early interview that Hermione and her political conscience about the rights of elves was fairly autobiographical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Evan | last=Solomon | title=J. K. Rowling Interview | date=13 July 2000 | url =http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-hottype-solomon.htm | work =CBCNewsWorld: Hot Type | accessdate =9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subversive and anarchistic message==
Gerson of the ''Washington Post'' also described what he considered to be the very [[subversive]] nature of the Harry Potter books in the answer they offer to death. Voldemort believes that death must be mastered and "beaten". In contrast, Harry accepts the necessity of his own death for the sake of love. Gerson also suggests that some will ask the book series about tolerance also be a book series about religion. He answers that many others "believe – not in spite of their faith but because of it – that half-bloods, werewolves and others should be treated with kindness and fairness. Above all, believers are called to love, even at the highest cost."&lt;ref name="Harry Potter's Secret"/&gt;

In a 1999 interview with Rowling, ''[[The Guardian]] Unlimited''{{'}}s Joanna Carey said, "JK Rowling is every bit as witty and subversive as you'd expect. Rowling described her admiration of Jessica Mitford since age 14, her time at [[Exeter University]] "not quite the chance to be the 'radical' I planned", and said the later books dealing with Harry's hormones, and deaths would be unlike other children's series like the [[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]. Carey suggested a parallel between Harry Potter and [[Prince Harry]] which Rowling laughs off saying a friend said never let the press make you discuss the [[royal family]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3822242,00.html|title=Who doesn't know Harry?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Morone, a political science professor at [[Brown University]], wrote in the liberal ''[[American Prospect]]'' in 2001, "Magical headmaster Albus Dumbledore practically awards bonus points for breaking rules. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is unruly, even slightly anarchic. Harry's classmate Hermione 'had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules,' writes Rowling near the end of ''Philosopher's Stone'', 'and she was much nicer for it.' There's more than a touch of anarchy when all the students sing to their own tune. In her books, the kids are the central agents of their own lives. They make choices. Weigh judgments. Wrestle with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=cultural_phenomena_dumbledores_message |title=Cultural Phenomena: Dumbledore's Message |publisher=Prospect.org |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabelle Smadja of ''[[Le Monde]]'' wrote that Harry Potter is the first fictional hero of the anti-[[globalism|globalist]], anti-capitalist, pro-[[Third World]], "[[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|Seattle]]" generation. She wrote that "Examination of the text suggests that they are, in fact, a ferocious critique of [[consumerism|consumer society]] and the world of [[free enterprise]]."&lt;ref name = "Lichfield"&gt;[http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=132&amp;fArticleId=2138008 French go potty over Harry's politics], Lichfield, John.

==Conservative objections to liberal and socialist values==
The right-wing U.S. [[John Birch Society]] has objected to Rowling's books and her public statements. In his article for the John Birch Society's magazine ''The New American'', [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] Communications Director Steve Bonta compared ''Harry Potter'' negatively to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', saying, "The Potter books read in places like diatribes against the modern middle class, especially whenever Harry confronts his ludicrously dysfunctional and downright abusive adopted family, [[Dursley family|the Dursleys]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[Tolkien]]'s Timeless Tale |author= Steve Bonta |journal=The New American |date=28 January 2002 |volume=18 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of conservative and sexist themes==
The critic [[Anthony Holden]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' on his experience of judging ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' for the [[1999 Whitbread Awards]]. His overall view of the series was very negative—"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, very conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly [[nostalgic]] for a bygone Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,6903,335923,00.html|work=The Observer |title=Why Harry Potter doesn't cast a spell over me|date=25 June 2000 | location=London | first=Anthony | last=Holden | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' echoed this interpretation and stated that "despite all of the books' gestures to multiculturalism and gender equality, Harry Potter is a conservative; a paternalistic, One-Nation [[Tory]], perhaps, but a Tory nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Adams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/18/harrypotter.jkjoannekathleenrowling |title=Quidditch quaintness |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 April 2012 |location=London |date=18 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon.com]] critic Christine Schoefer has also criticised the books as [[sexist]], claiming that the series presents a [[patriarchal]] world filled with stereotypes and adherence to "the conventional assumption that men do and should run the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Salon.com| url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/01/13/potter/index.html| title=Harry Potter's girl trouble| first=Christine| last=Schoefer| accessdate=20 June 2006| date=12 January 2000| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705003943/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/01/13/potter/index.html| archivedate=5 July 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an interviewer suggested her books portrayed a conservative world, Rowling replied, "So I'm told repeatedly. The two groups of people who are constantly thanking me are [[Wicca]]ns and [[boarding school]]s. And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them. [[New Age|New ageism]] leaves me completely cold, and [my daughter] would never go to boarding school. I went to a [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]]."&lt;ref name = "Hattenstone"&gt;Hattenstone, Simon. [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-guardian-hattenstone.htm "Harry, Jessica and me"], The Guardian, 8 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling says she gets frustrated with the "conservative world thing". She made Hogwarts a boarding school so that action could happen in the middle of the night and to create a sense of community among the characters. Harry also reflects the modern world, she argues, in that he is [[mixed race]] — [[James Potter|his father]] being [[pure-blood (Harry Potter)|pure-blood]], [[Lily Potter|his mother]] being [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]]."&lt;ref name = "Hattenstone" /&gt; She also says her feminist conscience is saved by [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], "who's the brightest character" and is a "very strong female character".&lt;ref name="O"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0101-oprah.html J. K. Rowling's Books That Made a Difference] ''O, The Oprah Magazine'' January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoliberal and capitalist values==
In an article published in prominent French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', literary scholar Ilias Yocaris argued that ''Harry Potter'' "probably unintentionally ... appears as a summary of the social and educational aims of [[neoliberal]] capitalism." According to Yocaris' analysis, all life at [[Hogwarts]] is dominated by a culture of competition: "competition among students to be prefect; competition among [[Hogwarts houses]] to gain points; competition among sorcery schools to win the Triwizard tournament; and, ultimately, the bloody competition between the forces of Good and Evil." The [[free market]] plays a prominent and positive role, while the state (the [[Ministry of Magic]]) is presented as inefficient and bureaucratic. In this "pitiless jungle", education only aims to "give students an immediately exploitable practical knowledge that can help them in their battle to survive," while artistic subjects and social sciences are useless or absent. Yocaris concludes that "like [[Orwellian]] [[totalitarianism]], this capitalism tries to fashion not only the real world, but also the imagination of consumer-citizens," producing literature that suggests that no alternative is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA153AF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713175400/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA153AF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 July 2012 |title=Harry Potter, Market Wiz. |author=Yokaris, Ilias |work=New York Times |date=18 July 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'', Michael Ostling also argued that the series depicts a modern capitalist and [[consumer society|consumerist]] society, where the role of [[gadget]]ry is played by magic.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Potter and the Disenchantment of the
World. By Michael Ostling. Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 18, No. 1, 2003. pp. 3–23 [http://www.ic.arizona.edu/ic/soc3173/readings/OstlingPotter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The article by Yocaris provoked the response by Isabelle Smadja cited previously.

==Class distinctions==
''[[O: The Oprah Magazine]]'' noted that Rowling admires [[Roddy Doyle]] and [[Jane Austen]], saying "both of whom write about class distinctions," and asked if the reason Rowling wrote about class was a conscious decision. Rowling replied, "kids are acutely aware of money—before they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how another kid holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I think back to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And not being able to buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches. Having enough money to fit in is an important facet of life—and what is more conformist than a school?"&lt;ref name="O" /&gt;

==Anti-government interpretation==
Some political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratised]] Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the "registration of [[Blood purity (Harry Potter)|Mudbloods]]" with the Ministry) as an allegory [[anti-statism|criticising the state]].&lt;ref&gt;

The ''[[People's Weekly World]]'', the newspaper of the [[Communist Party USA]], claims the books draw you "into the politics of the wizarding world—the 'Educational Decrees' from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of 'war criminals' from the last rise of Voldemort, the {{sic|predjudice}} against 'mudbloods' and 'half-breeds.'" They suggest connections "to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the [[Cornelius Fudge|Fudge administration]] and the [[Presidency of George W.

Philosopher Jean-Claude Milner claimed "Harry Potter is a war machine against the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]ite-[[Tony Blair|Blair]]ist world and the 'American Way of Life'" in France's ''[[Libération]]''.&lt;ref name="Harry Potter seen as left-wing hero"/&gt;

[[University of Tennessee]] law professor Benjamin Barton discusses [[libertarianism|libertarian]] aspects of ''Harry Potter'' in his paper ''Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy'', published in the ''[[Michigan Law Review]]''. Barton says, "Rowling's scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often to the detriment of the public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a [[public interest|public-interest]] scholar's dream—or nightmare—government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michiganlawreview.org/archive/104/6/Barton.pdf ''Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810010003/http://www.michiganlawreview.org/archive/104/6/Barton.pdf |date=10 August 2007 }} Michigan Law Review&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling describes the beloved wizard Dumbledore as [[Machiavellian]] and says "I wanted you to question Dumbledore. It is right to question him, because he was treating people like puppets, and he was asking Harry to do a job that most men twice his age wouldn't have been able to do."&lt;ref name="mtv.com"/&gt;

==Characters compared to George Bush, Tony Blair, and Saddam Hussein==
''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine asked [[Alfonso Cuarón]], director of the third film based on Rowling's ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' if the villainous wizard Voldemort still reminded him of [[George W. Bush]]. Cuarón confirmed, "In combination with [[Saddam]]. They both have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people. I read books four and five, and Fudge is similar to Tony Blair. He's the ultimate politician. He's in denial about many things. And everything is for the sake of his own persona, his own power. The way the Iraq thing was handled was not unlike the way Fudge handled affairs in book four."&lt;ref&gt;

*Carla Power and Devin Gordon, ''Caution: Wizard at Work.'' Newsweek magazine, 4 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate Magazine]]'' also says Rowling takes jabs at the Bush and Blair administrations suggesting the Ministry of Magic's security pamphlet recalls the much-scorned [[Operation TIPS]] (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). The author also suggests that [[Azkaban]], the wizard penitentiary, is a stand-in for [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name="osama"&gt;Turner, Julia When Harry Met Osama; Terrorism comes to Hogwarts. 20 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling has never confirmed these interpretations in ''Harry Potter''; however, when the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] once asked her to endorse the Labour Party while Tony Blair was Prime Minister, Rowling refused.&lt;ref name="accio-quote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0201-edwards-telegraph.html |title=2001 |publisher=Accio Quote! |date=18 February 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling attacked the Blair government's policy on single parent families. She said that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] could do "a good deal more" and then donated £500,000 to the One Parent Families charity to set an example.&lt;ref name="accio-quote" /&gt; Rowling said that Brown's measures for children 'would have made a real difference to my family's life' when she was poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1879661,00.html |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Who will have the last word? | date=24 September 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair stepped down shortly before the release of Rowling's seventh book, and Brown was appointed Prime Minister. Rowling subsequently donated £1 million to the Labour Party during the 2010 general election which Labour lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jk-rowling-donates-pound1m-to-labour-936434.html|title=JK Rowling donates £1m to Labour|last=Woodcock|first=Andrew|date=20 September 2008|work=The Independent |accessdate=15 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education reform in ''The Order of the Phoenix''==
Teachers have hailed ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' as a "blistering satire on years of politically motivated interference in the running of schools".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Stephen Rowling causes umbrage with her Umbridge... Scotsman&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling describes her character [[Dolores Umbridge]], the Ministry-appointed headmistress of Hogwarts and under-secretary to the minister, Cornelius Fudge, saying "She has good contacts at the Ministry. She is one of those people, and they do exist in real life, who will always side with the established order. As far as she is concerned authority cannot be wrong so she doesn't question it, and I would go as far as to say that whatever happened and whoever took over at the Ministry, Umbridge would be there, she likes power. So she is going to side with the people who give her the authority."&lt;ref name="raincoast" /&gt;

Andrew Slack, founder of the [[Harry Potter Alliance]], says in ''[[In These Times]]'', "Harry Potter supersedes news about genocide, men assess their 'worth' by their paychecks, women's bodies are treated as commodities and our educational system preoccupies itself not with stimulating children's curiosity but rather getting them to efficiently regurgitate information on standardised tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Slack | title=Harry Potter and the Muggle Activists | date=26 October 2007 | url =http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3365/harry_potter_and_the_muggle_activists/ | work =In These Times | accessdate =20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungarian Secretary of State for Education [[Rózsa Hoffmann]] and her reforms have often been compared to Dolores Umbridge and her actions in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirszerzo.hu/velemeny/2011/3/10/20110310_vegre_fontos_dolgok|title=Végre a fontos dolgokkal foglalkoznak (nem)|author=Ceglédi Zoltán|date=10 March 2011|accessdate=22 August 2012|publisher=Hírszerző|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fóti Péter|url=http://www.foti-peter.hu/umbridge.html|date=June 2010|title=Professzor Umbridge céljai és eszközei|accessdate=22 August 2012|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogol.hu/comment.php?log=3830324|author=Scott J.

==Anti-terrorism==
The Capitalism Magazine website says that, "With a long-term war in progress and threats of further terrorist attacks on American soil," ''Harry Potter'' isn't mere escapism and "shows a world in which happiness can be achieved, villains can be defeated, and the means of success can be learned."&lt;ref&gt;Durante, Dianne. Thank You, Harry Potter! 22 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine says that by ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', "Harry is embroiled in a borderless, semi-civil war with a shadowy, hidden leader whose existence the government ignored until disaster forced the issue and who is supported by a secret network of sleeper agents willing to resort to tactics of shocking cruelty. The kids who grew up on Harry Potter—you could call them [[Generation X|Generation Hex]]—are the kids who grew up with the pervasive threat of terrorism, and it's inevitable that on some level they'll make a connection between the two."&lt;ref name = "Großman" /&gt;

''Slate Magazine''{{'}}s Julia Turner compares ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' to the [[War on Terror]] in the context of the fight against [[Osama bin Laden]] saying Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]'s shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new [[Rufus Scrimgeour|Minister of Magic]] jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and create the impression that he's taking action.&lt;ref name="osama" /&gt;

Rowling said "I've never thought, 'It's time for a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are parallels, obviously. I think one of the times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of [[Stan Shunpike]], you know? I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Melissa | last=Anelli |author2=Emerson Spartz | title=The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two | date=15 July 2005 | url =http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm | work =The Leaky Cauldron | accessdate =9 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[Steven Fielding (political historian)|Steven Fielding]] argues in  ''A State of Play: British Politics on Screen, Stage and Page, from Anthony Trollope to The Thick of It'' that the changing portray of the Ministry of Magic – from incompetent to authoritarian – reflects Rowling's views on the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Fielding.

The site evolved into kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle censorship in general, and to fight for Harry Potter specifically.

===The Harry Potter Alliance===
{{Main article|Harry Potter Alliance}}
Andrew Slack, an actor/comedian and Harry Potter aficionado, co-founded the [[Harry Potter Alliance]] to highlight the crisis in [[Sudan]] and social inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0707/5039.html |title=Harry Potter as a political force |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[In These Times]]'' featured Slack in 2007, in an article about [[Muggle]] Activists where Slack said, "The Harry Potter parallel to [[Darfur]] is simple: With both the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet (the Wizarding World's mainstream news source) in denial that Voldemort has returned and evil is afoot, Harry and his underground rebel group, '[[Dumbledore's Army]],' work with the adult group, '[[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|The Order of the Phoenix]],' to awake the world. We in the Alliance seek to be Dumbledore's Army for the real world, working with anti-genocide organisations, such as 'Fidelity Out of Sudan' and the '[[Genocide Intervention Network]],' to wake our governments, corporations and media up to the fact that 'never again' means 'never again.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slack |first=Andrew |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3365/harry_potter_and_the_muggle_activists/ |title=Harry Potter and the Muggle Activists |publisher=Inthesetimes.com |date=26 October 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine asked about [[The Harry Potter Alliance]], Rowling said, "It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Nancy |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |title=Time Magazine Person of the Year |work=Time |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912150656/www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/1,28804,1690753_1695388_1695436,00.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling awarded [[The Harry Potter Alliance]] a Fan Site Award in December 2007.

In February 2010, the HPA ran a massive fundraiser to support those in dire need after the tragic event of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]]. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those a part of the Harry Potter Fandom) performed and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor [[Tom Felton]], handmade earrings from actress [[Evanna Lynch]], and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by [[Maureen Johnson]] and [[John Green (author)|John Green]]. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. [[Ophelia Dahl]], the daughter of the late British author [[Roald Dahl]] was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standwithhaiti.org/haiti/news-entry/our-partners-in-health-the-harry-potter-alliance-wizards-with-a-cause/ |title=Our partners in health: The Harry Potter Alliance, wizards with a cause &amp;#124; Partners In Health |publisher=Standwithhaiti.org |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[The Harry Potter Alliance]] had a campaign for people to send in their books to the Mississippi Delta which went to [[Rwanda]]. As of June, when the campaign ended, they donated over 40,000 books. In July 2010, The Harry Potter Alliance won $250,000 in the [[Chase Community Giving]] contest. The money will go towards literacy, LGBT rights, and online community building.

===Wal-Mart Watch===
{{Main article|Walmart Watch}}
Wal-Mart Watch uses parodies of Harry Potter to compare [[WalMart]] to Lord Voldemort and draws analogies between House elves and forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://walmartwatch.com/potter/ Harry Potter and the Dark Lord WaldeMart].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stop Big Media===
Stop Big Media gained support from "Rocking Out Against Voldemedia", a compilation of ten original songs by ten Harry Potter-themed "Wizard Rock" bands. Andrew Slack and [[The Harry Potter Alliance]] compare [[media consolidation]] in the U.S. to the control of the Ministry of Magic over the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in the ''Harry Potter'' books, saying "Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the Wizarding World, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called "Potterwatch". Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press."&lt;ref&gt;

A worldwide campaign to "save Harry Potter from the clutches of the Coca-Cola Company" was launched by the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest.

'''Popular Unity''' ({{lang-el|Λαϊκή Ενότητα (ΛΑΕ)}}, ''Laïkí Enótita'', '''LAE''') is a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]{{r|bbc21aug}}&lt;ref name="eki1"/&gt; [[list of political parties in Greece|political party]] in [[Greece]].

Popular Unity was founded on 21 August 2015 by twenty five parliamentarians formerly affiliated to the [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (Syriza),{{r|bbc21aug}} as a reaction to [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]]' handling of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek bailout agreement of 2015]].

[[File:Truppa di Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Truppa di Garibaldi]]

'''Redshirts''' {{in it|Camicie Rosse}} or '''Red coats''' {{in it|Giubbe Rosse}} is the name given to the volunteers who followed [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]] during his [[expedition of the Thousand]] to southern Italy, but sometimes extended to other campaigns of his. The name derived from the color of their shirts or loose fitting blouses (complete uniforms were beyond the finances of the Italian patriots).

==Background==
[[File:Borrani_Cucitrici.png|thumb|upright|left|Sewing red shirts for the volunteers: [[Odoardo Borrani]], ''Cucitrici di camicie rosse'', 1863]]
The red shirts were started by Giuseppe Garibaldi. During his years of exile, Garibaldi was involved in a military action in [[Uruguayan Civil War|Uruguay]], where, in 1843, he originally used red shirts from a stock destined for slaughterhouse workers in [[Buenos Aires]]. Later, he spent time in private retirement in [[New York City]]. Both places have been claimed as the birthplace of the Garibaldian red shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Il lungo Risorgimento: la nascita dell'Italia contemporanea (1770–1922)|last= Pécout|first= Gilles|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Paravia Bruno Mondadori|location= |isbn= 9788842493570|page= |pages= 173|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S1Gf95fGYysC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Camicie+rosse+origini+1843.#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of his force of volunteers in Uruguay, his mastery of the techniques of guerilla warfare, his opposition to the [[Emperor of Brazil]] and [[Argentina|Argentine]] territorial ambitions (perceived by liberals as also imperialist), and his victories in the battles of Cerro and Sant'Antonio in 1846 that assured the independence of Uruguay, made Garibaldi and his followers heroes in Italy and Europe. Garibaldi was later hailed as the "Gran Chico Fornido" on the basis of these exploits.

In Uruguay, calling on the Italians of [[Montevideo]], Garibaldi formed the [[Italian Legion]] in 1843. In later years, it was claimed that in Uruguay the legion first sported the red shirts associated with Garibaldi's "Thousand", which were said to have been obtained from a factory in Montevideo which had intended to export them to the slaughter houses of Argentina. Red shirts sported by Argentinian butchers in the 1840s are not otherwise documented, however, and the famous ''camicie rosse'' did not appear during Garibaldi's efforts in [[Rome]] in 1849–50.

[[Image:Lmille.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Giuseppe Barboglio]] a '''[[Expedition of the Thousand#The Red Shirts|Red Shirt]]''' volunteer of the ''Thousand'' wearing the '''Marsala Medal''']]

Later, after the failure of the campaign for Rome, Garibaldi spent a few years, circa 1850–53, with the Italian patriot and inventor, [[Antonio Meucci]], in a modest [[gothic architecture|gothic]] frame house (now designated a New York City Landmark), on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]], before sailing for Italy in 1853. There is a [[Garibaldi Memorial|Garibaldi-Meucci museum]] on Staten Island.

In New York, during the pre-Civil War era, rival companies of [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firemen]] were the great working-class heroes of the city. Their courage, their civic spirit, and the lively comradeship they demonstrated inspired fanatic followers throughout New York, the original "[[Fire buff|fire buffs]]".
[[File:Monteporzio - Garibaldino.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A typical patriotic communal monument to the ''Garibaldini'', at [[Monte Porzio]]]]
Volunteer fire companies varied in the completeness and details of their uniforms, but they all wore the red flannel shirt. When Garibaldi returned to Italy after his New York stay, the red shirts made their first appearance among his followers.

Garibaldi remained a local hero among European immigrants back in [[History of New York City|New York]]. The "Garibaldi Guard" ([[39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|39th New York State Volunteers]]) fought in the [[American Civil War]], 1861–65. As part of their uniform, they wore red woolen "Garibaldi Shirts"{{snd}} at least, all enlisted men did. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' sized them up:
{{quote|The officers of the Guard are men who have held important commands in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Hungarian]], [[Italian Unification|Italian]], and [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|German]] revolutionary armies. Many of them were in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian]] and [[Second French Empire|French]] armies in the [[Crimean War|Crimea]] and in [[Algeria]].}}

A woman's fashion, the [[Garibaldi shirt]], was begun in 1860 by the [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] of France, and the blousy style remained popular for some years, eventually turning into the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[Waist (clothing)|shirt waist]] and modern woman's [[blouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Julia Ditto, "The Rise of the Shirt Waist", ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', May 1902, pp. 354-357&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuseppe Garibaldi's son, [[Ricciotti Garibaldi]], later led redshirt volunteer troops that fought with the [[Greek Army]] in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] and the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–13.

The Redshirts gave inspiration to [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], to form the [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[blackshirts]] units and, from there, to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s brownshirted [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) units, as well as, the quasi-fascist Irish [[Blueshirts]], under [[Eoin O'Duffy]]. However, whilst being vaguely nationalistic in tone, Garibaldi and his men are not widely considered as having been [[protofascist]]. Nottingham Forest FC now proudly wear the Garibaldi red shirts since their inception in 1865.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15863">'''Regulatory competition''', also called '''competitive governance''' or '''policy competition''', is a phenomenon in [[law]], [[economics]] and [[politics]] concerning the desire of law makers to compete with one another in the kinds of law offered in order to attract businesses or other actors to operate in their jurisdiction. Regulatory competition depends upon the ability of actors such as companies, workers or other kinds of people to move between two or more separate legal systems. Once this is possible, then the temptation arises for the people running those different legal systems to compete to offer better terms than their "competitors" to attract investment. Historically, regulatory competition has operated within countries having federal systems of regulation - particularly the United States, but since the mid-20th century and the intensification of economic [[globalisation]], regulatory competition became an important issue internationally.

One opinion is that regulatory competition in fact creates a "race to the top" in standards, due to the ability of different actors to select the most efficient rules by which to be governed. The main fields of law affected by the phenomenon of regulatory competition are [[corporate law]], [[labour law]], [[tax]] and [[environmental law]]. Another opinion is that regulatory competition between jurisdictions creates a "[[race to the bottom]]" in standards, due to the decreased ability of any jurisdiction to enforce standards without the cost of driving investment abroad.

==History==
The concept of regulatory competition emerged from the late 19th and early 20th century experience with [[charter competition]] among US states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. In 1890 [[New Jersey]] enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower [[franchise tax]]es than other states. [[Delaware]] attempted to copy the law to attract companies to its own state. This competition ended when [[Woodrow Wilson]] as Governor tightened New Jersey's laws again through a series of seven statutes.

In academic literature the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by AA Berle and GC Means in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932) while the concept received formal recognition by the [[US Supreme Court]] in a decision of Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] in the 1933 case ''[[Ligget Co. v. Lee]]''&lt;ref&gt;288 U.S. 517, 558-559 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 Brandeis also coined the term “[[laboratories of democracy]]” in ''[[New State Ice Company v. Liebmann]]'',&lt;ref&gt;285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Federal government was capable of ending experiment.

==Private law==

===Corporate law===
{{See also|Corporate law}}
American corporate law scholars have debated on the role of the regulatory competition on corporate law for more than one decade. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1103644 A Comparative Bibliography]
In the United States legal academia, corporate law is conventionally said to be the product of a "race" among states to attract incorporations by making their corporate laws attractive to those who choose where to incorporate. Given that it has long been possible to incorporate in one state while doing business primarily in other states, US states have rarely been able or willing to use law tied to where a firm is incorporated to regulate or constrain corporations or those who run them. However, U.S. states have long regulated corporations with other laws (e.g., environmental laws, employment laws) that are not tied to where a firm is incorporated, but are based on where a firm does business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

From the "race" to attract incorporations, [[Delaware]] has emerged as the winner, at least among publicly traded corporations. The corporate [[franchise tax]] accounts for between 15% and 20% of the state's budget.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In Europe, regulatory competition has long been prevented by the [[real seat doctrine]] prevailing in [[private international law]] of many [[European Union|EU]] and [[European Economic Area|EEA]] member countries, which essentially required companies to be incorporated in the state where their main office was located. However, in a series of cases between 1999 and 2003 (Centros Ltd. vs. Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen, Überseering BV v Nordic Construction Company Baumanagement GmbH, Kamer van Koophandel en Fabrieken voor Amsterdam v Inspire Art Ltd.), the [[European Court of Justice]] has forced member states to recognize companies chartered in other member states, which is likely to foster regulatory competition in [[European company law]]. For instance, in 2008, Germany adopted new regulations on the GmbH (Limited Liability Company), allowing the incorporation of Limited Liability Companies without a minimum capital of EUR 25,000 (though the earnings have to be retained until this threshold is reached).

===Labour law===
{{See also|Labour law}}
Countries may, for instance, seek to attract [[foreign direct investment]] by enacting a lower [[minimum wage]] than other countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Policy competition for foreign direct investment between asymmetric countries|publisher=European Economic Review|volume=50|issue=7|date=October 2006|pages=1891–1907|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2005.07.002|author1=K Bjorvatn |author2=C Eckel }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by making the labor market more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Haaland, Jan I.  |author2=Wooton, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Multinational Investment, Industry Risk and Policy Competition|date=January 2002|publisher=CEPR Discussion Paper No. 3152|ssrn=298844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental law===
Legal scholars often cite environmental law as a field in which regulatory competition is particularly likely to produce a “race to the bottom” due to the externalities produced by changes in any individual state’s environmental law. Because a state is unlikely to bear all of the costs associated with any environment damage caused by industries in that state, it has an incentive to lower standards below the level that would be desirable if the state were forced to bear all of the costs.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation Interstate Competition: Rethinking the Race to the Bottom Rationale for Federal Environmental Regulation"&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/rubinfeldd/Gersenzee/Revesz_RacetotheBottom.pdf Berkeley Law]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One commonly cited example of this effect is clean air laws, as states may be incentivized to lower their standards to attract business, knowing that the effects of the increased pollution will be spread across a wide area, and not simply localized within the state. Furthermore, a reduction in the standards of one state will incentivize other states to similarly lower their standards so as to not lose business.

==Public services==

===Education===
Sometimes higher-level governing bodies institute incentives to competition among lower-level governing bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Policy Competition in Multilevel Governance|author1=A Benz |author2=A Meincke |publisher=International Workshop "Regional Governance"|year=2005|citeseerx = 10.1.1.134.5357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the [[Race to the Top]] program, designed by the [[United States Department of Education]] to spur reforms in state and local district K-12 education.

The [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] likewise has initiated a program called [[InnoRegio]] to reward innovative practices.

===Health===
The high degree of [[politicization]] of the [[genetically modified organism]] issue made it a key battleground for competition for leadership, particularly between the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council of Ministers]]. The result has been a protracted battle over agenda setting and issue framing and a cycle of competitive regulatory reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Competitive Governance and the Quest for Legitimacy in the EU: the Battle over the Regulation of GMOs since the mid-1990s|author=Yves Tiberghien|doi=10.1080/07036330902782246|publisher=Journal of European Integration|volume=31|issue=3|date=May 2009|pages=389–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
The struggle between insurgents and various [[Afghanistan]] states for power, control, popular support and legitimacy in the eyes of the public has been described as competitive governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Taliban Governance: Can Canada Compete? |url=http://www.seanmmaloney.com/pdfs/TalbanGov.pdf |author1=G Skogstad |author2=A Verdun |publisher=Journal of European Integration |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025208/http://www.seanmmaloney.com/pdfs/TalbanGov.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While during the [[Cold War]] security was provided by centralized institutions such as [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], now competing profit-seeking firms provide personal, national, and international security.&lt;ref name=Kristen&gt;{{cite book|title=The transformation of the European nation state|author1=Per Kristen Mydske |author2=Ingo Peters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[Arnold Kling]] notes, "In [[democratic government]], people take jurisdictions as given, and they elect leaders. In competitive government, people take leaders as given, and they select jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Competitive Government vs. Democratic Government |url=http://patrifriedman.com/saved_papers/kling_competitive_government.2008.pdf |author=Kling, Arnold }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive governance has thus far not produced an ultra-libertarian government; although Zac Gochenour has pointed out the role of potential [[international migrant]]s' [[switching cost]]s in hindering [[consumer choice]] from creating greater intergovernmental competition, [[Bryan Caplan]] has stated that "[t]he bigger problem is that almost all existing governments are either [[non-profit]]s (the [[democracies]]), have short [[time horizon]]s (the [[unstable dictatorship]]s), or reasonably worry that if they liberalize they're lose power (the [[stable dictatorship]]s)." Indeed, it has been argued by Maria Brouwer that most [[autocracies]] prefer stagnation to the vagaries inherent to expansion and other forms of innovation, since the exploration of new possibilities could lead to failure, which would undermine autocratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Democracy and Dictatorship: The Politics of Innovation |author=M Brouwer |year=2006 |url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/bin/278fulltext.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907114031/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/bin/278fulltext.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some question as to whether competitive governance can be revived in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Australia's hollow federalism: can we revive competitive governance?|author=W Kasper|publisher=Institute of Public Affairs Review: A Quarterly Review|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=199981401537291;res=IELBUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Advantages
Brennan and Buchanan (1980) argue that the public sector is a '[[Leviathan]]' which is inherently biased towards extracting money from taxpayers, but that competitive government structures can minimize such exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Local Government Structure and Performance: Lessons from America?|publisher=Public Administration|volume=70|issue=3|pages=333–357|author=Boyne, George A.|date=3 Apr 2007|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119322553/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that a decentralized competitive government structure allows for an experimentation of new public policies without doing too much harm if they fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Decentralized taxation and the size of government: evidence from Swiss state and local governments|author1=LP Feld |author2=G Kirchgässner |author3=CA Schaltegger |year=2003|ssrn=478261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Disadvantages
An alternative to market-based or competitive governance is civic-based or partnership governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Between Market and Civic Governance Regimes: Civicness in the Governance of Social Services in Europe|publisher=Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Non-profit Organizations|issn=0957-8765|volume=20|number=3|date=September 2009|doi=10.1007/s11266-009-9091-2|pages=274–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged disadvantages of competitive governance, compared to collaborative government, include less potential to harness the power of knowledge sharing, cooperation and collaboration within government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Government 2.0?

'''Ronggo''' was an administrative title used by the Dutch in the [[Dutch East Indies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dutch East India Company {{!}} european-heritage.org|url = http://european-heritage.org/netherlands/alkmaar/dutch-east-india-company|website = european-heritage.org|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Indonesia (specifically [[Java]] and [[Borneo]].)

Ronggo of "Afdeeling" Bandjarmasin was held by Kiahi Mas Djaja Samoedra (circa 1899) (EYD or "''advanced spelling''":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What does EYD stand for?|url = http://www.abbreviations.com/EYD|website = www.abbreviations.com|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiai Mas Jaya Samudera). The region saw much international trade with Asia and the Middle East. After a period of warfare dominated much of the late 1500s to mid 1600s, Portugal controlled the area for a short time.

Following Portuguese control, the Dutch East India Company awarded a monopoly on trade and colonization in the area utilizing an exceptional financial backing, better organization, strategy, weapons and ships, but were still unable to completely dominate the Indonesian spice trade. In the 1800s, the Dutch East India Company dissolved due to bankruptcy and the Netherlands turned it into a nationalized colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Page 2: Indonesia Map / Geography of Indonesia / Map of Indonesia - Worldatlas.com|url = http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/id2.htm#page|website = www.worldatlas.com|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14203">The '''''Seattle process''''' or '''''Seattle way'''''&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Development in American Cities: The Pursuit of an Equity Agenda |last=Bennett |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=SUNY Press |quote="The Seattle Way, while time consuming, reflects the city's bias toward openness, accessibility, and citizen participation." |isbn= |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term stemming from the political procedure in [[Seattle]] and [[King County, Washington|King County]], and to a lesser extent other cities and the [[Washington (state)#Law and government|Washington state government]]. The term has no strict definition but refers to the pervasively slow process of dialogue, deliberation, participation, and municipal introspection before making any decision and the time it takes to enact any policy. An early definition came from a 1983 editorial in the ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', "the usual Seattle process of seeking consensus through exhaustion."&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |title=Seattle and the Demons of Ambition: From Boom to Bust in the Number One City of the Future |last=Moody |first=Fred |year=2004 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn= |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other definitions==
"In its positive connotation the Seattle Way values popular participation, transparent process and meaningful debate. More negatively, it has been decried as a culture that values process and debate over results, that bogs down and can't get important things done."—Mark Purcell, Recapturing Democracy.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;{{cite book|title= Recapturing Democracy: Neoliberalization and the Struggle for Alternative Urban Futures|last=Purcell |first=Mark Hamilton |year=2008 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |pages=111, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Seattle Way usually is defined as circular consultation reaching indecision. But it also consists of an uninvolved electorate and public decisions taken carelessly, without regard for experience elsewhere and unmindful of consequence."—Ted Van Dyk, contributing columnist to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer&lt;ref name=VanDyk2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle Way blocks transportation issues|first=Ted|last=Van Dyk|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the election of [[Wes Uhlman]] as mayor in 1969, civic decision making was relatively quick and powerful groups could influence civic leaders without seeking wide consensus.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Economist |volume=361 |pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Expand, how/why did Uhlman change things? --&gt;

Proponents of the Seattle process, such as former city councilman [[Richard Conlin]], praised it as a thoughtful method of generating the best results at the expense of time.&lt;ref name=TimesMay2005&gt;{{cite news |title=Seattle Councilman Conlin flaunting penchant for process |first=Jim |last=Brunner |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=27 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, opponents referred to Conlin in 2005 as the "Duke of Dither" for his devotion to process.&lt;ref name=Balter2005&gt;{{cite news |title=Monorail casts large shadow over City Council races |first=Joni |last=Balter |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=21 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Seattle process became more drawn out, it has been criticized, usually by business interests as too slow and dithering. As an example, during the massive redevelopment of the [[Cascade, Seattle|Cascade]] and [[South Lake Union]] neighborhoods in the early 21st century it was criticized by [[Vulcan Inc.]] and [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] that an in-depth discussion of all of the ideas would wear out the patience of other groups providing [[financial capital]]. Meanwhile, neighborhood activists complained that the proposed development ignored the neighborhood plans that were previously, and laboriously, developed in a consensual process.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt; City neighborhood activists generally like the deliberative process.&lt;ref name=Galloway2006&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle City Council forges dull legacy |quote= "I am sure from the point of view of the downtown let's-get-it-done crowd, this council may deliberate too long. But the much-maligned 'Seattle process' may be a good thing,"|first=Angela |last=Galloway |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=September 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ho2006&gt;{{cite news|title=City urged to pick up pace of decisions |quote= "The argument that this is a 'Seattle way' and a 'Seattle process' is a compliment in many aspects, because the people here have a greater tendency to examine a project and get a better deal," said Kent Cammerer, a Greenwood activist. |first=Vanessa |last=Ho |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process has also been criticized for bland results.&lt;ref name=Galloway2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Westneat2011&gt;{{cite news|title=An outpouring of viaduct love |quote="I have a difficult time imagining that the famous Seattle process could ever come up with anything that exciting,"|first=Danny|last=Westneat|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=Jan 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The Seattle process as an informal method values study, discussion and civic engagement. It will involve numerous stakeholder groups. It requires the community to present effective data, and for organizers to translate data from different constituencies into useful reports for decision makers.&lt;ref name=Whitacre&gt;{{cite book |title=Community perspectives on obesity prevention in children: workshop summaries |last=Whitacre |first=Paula |authorlink= |author2=Annina Catherine Burns |author3=Cathy Liverman  |year=2010 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn= |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using process to seek out consensus and hearing all opinions even extends to the corporate boardroom, not just government.&lt;ref name=Lyke1999&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle will extend a hand in greeting and raise another in protest for WTO  |quote=Decisions are by consensus, and discussions in corporate boardrooms and council chambers can be interminable. This "Seattle Process," it is said, may satisfy everyone but pleases no one. "It's a very frustrating process. People talk forever. But the city does get things done, eventually," says Richard Morrill, a University of Washington professor who has spent decades studying Seattle and its demographics. |first=ML |last=Lyke|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=November 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of participation typically include council meetings, neighborhood forums, ballot measures, and marches. Stakeholder groups are all-inclusive and usually include citizens, corporations, non-profits, neighborhood representatives, and [[identity politics|identity]] or [[advocacy group|issue]] specific groups.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

Despite being called a "process" there is no definitive methodology to the Seattle process; in fact, while writing about Seattle taking four decades to build a light-rail line, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "mysterious and maddening phenomenon".&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009&gt;{{cite news |title=After Years of Debate, Light Rail Trains Enter Town |first=William |last=Yardley |newspaper=New York Times |date=31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the public meetings and methods open to the public, the Seattle process also causes delay while politicians either tinker with, or obstruct, proposals.&lt;ref name=TimesMay2005 /&gt; Other cities in the area declare their ability to get projects because of the lack of Seattle process.&lt;ref name=CheekJune2008&gt;{{cite news|title=Bremerton could teach Seattle a lesson about its waterfront |quote=Mark another reason comparisons may be unfair: no Seattle Process in Bremerton.|first=Lawrence|last=Cheek|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
The Seattle process, and claimed devotion to it, has been an issue in political races. In the 2001 Mayoral Election candidate [[Greg Nickels]] used devotion to Seattle process as an issue against his opponent, city attorney [[Mark Sidran]], who promised a more decisive style.&lt;ref name=nytimes2001&gt;{{cite news |title=Winner Emerges in Seattle Mayor's Race |first=SAM HOWE |last=VERHOVEK |newspaper=New York Times |date=17 November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eight years later Nickel's style as Mayor would be criticized in a re-election race as top-down, autocratic, and antithetical to the Seattle process.&lt;ref name=TimesAug2009&gt;{{cite news |title=Making nice: Seattle mayor's style a primary issue |first=George |last=Tibbits |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''student fee''' is a [[fee]] charged to students at a school, college, university or other place of learning that is in addition to any [[matriculation]] and/or [[Tuition payments|tuition fee]]s. It may be charged to support [[student organization]]s and [[student activities]] (for which it can be called an '''activity fee''') or for [[:wikt:intercollegiate|intercollegiate]] programs such as [[intramural sports]] or [[Visiting scholar|visiting academic]]s; or, at a [[public university]] or college, as a means to remedy shortfalls in [[Subsidy|state funding]] (in which case it can often be called a '''technology fee'''). Further fees may then be charged for features and facilities such as insurance, health and parking provision.

== United States ==

===Constitutionality of activity fees===
In the United States, the [[constitutionality]] of [[:wikt:mandatory|mandatory]] student activity fees has been adjudicated several times by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Most recently, the Court has ruled that public universities may subsidize {{clarify span|campus speech|date=February 2015}} by means of a mandatory student activity fees so long as such fees {{clarify span|are allocated to groups with viewpoint neutrality|date=February 2015}} (see ''[[Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth]]'' {{ussc|529|217|2000}}).
