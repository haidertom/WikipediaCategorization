'''1845 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Baseball]]==
'''Events'''
* 23 September — formal organisation of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club or [[New York Knickerbockers]], initiated by [[Alexander Joy Cartwright]], including adoption of twenty rules. Fourteen of the club rules are the earliest known written rules for playing baseball 
* 22 October — ''New York Morning News'' publishes the first known box score for a baseball game, played at [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 9 September — [[William Thompson (boxer)|William "Bendigo" Thompson]] finally returns to the ring after recovery from his serious knee injury.  He fights [[Ben Caunt]] at Stony Stratford for the Championship of England and is victorious after 93 rounds when Caunt is disqualified for going down without having been struck.  Caunt denies the accusation and announces his retirement, leaving Bendigo as undisputed champion.&lt;ref name="WT"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/thompson.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Bendigo].  Retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* 21 &amp; 22 August — the present [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] is formed at a meeting which takes place at the new [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] during a match between two local teams
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[Fuller Pilch]] 569 @ 21.07 (HS 117)
* Most wickets – [[William Hillyer]] 174 @ 12.30 (BB 8–30)

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* Written version of [[Rugby School]] football rules which allow the ball to be carried and passed by hand.  These rules are the earliest that are definitely known to have been written.  They are a major step in the evolution of [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]]; not to mention [[Australian rules football]], [[American football]], [[Gaelic football]], etc.  The Rugby School rules make a clear distinction between the "handling" game and the "dribbling" game.  Dribbling is running with the ball at one's feet.
* Although [[Eton College]] rules allow the ball to be touched and controlled by hand, they do not allow running with the ball in the hand or passing of the ball by hand.  So, whereas Rugby School has effectively created the first "handling game" rules, Eton could have created the earliest rules of the "dribbling game".
* Introduction of referees at Eton.  Linesmen at the time are called umpires.

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1845 Grand National|Grand National]] – [[Cure-All]]
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Picnic 
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Idas
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[The Merry Monarch]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – Refraction 
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – [[The Baron (horse)|The Baron]]

==[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]==
'''The Boat Race'''
* 15 March — [[Cambridge University Boat Club|Cambridge]] wins the 7th [[The Boat Race 1845|Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]], a revival of the race last contested in 1842

The '''AC75''' ('''America's Cup 75 class''') is a 75-ft [[monohull]] sailboat class, governing the construction and operation of the yachts to be used in the [[2021 America's Cup]]. Conceptual graphics were proposed by the defender on 20 November 2017, and the full Class Rule rule was published on 29 March 2018.&lt;ref group=NB&gt; AC75 Class Rule v1.0 is available at http://cdn.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AC75_Class_Rule.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AC75v1.0&gt; {{cite book |url= http://cdn.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AC75_Class_Rule.pdf |title= AC75 Class Rule v1.0 |authors= Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron; Circolo Della Vela Sicilia; |date= 29 March 2018 |publisher= 36th America's Cup }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the [[2017 America's Cup]], where [[Team New Zealand]]  defeated ''[[Oracle Team USA]]'', it was decided by the winners that the next [[America's Cup]] competition would be sailed in [[Sailing hydrofoil|foiling]] [[monohull]]s in hope to make the sport more attractive to sailors.

==Specifications==
The AC75 has the following maximum specifications.
* LOA: 75 ft (23m)
* Crew 12
One-design elements of the class have been promised, which might make it easier for new and first-time teams to form for the next America’s Cup and still be competitive. ETNZ is to announce the full class rule details next March but has already indicated that the hydraulics, batteries and control hardware for the foils, for example, could be one-design, with scope for development of control system software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yachtingworld.com/americas-cup/111252-111252|title=Radical 75ft flying monohull 'could be fastest America's Cup design ever' - Yachting World|date=2017-11-21|work=Yachting World|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33475">The '''age requirements in gymnastics''' are established by the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG) and regulate the age at which athletes are allowed to participate in senior-level competitions.

In the latter half of the 20th century, a series of controversies arose with regard to gymnast ages, some of them leading to sanctions by FIG, and paving the way for the age requirements to be raised from 14 to 15 in 1981, and then to 16 in 1997.

==History of age requirements in artistic gymnastics==
{{See also|Gymnastics all-around champions by age}}

Prior to [[1981 in sports|1981]], the minimum required age to compete in senior events sanctioned by the FIG (including the [[Gymnastics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]) was 14.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1980 |title=Within the International Federations |journal=Olympic Review |issue=155 |pages=520 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |accessdate=2006-04-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524213018/http://www.la84foundation.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied [[ballet]] for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast [[Ágnes Keleti]] won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. [[Larisa Latynina]], the first great [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 [[World Gymnastics Championships|World Champion]] while pregnant with her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061027054302/http://www.intlgymnast.com/legends/latynina.html "Legends: Larissa Latynina"] ''International Gymnast,'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] gymnast [[Věra Čáslavská]], who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26.&lt;ref name="heroine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=16525|title=Vera Čáslavská: The heroine of Mexico|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2008-07-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080703043503/http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?par_i_id=16525| archivedate= 3 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s — [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]] was sixteen at her first Olympics in [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] — they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased.

By the late 1970s, Federations occasionally requested permission to allow slightly underage athletes to compete as seniors. One such example is that of Canadian gymnast [[Karen Kelsall]], who legally competed in the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] at the age of 13. At the time, gymnasts had to turn 14 by the start of the Games to be eligible. Kelsall, with her December 1962 birthday, was five months shy of the requirement but was turning 14 within the Olympic year, and was granted a special exemption by the FIG to compete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/kelsall.shtml Gymnastics Canada biography of Karen Kelsall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603193852/http://www.gymn.ca/athletes/women/kelsall.shtml |date=2008-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exemptions were not automatic, however: American gymnast [[Tracee Talavera]], who was named to the [[United States]] team for the 1979 World Championships, was deemed ineligible to compete due to her age of 12½ years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/bios/women/talavera.html List of competitive results and bio at Gymn-Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rift&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/NYT-Ages.html "Rift Over Underage Gymnasts"] Neil Amdur, ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the changing demands of the sport, at the 58th Congress of the FIG, held in July 1980 just before the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Olympics]], the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15. Under this rule, which went into effect in 1981, gymnasts were required to turn at least 15 years of age in the calendar year to compete in senior-level events.&lt;ref name=congress /&gt; This age requirement remained in place until 1997, when it was raised one more year, from 15 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/03mar/nb_gym.htm "Female gymnasts: older—and healthier?"] ''The Physician and Sports Medicine,'' Vol. 23 No. 3, March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fake&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1964264.stm "Romanian gymnasts faked age to compete"] BBC News/Europe, May 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for age restrictions==
Age restrictions were supposedly designed not so much to level the playing field in terms of skill and physical advantages, as to protect child athletes from injury. However, critics dispute the science behind the policy and argue that the answer is to prohibit junior gymnasts from competing in senior competitions.

On the one hand, proponents such as [[Jeanne Dopbrak]], a sports medicine physician at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]], contend that "[a child athlete's] immature skeleton just isn't ready to handle the day-to-day stresses that will occur."&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt; and that the stresses imposed on only partly developed muscular/skeletal system by gymnastics are almost certain to cause damage that would persist into adulthood. Proponents also point to a 16-year American study of gymnastics injuries which concluded that gymnastics is the most dangerous sport for girls, with injury rates comparable to those found in boys who play soccer, basketball and hockey.&lt;ref name=TimeApr08-08&gt;{{cite news|first=Alice |last=Park |title=Making Gymnastics Safer for Kids |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728902,00.html |publisher=Time |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917095227/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0%2C8599%2C1728902%2C00.html |archivedate=17 September 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FENetwork&gt;{{cite news |first=Lindsay |last=Hutton |title=Is Gymnastics Right for Your Child? |url=http://life.familyeducation.com/fitness/growth-and-development/57866.html |publisher=Family Education Network |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; An athlete whose bones are still growing is more likely than an adult to suffer skeletal injury, because the bones are more porous and the joints not yet fully formed.&lt;ref name=MBJklenerman&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.|last=Klenerman |title=ABC of Sports Medicine: Musculoskeletal Injuries in Child Athletes|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6943/1556 |journal=[[BMJ]] |date=1994-06-11 |volume=308|pages=1556–9 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080901214552/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6943/1556| archivedate= 1 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no | doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6943.1556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions, which are precursors to stress fractures, occur in 11 percent of young female gymnasts, compared to 2.3 percent of girls and women in general.&lt;ref name=MBJklenerman/&gt; The International Gymnastics Federation says that intense physical activity, such as that engaged in by gymnasts training at the elite level, affects the functioning of growth hormones, possibly causing delayed bone growth and the onset of puberty – although the body is able to recover and catch up later if given rest periods.&lt;ref name=FENetwork/&gt;

==Current regulations==
Currently, per the 1997 regulation, gymnasts must be at least 16 years of age, or turning 16 within the calendar year, to compete in senior-level events. For the current Olympic cycle, in order to compete in the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympics]], a gymnast must have a birth date before January 1, 2001. There is no maximum age restriction, and some gymnasts compete well into their 20s. The oldest female gymnast currently competing in senior international events is Uzbekistan's [[Oksana Chusovitina]],&lt;ref name="ageless"&gt;{{cite web

===Terminology===
The term '''senior''', in gymnastics, refers to any world-class gymnast who is age-eligible under F.I.G. rules. The term '''junior''' is used to describe any gymnast who competes at a world-class level, but does not meet the F.I.G.'s age minimum. Juniors are judged under the same '''Code of Points''' as the seniors, and often exhibit the same level of difficulty in their routines.

===Legal exceptions===
The one exception to the F.I.G.'s age restrictions until recently applied to the year before the Olympics, when gymnasts who were one year below the required age, but would be the required age in the Olympic year, were allowed to compete as seniors at the World Championships and other FIG meets. For instance, gymnasts born in 1977 were allowed to compete at senior events in 1991, when they were 14 or turning 14 within the calendar year. Within the last Olympic cycle, gymnasts born in 1992 were permitted to compete as seniors in 2007. This was permitted to allow nations to qualify to the Olympics with their best teams, and to give emerging gymnasts some experience in major competition before the Olympics. However, the FIG eliminated this exception as of the 2012 Olympic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2007-12/04/content_6297534.htm "Age limits for gymnasts may be set after 2008"] Xinhua News Service, December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the age requirement technically only applies to meets which are sanctioned and regulated directly by the FIG: the Olympics, the World Championships and the World Cup circuit. Many other meets, such as the European Championships, have separate divisions for juniors. Additionally, some competitions, such as the [[Pan-American Games|Pan Am Games]], the Pacific Rim Championships and the [[All-Africa Games]], have different rules which permit seniors and juniors to compete together. There are also numerous international competitions specifically limited to junior gymnasts, such as the Japan Junior International, Moscow World Stars, the Junior Pan American Championships, and the Youth Olympic Games.

===Verification procedures===
According to official statements from the FIG, "the accepted proof of a gymnast’s eligibility for competition is a valid passport issued by the country of residence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gymnast Age Limitations |url=http://209.20.80.25/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0,10869,5195-191062-208285-45462-288055-news-item,00.html |publisher=NIS FIG Office |date=2008-08-09 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821201538/http://209.20.80.25/vsite/vcontent/content/news/0%2C10869%2C5195-191062-208285-45462-288055-news-item%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This verification process has been criticized by some in the gymnastics community, with the argument that countries can manufacture and submit falsified documents for underage athletes.&lt;ref name=apaug2&gt;{{cite news |first=Nancy |last=Armour |title=More questions about Chinese gymnasts' ages|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i0x9UJBzQoVxo1MCC90C2ihzkH8QD92ARRC84 |publisher=Associated Press |date=2008-08-02 |accessdate=2008-08-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080817032305/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i0x9UJBzQoVxo1MCC90C2ihzkH8QD92ARRC84| archivedate= 17 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/tweddle-the-loser-as-age-doubts-mar-hes-triumph-901736.html|title=Tweddle the loser as age doubts mar He's triumph|publisher=''The Independent''|author=Harris, Nick|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2008-08-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080819122617/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/athletics/tweddle-the-loser-as-age-doubts-mar-hes-triumph-901736.html| archivedate= 19 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, gymnasts involved in age falsification have verified that they did in fact compete under forged passports provided to them by their federations.&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;''The Secrets of a Gymnast.''

Since 2009, gymnasts competing in FIG-sanctioned events at both the senior and junior level have been required to have licenses issued by the Federation. These licenses reportedly verify the competitors' ages based on their passports. However, the licensing does not include any independent verification of submitted passport information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-olygymchina10-2008aug10,0,3941558.story |title=More age monitoring for women's gymnastics |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |author=Pucin, Diane |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815004923/http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-olygymchina10-2008aug10%2C0%2C3941558.story |archivedate=15 August 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from coaches and federations===
The age limit is arguably one of the most contentious rules in gymnastics, and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts and members of the media. While some members of the sport, such as former [[USA Gymnastics]] president Bob Colarossi, have expressed support for the age limit of 16, others, such as coach [[Béla Károlyi]], have heavily criticized it.&lt;ref name=old&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000914/ai_n9976865 "Gymnasts are Old-lympians/Golden Girls going for gold in Sydney"] Paula Parrish, ''Colorado Springs Gazette,'' September 14, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the age restrictions have pointed out that it has encouraged older gymnasts to remain in the sport. The average age of an international gymnast was 18.10 years in 2005. In contrast, in 1994, before the new age requirements, it was 16.49, and in 1989, gymnasts who had reached the age of 17 were already often considered to be of retirement age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aipsmedia.com/index.php?page=news&amp;cod=830&amp;tp=n "Gymnasts too young? FIG says the rumor is false"] International Sports Press Association, February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/01/opinion/topics-of-the-times-gymnastic-girls-not-women.html "Gymnastic Girls, Not Women"] ''The New York Times'', August 1, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the rule have countered that by barring younger gymnasts from top level meets, they are denying them valuable competitive experience.&lt;ref name=old /&gt; They have also argued that junior gymnasts perform and are scored under the same ''Code of Points'' as the seniors, perform the same skills, and are thus not avoiding the physical impact of training and performing high-level skills. It is also argued that the current ''Code of Points'', with its increased requirements for difficult skills, is more suited to younger and lighter athletes, and puts older athletes at greater risk of injury.&lt;ref name=nytnew&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Issues of Age Seem to Follow Chinese Gymnasts"] Jere Longman, Juliet Macur. ''The New York Times,'' July 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age falsification==&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Age falsification in gymnastics]]" --&gt;
Age falsification is the practice of [[age fabrication|advancing gymnasts' ages]] to make them age-eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top-level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts.&lt;ref name=fake /&gt;&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt; Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves have come forward and publicly confirmed and verified the falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Silivas, Alexandra Marinescu, Yang Yun, Lavinia Agache, Olga Mostepanova&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press.&lt;ref&gt;Gina Gogean&lt;/ref&gt; Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led to the discovery of age falsification.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Gwang Suk, Lavinia Agache, Olga Bicherova&lt;/ref&gt;

Gymnasts who have had their ages falsified, and have spoken about their experiences, have indicated that they were not given a choice in the matter.&lt;ref name=secrets /&gt; In a 2002 interview, Romanian gymnast [[Daniela Silivaş]], whose age was advanced two years in the 1980s, noted: "One of the officials of the Federation told me 'Look at the passport, from today you're not 13 years old anymore but 15.' Nobody asked me if I agreed to this, I was just a child. They needed gold medals and everybody who was involved in gymnastics knew about these practices."&lt;ref name=prosport /&gt;

While age falsification has been denied among many gymnastics officials, in recent years some have publicly admitted that the practice has occurred. In reference to the falsifications of the early 1990s and 1980s, the head of the [[Romania]]n Gymnastics Federation, Nicolae Vieru, was quoted in 2002: "Changing the ages was a worldwide practice...we copied this from others."&lt;ref name=fake /&gt; The FIG has publicly stated that they view age falsification as an unacceptable practice. However, there have only been three cases, those of [[Kim Gwang Suk]] in 1993 and [[Dong Fangxiao]] and [[Hong Su Jong]] in 2010, where the FIG has elected to take any action against a gymnastics federation for age falsification.&lt;ref name=nytnew /&gt;&lt;ref name=fangxiao /&gt;

===Reasons for age falsification===
According to many scientific and medical studies, as well as reports from ex-gymnasts, younger gymnasts may have psychological or physical advantages in elite gymnastics competition.

Psychologically, younger gymnasts may be more fearless, and have less visceral appreciation for the potential for injury. They are therefore more likely to perform more dangerous, and more highly scored, routines with confidence and steadiness.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Stefano |title=China gymnast underage, AP alleges |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_583045.html |publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2008-08-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823113905/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/s_583045.html |archivedate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Psychologically, I think they worry less,” former Olympic medallist [[Nellie Kim]] told ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=NYTjuly27-08&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeré and Juliet Macur |last=Longman |title=Records Say Chinese Gymnasts May Be Under Age |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210163814/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/sports/olympics/27gymnasts.html| archivedate=December 10, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniela Silivaş, in her interview, commented, "You should know that I competed better at the age of 13 than at 17. I felt much better, physical ''(sic)'' and mentally."&lt;ref name=prosport /&gt;

Physically, younger gymnasts, particularly those who have not yet gone through [[puberty]], tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbbc&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Row over ages of winning gymnasts |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7570000/newsid_7576600/7576667.stm |publisher=BBC/CBBC Newsround |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081005084514/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7570000/newsid_7576600/7576667.stm| archivedate= 5 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] after the 1960s.&lt;ref name=lgipb&gt;{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Joan | title = Little Girls in Pretty Boxes | publisher = Doubleday | location = Garden City | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-385-47790-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more likely to be able to work through pain while injured.&lt;ref name=PTRaug08/&gt;&lt;ref name=lgipb /&gt;

===Major verified cases of age falsification===
'''[[Kim Gwang Suk]]''' ([[North Korea]]): Kim, the 1991 World Champion on the [[uneven bars]], was active on the international circuit between 1987 and 1993. During this time, several observers claimed she was too young for senior competition.  The North Korean Gymnastics Federation submitted inconsistent dates of birth for Kim at various competitions, claiming that she was 15 for three consecutive years. As punishment, the F.I.G. barred the North Korean women's team from the World Championships in 1993.  She competed in the [[1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1989 World Championships]] at the estimated age of 11 or 12.&lt;ref name="iht"&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/04/19/gym.t.php "Gold Medalist and His Team May Be Barred From Olympic Games : Last Chance for a North Korean Athlete"] Christopher Clarey, ''International Herald Times,'' Friday, April 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  However, she may have been younger than that.  At the 1992 Olympics, she claimed she was 17.  However, her front teeth were missing, leading [[Béla Károlyi]] to speculate that she may have been as young as 10 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;NBC coverage of the 1992 Olympics team compulsories&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Beijing Olympics age controversy===

During the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] the age of four Chinese gymnasts — [[He Kexin]], [[Jiang Yuyuan]], [[Deng Linlin]], and [[Yang Yilin]] — was brought into question, with many foreign media outlets speculating that they were underage during the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/sports/olympics/10age.html?ref=olympics | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2008-08-09 | accessdate=2008-10-06 | title=Teeny-Tiny Matter of Age for China’s Gymnasts | last=Macur | first=Juliet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple age investigations were conducted at the urging of media, as well as [[United States Olympic Committee]] executive Jim Scherr and [[International Olympic Committee]] president [[Jacques Rogge]],&lt;ref name="Sydney Herald Controversy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutcheon|first=Stephen |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/off-the-field/ioc-calls-for-probe-into-china-star/2008/08/22/1219262483864.html |title=IOC calls for investigation into gymnast's age |publisher=''smh.com.au''|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2008-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080822122818/http://www.smh.com.au/news/off-the-field/ioc-calls-for-probe-into-china-star/2008/08/22/1219262483864.html| archivedate= 22 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=5632928 | title=International Olympic Committee Investigates Underage Gymnasts Claims  | last=Kent | first=Jo Ling | accessdate=2008-10-06 | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique]] (FIG) found that the gymnasts had met the age requirements and were eligible to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/10/02/sports/OUKSP-UK-GYMNASTICS-CHINA.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2008-10-02 | accessdate=2008-10-06 | title=Officials say Chinese Olympic gymnasts not underage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/sports/AP-OLY-GYM-Underage-Chinese.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports&amp;oref=slogin | title=Ruling Backs Chinese Gymnasts | last=Macur | first=Juliet | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 1, 2008 | accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese sports administration also acknowledged that mistakes in its paperwork have contributed to the misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/sports/olympics/25gymnastics.html | last=Macur | first=Juliet | date=2008-08-24 | title=China Cites Paperwork Error in Age of Gymnast  | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11227">'''Booing''' is an act of showing [[wikt:displeasure|displeasure]] for someone or something, generally in response to an entertainer, by loudly yelling '''boo!''' (and holding the "oo" sound) or making other noises of disparagement, such as hissing. People may make hand signs at the entertainer, such as the [[Thumbs signal|thumbs down]] sign. If spectators particularly dislike the performance they may also accompany booing by throwing objects (traditionally rotten fruit and vegetables) onstage, though the objects may not be meant to physically hurt the performer.

Players booed for their performance felt booing "spooked" or "bothered" them or their teammates, and that it "affected their performance". [[Nick Swisher]] stated "It hurts. Sometimes I’m a sensitive guy and some of the things people say, they get under your skin a little bit.". [[Ledley King]] stated, "It just frustrates me when the crowd boo England, who is that going to help? It just heaps more pressure on the players and gives us even less of a chance of scoring". However, the counterargument goes that the combination of booing and applause help keep the quality of public performance high, by emotionally rewarding the good and punishing the bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yankee Stadium boos "spooked a lot of guys" according to anonymous Yankee |author=Aaron Gleeman |publisher=NBC Sports: Hardball Talk |date=October 19, 2012 |url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/10/19/yankee-stadium-boos-spooked-a-lot-of-guys-according-to-anonymous-yankee/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yankees' Nick Swisher says fans blamed him for Derek Jeter's injury after he misplayed ball in right field during Saturday's ALCS Game |author=Peter Botte|publisher=New York Daily News|date=October 14, 2012|quote="It hurts.

Booing is not always a judgement of performance, but can be an expression of disapproval of a third party. Sometimes this is even encouraged, such as at [[The Game Awards 2015]], when the audience [[Konami#Kojima_Productions|booed in disapproval]] at the announcement that Konami legally barred [[Hideo Kojima]] from making an appearance. Host [[Geoff Keighley]] agreed with the sentiment, saying, "it’s disappointing and it’s inconceivable to me that an artist like Hideo would not be allowed to come here and celebrate with his peers and his fellow teammates.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klepek|first1=Patrick|title=Geoff Keighley: Konami Barred Hideo Kojima From Accepting Metal Gear Award|url=http://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-konami-barred-hideo-kojima-from-accepti-1746111339|website=Kotaku|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

In [[sports]], booing by fans is quite common. They may boo particularly-hated players on the opposing team, or any opposing player when there is an intense rivalry between the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Sporting News |title=Home Run Derby 2012: Fans' treatment of Robinson Cano strengthens case for changes|author=Anthony Witrado |date=July 9, 2012|quote="Kansas City fans mercilessly booed New York Yankees second baseman and American League captain Robinson Cano on Monday night, cheering with passion every time he made an out and even louder when he was shut out in the contest at Kauffman Stadium."|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/mlb/feed/2012-07/eye-on-mlb/story/home-run-derby-2012-results-prince-fielder-jose-bautista-robinson-cano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsportsmanlike behavior is also booed, such as intentionally hitting home team batters in baseball or diving in [[association football]] or basketball (where it is a technical foul). Booing of [[referee]]s or [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]]s after an unpopular ruling is also common. Booing of expelled players after receiving a second yellow card or a direct red card is also common for many reasons. In professional sports, one's own home team, players or coach may be booed due to a poor performance or season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NY Daily News |title=Derek Jeter hears the boos during Thursday's loss to Red Sox |author=Peter Botte |date=July 7, 2008 |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-07-03/sports/17902436_1_jon-lester-bottom-line-red-sox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Daily News |title=Boo birds serenade Knicks in loss to 76ers|author=Peter Botte |date=March 11, 2012 |quote="Carmelo Anthony heard noticeable boos during pre-game introductions, but Mike D'Antoni and the rest of the Knicks deservedly felt the crowd’s wrath, too, for the ugliness that transpired thereafter Sunday afternoon at the Garden. The negativity got so bad late in the Knicks' fifth straight loss, portions of the crowd chanted "Fire D'Antoni"—the natural progression from the boos that poured down from the stands through much of the second half." |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-03-11/news/31146227_1_mike-d-antoni-anthony-nor-stoudemire-sixers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
* [[Adam Goodes]] who played for the [[Sydney Swans]] in the [[Australian Football League]] was repeatedly and loudly booed by opposition fans during the [[2015 AFL season]] at most of the matches whenever he touched the ball. During a match against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], during the AFL's annual Indigenous Round, after he kicked a goal, he celebrated the goal by provoking the Carlton fans by performing an Indigenous war dance in which he mimed throwing a spear in their direction. Afterwards, Goodes claimed that the dance was based on the one he learned from the under-16s indigenous team the [[Flying Boomerangs]], and that it was intended as an expression of indigenous pride during Indigenous Round, not with the intention of offending and intimidating the crowd. The booing escalated after the war dance.

* Brazilian motor racing driver [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] was booed when, after winning the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]], he chose to drink [[orange juice]] instead of the [[milk]] traditionally drunk by winners of the race. Fittipaldi had made the move in order to promote the Brazilian citrus industry.

* During [[professional wrestling]] matches, most [[Heel (wrestling)|heels]] traditionally receive boos from the audience as the villain. Ability to infuriate audiences and draw "heat" (negative reactions such as boos and jeers) are considered essential skills for heel performers.

==Politics==

In the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], booing is officially not permitted; ''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice|Erskine May]]'' states: "Members must not disturb a Member who is speaking by hissing, chanting, clapping, booing, exclamations or other interruption."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Wheeler, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32913113 Why are MPs banned from clapping?], BBC (May 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, jeering and heckling are somewhat common during [[Prime Minister's Questions]].&lt;ref&gt;Justin Parkinson, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26239991 Is Prime Minister's Questions really getting worse?], BBC News (February 18, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular Culture==

Although rare, in the [[performing arts]], [[opera]] remains one of the arts where booing remains, if not common, customary as merited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=NY Times |title=The Boos in the Balcony, and Their Targets |author=Michael Cooper |date=July 16, 2015  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/arts/music/the-boos-in-the-balcony-and-their-targets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Nude rape scene booed by Royal Opera House audience |date=June 30, 2015  |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33324759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times |title=At the Met, a Hun Who Struggles to Conquer His Doubts |author=Anthony Tommasini |date=February 24, 2010 |quote="During the ovations Mr. Audi and his designers received a loud round of boos from a segment of the audience, which seemed to miff Mr. Muti." |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/arts/music/25attila.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In orchestral music, booing is usually restricted to the premiere of a new work.  

Rarer still is for motion pictures to be booed at their openings, and this is usually confined to [[film festivals]] when the production team is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=Time |title=Review: Ryan Gosling’s Lost River: Crazy Like a Rat |author=Richard Corliss |date=May 20, 2014  |quote="First came the boos, like an owl symphony, or a cattle crescendo. Then, a smattering of defiant applause. Then, the boos again. The antiphonal response could have gone on all afternoon, with catcalls winning in a landslide, but the critics had other movies to see." |url=http://time.com/106139/lost-river-ryan-gosling-cannes-movie-review/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional British [[pantomime]], "the villain will generally include some abuse of the audience to stimulate hissing and booing" while the fairy and other protagonists are cheered.&lt;ref&gt;Millie Taylor, ''British Pantomime Performance'' (Intellect Ltd 2007), pp. 127-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==

The film ''[[The_Princess_Bride_(film)|The Princess Bride]]'' uses booing to show shame. Princess Buttercup dreams of her wedding with Humperdinck when an elderly woman interrupts:
{{Quote
|text=Your true love lives and you marry another? True love saved her in the Fire Swamp, and she treated it like garbage! And that's what she is! The Queen of Refuse! So bow down to her if you want! Bow to her! Bow to the Queen of Slime! The Queen of Filth! The Queen of Putrescence! Boo! Boo! Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo! Boo!
}}
The book ''Dreams on Film: The Cinematic Struggle Between Art and Science'' says this scene might be better labeled "Buttercup Unconsciously Booing Herself"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halpern|first1=Leslie|title=Dreams on film : the cinematic struggle between art and science|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C. u.a.|isbn=978-0786415960|pages=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Booing&amp;action=submit#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Basketball League''' ('''CBL''') is a professional [[basketball]] minor league based around the [[Greater Toronto Area]] of Southern Ontario. The CBL was founded in July 2014 by former [[NBA]] coach [[Butch Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/sports/basketball/ex-raptors-coach-butch-carter-pushing-a-dream-of-a-new-canadian-basketball-league|title=Ex-Raptors coach Butch Carter pushing a dream of a new Canadian Basketball League|last=|first=|date=12 December 2014|website=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/20/butch-carter-pitching-startup-canadian-basketball-league-but-will-he-find-sponsors.html|title=Butch Carter pitching startup Canadian Basketball League, but will he find sponsors?|last=|first=|date=20 January 2015|website=Toronto Star|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/butch-carter-says-canadian-basketball-league-to-start-small--grow-sustainably-204814384-nba.html|title=Butch Carter says Canadian Basketball League to start small, grow sustainably|last=|first=|date=21 May 2015|website=Yahoo Sports Canada|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The four founding member teams were Durham United, Hamilton United, Scarborough and Wellington. Teams play a 24-game regular season followed by league playoffs.

The CBL was to begin play for the 2015–16 season with four teams. That plan was put on hold when a home arena could not be secured for the Hamilton franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/sports-story/6243789-carter-s-pro-hoops-league-put-on-ice-this-season/|title=Carter's pro hoops league put on ice this season|last=|first=|date=21 January 2016|website=Waterloo Region Record|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBL began their inaugural season in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/7004419-hamilton-united-to-debut-in-new-canadian-basketball-league/|title=Hamilton United to debut in new Canadian Basketball League|last=|first=|date=5 December 2016|website=Hamilton Spectator|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/sports-story/7006492-carter-s-basketball-league-launches-without-waterloo/|title=Carter's basketball league launches without Waterloo|last=|first=|date=6 December 2016|website=Waterloo Region Record|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarborough defeated Wellington 79-75 in the first-ever league game played at the [[Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre]] on December 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guelphmercury.com/sports-story/7019728-canadian-basketball-league-excited-for-tip-off-in-guelph/|title=Canadian Basketball League excited for tip-off in Guelph|last=|first=|date=14 December 2016|website=Guelph Mercury Tribune|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidetoronto.com/photogallerypopup/7035802|title=First-ever Canadian Basketball League game|last=|first=|date=19 December 2016|website=Inside Toronto|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44323">'''Cheating in chess''' refers to a deliberate violation of the [[rules of chess]] or other unethical behaviour that is intended to give an unfair advantage to a player or team. Cheating can occur in many forms&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/sports/othersports/08chess.html?ex=1312689600&amp;en=5292ff7841b05021&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Cheating Accusations in Mental Sports, Too|accessdate=2007-01-01 | work=The New York Times | date=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can take place before, during, or after a game. Commonly cited instances of cheating include: collusion with spectators or other players, use of chess engines, rating manipulation, and violations of the [[touch-move rule]]. Many suspiciously motivated practices are not comprehensively covered by the rules of [[chess]]. On ethical or moral grounds only, such practices may be judged by some as acceptable, and by others as cheating.

Even if an arguably unethical action is not covered explicitly by the rules, article 11.1 of the [[FIDE]] laws of chess states: "The players shall take no action that will bring the game of chess into disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=171&amp;view=article|title=Laws of Chess|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while deliberately sneaking a captured piece back onto the board may be construed as an illegal move that is sanctioned by a time bonus to the opponent and a reinstatement of the last legal position, the rule forbidding actions that bring chess into disrepute may also be invoked to hand down a more severe sanction such as the loss of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/geurt58.pdf|title=Unusual Events or Are There Still Normal Games?|last=Gijssen|first=Geurt|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=30 July 2012}} (see answer to question by J. Roberts on p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
Cheating at chess is almost as old as the game itself, and may even have caused chess-related deaths. According to one legend, a dispute over cheating at chess led King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] to murder a Danish nobleman.&lt;ref name="CP1-4"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA136&amp;lpg=RA3-PA136&amp;dq=canute+ulf+chess&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ne27GJsMFQ&amp;sig=oJo7D-d16b2hnb8Fnk-yR497clU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=byFETruHLY3UiAKqrc3KAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=canute%20ulf%20chess&amp;f=false|title=Chess Player, Volumes 1-4|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most anthologized chess stories is ''Slippery Elm'' (1929) by [[Percival Wilde]], which involves a ruse to allow a weak player to beat a much stronger one, using messages passed on [[Ulmus rubra#Medicinal|slippery-elm]] throat lozenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-12-19/cheating-at-chess-and-other-pastimes|title=Cheating at Chess and Other Pastimes|date=19 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television shows have engaged the plot of cheating in chess, including episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0649205|title="Mission: Impossible" A Game of Chess (TV Episode 1968)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539781|title="Cheers" Indoor Fun with Sammy and Robby (TV Episode 1990)|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In televised shows based on humourist [[Tenali Rama]] (a real-life personality who lived under king [[Krishnadeva Raya]], ruler of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijaynagar]] during its most prosperous period), a loud-mouthed chess "unbeatable champion" (who mostly depends on winning by cheating) takes advantage of the emperor's sleep due to boredom and starts shouting along with followers (who have accompanied him from an opponent kingdom), successfully convincing the assembly that he has won.

In [[Satyajit Ray]]'s [[Shatranj ke Khiladi]] (one of only two Hindi films he made – both based on short-stories by [[Premchand]]), Mirja Sajjad Ali, fed-up by his opponent's childish playing habits, has to make rules that only the piece intended to be played should be touched, and taking more than five minutes to move  should simply mean defeat. (As [[chess clock]]s are ''still'' practically unknown  even in modern India, it was out of question during the middle of 19th century — the period in which the film is set.){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Automaton hoaxes===
In contrast to the modern methods of cheating by playing moves calculated by machines, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the public were hoaxed by the opposite deception in which machines played moves of hidden humans. The first and most famous of the chess automaton hoaxes was [[The Turk]] (1770), followed by [[Ajeeb]] (1868), and [[Mephisto (automaton)|Mephisto]] (1886).

==Collusion==
Over the years, there have been many accusations of collusion, either of players deliberately losing (often to help a friend or teammate get a [[Chess title|title norm]]), or of players [[draw by agreement|agreeing to draws]] to help both players in a [[chess tournament|tournament]]. One of the earliest evidences is with the Fifth American Chess Congress in 1880, when [[Preston Ware]] accused James Grundy of reneging on a deal to draw the game, with Grundy instead trying to play for a win.&lt;ref name="spinrad1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad08.pdf|title=The Scandal of 1880, Part One|date=28 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228235045/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad08.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spinrad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad09.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=28 February 2006|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228235045/http://www.chesscafe.com/text/spinrad09.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newspaper article contemporary to the event stated, "Ware’s avowal of his right to sell a game in a tourney was a novelty in chess ethics ... Ware’s veracity has not been questioned, only his obliquity of moral vision ..."&lt;ref name="spinrad1" /&gt; Six prior allegations of similar collusion and bribery, including another against Ware, were listed from 1876 to 1880 in that article on the Ware-Grundy affair, which was published in the ''Brooklyn Eagle'' on February 8, 1880.&lt;ref name="spinrad1" /&gt; More recently, researchers at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] have claimed, based on their analysis of statistical tests of match records against economic models, that Soviet chess masters may have colluded in world chess championships held from 1940 to 1964.&lt;ref name="wusl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-info.wustl.edu/tips/page/normal/7935.html|title=Cheating in world chess championships is nothing new, study suggests|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoulNye"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=905612|title=Did the Soviets Collude? A Statistical Analysis of Championship Chess 1940–64|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Washington University study argues from the researchers' statistical findings that Soviet players may have agreed to draws between themselves to improve their standings.

Opinions differ over how effective collusion may be. For example, if a leading player draws his game, it may allow his rivals to gain ground on him by winning their games.  The most infamous alleged instance, the 1962 [[Candidates' Tournament]], is discussed further at the ''[[World Chess Championship 1963]]'' article.

In 2011, IM [[Greg Shahade]] wrote that "prearrangement of results is extremely commonplace, even at the highest levels of chess.  This especially holds true for draws... There is a bit of a code of silence at the top levels of chess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uschess.org/content/view/11247/632|title=The United States Chess Federation - Greg on Chess: the Trouble with Round-Robins|first=Jennifer|last=Shahade|website=www.uschess.org|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject had been partially broached (in the USA context) by [[Alex Yermolinsky]] a few years earlier, saying "It's no secret how people act when facing a last-round situation when a draw gives no prize ...  People will just dump games, period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2004/08/reality-check.htm|title=Reality Check - The Daily Dirt Chess News Blog|website=www.chessninja.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning an incident involving 2006 US Championship qualification, Shahade blamed the [[Swiss-system tournament|Swiss system]] for creating perverse incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessninja.com/dailydirt/2006/01/cheating-heart-attack.htm|title=Cheating Heart Attack - The Daily Dirt Chess News Blog|website=www.chessninja.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederic Friedel reported that the PCA had considered running a series of open tournaments in 1990s, but for similar reasons given by [[John Nunn]] ultimately declined, saying that deliberately losing games was "very real in the many open tournaments that are staged all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-bilbao-draw-feedback-from-our-readers|title=The Bilbao Draw – feedback from our readers|date=6 November 2007|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch-move rule==
{{see also|Touch-move rule}}
In chess, the "touch-move" rule states that if a player (whose turn it is to move) touches one of his [[chess piece|pieces]], it must be moved if it has a legal move. In addition, if a piece is picked up and released on another square, the move must stand if it is a legal move. If an opponent's piece is touched, it must be captured if it is legal to do so. These rules are often difficult to enforce because the only witnesses are the two players themselves. Nevertheless, violations of these rules are considered to be cheating.&lt;ref&gt;"When the man in the street hears of someone cheating at chess...usually involve a violation of article 7 of the Laws of Chess, usually called the 'touch-move' rule.", Lombardy &amp; Daniels, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"He stuttered, ''J'adoube'', and moved another piece instead, which is commonly known as cheating.", Evans, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

In one famous instance, [[Garry Kasparov]] changed his move against [[Judit Polgár]] in 1994 after momentarily letting go of a piece. Kasparov went on to win the game. The tournament officials had video records proving that his hand left the piece, but refused to release the evidence. A factor counting against Polgár was that she waited a whole day before complaining, and such claims must be made during the game. The videotape revealed that Kasparov did let go of the piece for one-quarter of a second. Cognitive psychologist Robert Solso stated that it is too short a time to make a conscious decision.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, pp. 284–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous incident occurred in a game between [[Milan Matulović]] and [[István Bilek]] at the [[World Chess Championship 1969|Sousse Interzonal]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1027634|title=Milan Matulovic vs Istvan Bilek (1967)|website=www.chessgames.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matulović played a losing move but then took it back after saying "J'adoube" ("I adjust"—which should be announced ''before'' adjusting pieces on their square). His opponent complained to the [[list of chess terms#Arbiter|arbiter]] but the modified move was allowed to stand. This incident earned Matulović the nickname "J'adoubović".&lt;ref&gt;Hooper and Whyld, p. 252, says "...he played in the Sousse Interzonal in which, after a little cheating (see j'adoube), he came ninth."  p. 185 (the "j'adoube" entry) says: "...withdrew a losing move saying "Ich spreche j'doube"; this ruse went unpunished...."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 European Championship saw a "[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1263244 takeback game]" between [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] and [[Vladimir Malakhov (chess player)|Vladimir Malakhov]], who eventually finished first and second in the event. To quote the book ''Smart Chip'' by [[Genna Sosonko]]:&lt;ref&gt;Smart Chip From St Petersburg (and other tales from a bygone chess area), published by New in Chess, June 2014, {{ISBN|9789056914875}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Both grandmasters were fighting for the lead, and the encounter had huge sporting significance. In an ending that was favourable to him, Azmai[parashvili] picked up the bishop, intending to make a move with it instead of first exchanging rooks. Malakhov recalled: "Seeing that the rooks were still on the board, he said something like, "Oh, first the exchange, of course." put his bishop back, took my rook, and the game continued. I don't know what should have been done differently in this situation—in Azmai's place, some might have resigned immediately, and in my place, some would have demanded that he make a move with his bishop but I didn't want to ruin the logical development of the duel, so I didn't object when Azmai made a different move: the mistake was obviously nothing to do with chess! When we signed the score sheets, Azmai suggested to me that we consider the game a draw. After the game I was left with an unpleasant aftertaste, but that was due mainly to my own play."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cheating with technology==
Technology has been used by chess cheats in several ways. Perhaps the most common way is to use a chess program while playing chess remotely, e.g., on the Internet. Another type of cheating, with the aim of boosting one's rating on an Internet chess site, is to sign on with a different [[IP address]] and user name (a form of [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppetry]]) to play and lose against themselves. Electronic communication with an accomplice during face-to-face competitive chess is another reported type of cheating. Games can be analyzed after the fact to give a probabilistic determination on whether a player received surreptitious help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Catch A Chess Cheater|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/21/324222845/how-to-catch-a-chess-cheater|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents===
Due to the great multiplication of technological cheating incidents, the following examples concentrate only on those that are either at a high level, or are of historical significance.

====High-profile====
* In the [[39th Chess Olympiad|2010 FIDE Olympiad Tournament]] at [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], three French players were caught in a scheme to use a computer program to decide moves. Their plan involved one player, Cyril Marzolo, following the tournament at home and using the computer program to decide the best moves. He would send the moves by SMS to the team coach, Arnaud Hauchard, who would then stand or sit at various tables as a signal to the player, [[Sébastien Feller]], to make a certain move. Sébastien Feller was given a two-year and nine months suspension, Cyril Marzolo was given a one-year and six-month suspension, and Arnaud Hauchard was given a three-year suspension by the FIDE Ethics Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.europe-echecs.com/actualites/sanctions-confirmees-par-la-fide-4411.html|title=Sanctions confirmées par la FIDE|publisher=[[Europe Échecs]]|date=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other cases, each player involved was a legitimate Grandmaster or International Master. None of the other players on the team knew of this or were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= FIDE Ethics Commission suspends Hauchard, Feller and Marzolo | url=http://www.chessdom.com/fide-ethics-commission-suspends-hauchard-feller-and-marzolo|accessdate=22 November 2014 |publisher=chessdom |date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cheating chess champ banned | publisher=connexionfrance |url=http://connexionfrance.com/Chess-cheat-Feller-banned-world-champion-grand-master-SMS-text-12600-view-article.html |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scandals of [[Borislav Ivanov]] were a cause celebre in the chess world in 2012 and 2013, with first cheating being alleged at the Zadar Open, and then Kyustendil. He was banned for four months by the Bulgarian Chess Federation, though this ban was overturned due to procedural defects, and was not based upon the cheating allegations, but rather Ivanov's rude behavior toward his accusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btv.bg/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/video/615096686-bTV_Reporterite_Borislav_Ivanov__vinoven_do_dokazvane_na_protivnoto.html|title=bTV Репортерите: Борислав Иванов - виновен до доказване на противното|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009132856/http://www.btv.bg/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/video/615096686-bTV_Reporterite_Borislav_Ivanov__vinoven_do_dokazvane_na_protivnoto.html#|archive-date=9 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-79.com/news-64768.html|title=Съдът оневини благоевградския шахматист Борислав Иванов|first=Developed by Motion Limited|last=(http://www.motion.bg)|website=www.e-79.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After various interludes, he was banned permanently by the Bulgarian Chess Federation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/sport/2013/12/24/2209570_seriiniiat_izmamnik_borislav_ivanov_e_izkljuchen_ot|title="Серийният измамник" Борислав Иванов е изключен от българския шахмат|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents were significant as they were one of the first times that statistical methods were used to analyze move-matching with computer programs, even though in the end such evidence was never used in a formal legal procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessprofessionals.org/content/open-letter-kenneth-w-regan-cheating-chess|title=Open Letter from Kenneth W.

* In April 2015, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Gaioz Nigalidze]] was banned from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament after officials discovered him consulting a [[smartphone]] with [[chess software]] in the [[washroom]] during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/sport/chess-championship-cheating-in-bathroom/index.html|title=Chess grandmaster cheats ... from the bathroom|first=Holly Yan|last=CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/15-chess-news/8675-dubai-bans-georgian-chess-champion-caught-cheating-at-dubai-open-chess-tournament.html FIDE: Dubai bans Georgian Chess Champion Caught Cheating at Dubai Open Chess Tournament], 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was later stripped of his grandmaster title and banned from competition for three years, though he was allowed to keep his [[International Master]] title.&lt;ref&gt;FIDE Ethics commission, [http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2015/FIDE_News/Ethics_case_7_2015_Decision.pdf Case n. 7/2015: ''Allegations of Cheating against GM Nigalidze in Dubai Open, 2015''], 4 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical====
* One of the earliest known cases of using technology to cheat occurred in the 1993 [[World Open chess tournament|World Open]]. An unrated newcomer wearing headphones used the name "John von Neumann" (matching the name of a [[John von Neumann|famous computer science pioneer]]), and scored 4½/9 in the Open Section, including a draw with a [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] and a win over a 2350-[[ELO rating system|rated]] player. This player seemed to have a suspicious bulge in one of his pockets, which appeared to make a soft humming or buzzing sound at important points in the game. When he was quizzed by the tournament director, he was unable to demonstrate even a rudimentary knowledge of some simple chess concepts, and he was disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3605|title=Minutes of the Chess Cheating conference in New York|date=2007-01-11|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1998 Böblinger Open saw Clemens Allwermann latterly accused of cheating using [[Pocket Fritz|Fritz]], and after an investigation by the district attorney was inconclusive as to the evidence, the Bavarian Chess Federation barred him from participating in future tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/a-history-of-cheating-in-che-3-|title=A history of cheating in chess (3)|date=18 December 2011|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Lampertheim Open Tournament 2002 the arbiter announced the disqualification of a player before round seven. Markus Keller explained what had happened:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/scandal-in-lampertsheim-cheating-in-the-loo|title=Scandal in Lampertsheim – cheating in the loo|date=7 January 2003|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;In the sixth round a player came to me and said he suspected his opponent, W.S. from L., was using illicit aids during the game. He often left the board for protracted periods of time to go to the toilet, even when (especially when) it was his turn to play. He had done this in earlier rounds against other players as well. I watched W.S. and noticed that he played a number of moves very rapidly and then disappeared in the toilet. I followed him and could hear no sound coming from the stall. I looked under the door and saw that his feet were pointing sideways, so that he could not have been using the toilet. So I entered the neighbouring stall, stood on the toilet bowl and looked over the dividing wall. I saw W.S. standing there with a handheld PC which displayed a running chess program. He was using a stylus to operate it. I immediately disqualified the player. When confronted he claimed that he was only checking his emails, so I asked him to show me the computer, which he refused to do. There are witnesses for my investigation in the toilet, and we will ask the chess federation of our state to ban the player from playing in other tournaments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In the HB Global Chess Challenge 2005 (in Minneapolis, Minnesota), a player in the Under-2000 section exited the event under suspicion of cheating, while his final-round game was under way. According to tournament officials, he was caught repeatedly talking on his cell phone during his game—which the published rules for that event expressly prohibited. Directors suspected that he was receiving moves over the phone from an accomplice elsewhere in the building. His results were expunged from the tournament and an ethics complaint lodged. Six weeks later, the same player entered the World Open and tied for first through third place in the Under-2200 section, pocketing $5,833. An attempt was made to eject him midway through that event, when the organizers belatedly learned about the earlier incident in Minnesota. But, lacking any specific allegation that he was cheating in the World Open, they backtracked and re-admitted him after he threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorchess.zoomshare.com/3.html |title=Blockade Chess Cheaters  USCF Petition |publisher=SeniorChess |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160021/http://www.seniorchess.zoomshare.com/3.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Subroto Mukerjee memorial international rating chess tournament 2006, an Indian chess player was banned from playing competitive chess for ten years due to cheating.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1061212/asp/jamshedpur/story_7127264.asp|title=Verdict on chess cheating this week|accessdate=2014-01-21 | location=Calcutta, India|work=The Telegraph|date=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tournament at Subroto Park, [[Umakant Sharma]] was caught receiving instructions from an accomplice using a [[chess computer]] via a [[Bluetooth]]-enabled device which had been sewn into his cap.&lt;ref name="the hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/06/stories/2006120612002200.htm|title=Player expelled for technology misuse|accessdate=2006-12-28 | location=Chennai, India|work=The Hindu|date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-122706"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/27/chess.cheater.reut/index.html |title=Chess player caught cheating with wireless device |accessdate=2006-12-28 |work=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101060744/http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/12/27/chess.cheater.reut/index.html |archivedate=1 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His accomplices were outside the building, and were relaying moves from a computer simulation. Officials became suspicious after Sharma had made unusually large gains in rating points during the previous 18 months, even qualifying for the national championship.&lt;ref name="cnn-122706"/&gt; Umakant began the year with an average rating of 1933, and in 64 games gained over 500 points to attain a rating of 2484. Officials received multiple written complaints alleging that Umakant's moves were in exactly the same sequence suggested by the chess computer.&lt;ref name="the hindu"/&gt;  Eventually, in the seventh round of the tournament, [[Indian Air Force]] officials searched the players on the top eight boards with a metal detector and found that Umakant was the only player who was cheating. Umakant's ten-year ban was imposed by the All India Chess Federation (AICF) after reviewing evidence presented by Umakant himself and the electronic devices seized by the tournament organizers.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;  The penalty was considered harsh, especially considering that those in other sports who have been found to be [[Doping (sport)|doping]] and [[match fixing]] did not receive such lengthy suspensions.&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200612271550.htm |title=Umakant Shama banned for 10 years |accessdate=2006-12-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103191122/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/007200612271550.htm |archivedate=3 January 2007 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When officials were asked about the suspension they stated, "We wanted to be frank and send a stern message to all players. It is like cheating on exams."&lt;ref name="hindu"/&gt;
* In the Philadelphia World Open 2006, Steve Rosenberg, who was playing in a lower section, was leading before the final round. A victory would have been worth about $18,000. He was confronted by a tournament director and found to be using a wireless transmitter and receiver called a "Phonito". He was disqualified from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3280|title=Cheating Accusations at the World Open|date=2006-08-10|publisher=ChessBase|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a Dutch League 2C 2007 match between Bergen op Zoom and AAS, the arbiter caught the team captain of AAS (who was playing on board 6) using a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]. The player was outside the playing hall, with permission, to get some fresh air. The arbiter had followed him and caught him using [[Pocket Fritz]]. On the screen, the actual position of the game was shown. The arbiter declared the game lost and informed the Dutch Federation about the incident. The competition manager communicated a heavy penalty: the player was banned from playing in the Dutch League and Cup matches, not only for that season, but also for the next two seasons. The competition manager applied article 20.3 of the Federation's competition regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/dutch-chess-player-banned-after-using-pocketfritz/|title=Dutch chess player banned after using PocketFritz|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2007-11-09|publisher=ChessVibes.com|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Dubai]] Open 2008, M. Sadatnajafi, an untitled Iranian player (rated 2288 at the time), was disqualified from the tournament after he was caught receiving suggested moves by [[text message]] on his [[mobile phone]] while playing Grandmaster [[Li Chao (chess player)|Li Chao]].&lt;ref name="Dubai2008"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wesley So wins Dubai Open, player disqualified for cheating | publisher=[[ChessBase]] | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4570 |  accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was being relayed live over the Internet and it was alleged that his friends were following it and guiding him using a computer.&lt;ref name="Dubai2008"/&gt;
* In the Norths Chess Club Centenary Year Under 1600 Tournament a 14-year-old boy was caught using what the arbiter called a "hand-held machine" in the toilets. The game was declared lost and the boy was expelled from the tournament. He was using the program [[Chessmaster]] on a [[PlayStation Portable]], and that was probably the reason why the moves were not particularly strong. It was the first example of a chess player getting caught while using an electronic device in Australia, and so it quickly became a big story in the relatively small Australian chess community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvibes.com/reports/is-cheating-always-newsworthy/|title=Is cheating always newsworthy|last=Doggers|first=Peter|date=2009-01-08|publisher=ChessVibes|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[German Chess Championship]] 2011, FM Christoph Natsidis used a chess program on his [[smartphone]] during his last-round game against GM [[Sebastian Siebrecht]]. Natsidis admitted that he had cheated, and was disqualified from the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/crosswords/chess/chess-christoph-natsidis-punished-for-cheating.html|title=Christoph Natsidis Punished for Cheating|last=McClain|first=Dylan|date=2011-06-12|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the 2012 Virginia Scholastic and Collegiate Championships, a player was caught using a chess engine running on a PDA.  The player was disqualified from the tournament, had his membership to the Virginia Chess Federation suspended, and had an ethics complaint filed to the USCF.  Unlike other incidents, the player was using the chess engine disguised as using eNotate, which is one of two electronic chess notation programs permitted to be used at USCF tournaments. While the player only admitted to using the chess engine in that one match, his results suggested he had been using the program for several tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The evolution of cheating in chess |url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8362701/the-evolution-cheating-chess | author=Dave McKenna| publisher=Grantland.com (ESPN) | date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the 2013 Cork Congress Chess Open, a 16-year-old player was found to be using a chess program on a smartphone when his opponent, Gabriel Mirza, confronted him in the toilets, kicking down the cubicle door and physically hauling him out. Mirza received a ten-month ban for bringing chess into disrepute for his violent conduct, while his opponent was only banned for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/teen-caught-in-chess-cheat-row-is-banned-30127759.html|title=Teen caught in chess cheat row is banned - Herald.ie|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local-news/good-news-for-limerick-chess-player-at-centre-of-cheat-row-1-5044989|title=Good news for Limerick chess player at centre of cheat row|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/chess-union-to-investigate-cheating-row-between-players-29220748.html|title=Chess union to investigate cheating row between players - Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2016, the blind Norwegian player Stein Bjørnsen was accused of cheating after playing games that showed a very high correlation with computer analysis. Due to his disability, Bjørnsen had been allowed to keep a record of his moves with a recorder coupled to an ear plug. The ear plug was later found to be incompatible with the recorder, but capable of receiving messages by [[Bluetooth]]. In April 2016 he received a two-year ban on domestic competition from the Central Board of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/sport/sjakk/blind-sjakkspiller-utestengt-for-juks/a/23667458/|title=Blind sjakkspiller utestengt for juks|last1=Aaserud|first1=Mikal|last2=Christiansen|first2=Anders K.|date=25 April 2016|work=Verdens Gang|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnsen's appeal to the federation's rules committee was turned down in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/sport/blind-sjakkspiller-utestenges-i-to-ar/62442079|title=Blind sjakkspiller utestenges i to år|last=Bryne|first=Lars|date=9 September 2016|publisher=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnson returned in 2018 after serving the ban. In March that year he was caught with a Bluetooth earpiece taped to his hand during a club tournament in [[Horten]]. The federation expelled Bjørnsen in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sb.no/sjakk/sandefjord/sport/jukset-mot-niaring-na-er-han-ekskludert-fra-sjakkforbundet/s/5-73-708255|title=Jukset mot niåring – nå er han ekskludert fra sjakkforbundet|last=Andreassen|first=Erik|date=24 May 2018|publisher=Sandefjords blad|language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating manipulation==

Since the introduction of [[Elo ratings]] in the 1960s, a number of attempts have been made to manipulate the rating system, either to deliberately inflate one's rating or to disguise one's strength by deliberately losing rating points.

===Sandbagging===
Sandbagging involves deliberately losing rated games in order to lower one's rating so that one is eligible to enter the lower rated section of a tournament with substantial prize money. This is most common in the United States, where the prize money for large open tournaments can be over $10,000, even in the lower rated sections. Sandbagging is very difficult to detect and prove, so [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] has included minimum ratings based on previous ratings or money winnings to minimize the effect.

===Small pools of players===
A limited pool of players who rarely or never play against players from outside of that pool can cause distortions in the Elo rating system, especially if one or more of the players is significantly stronger than the others, or if the results are deliberately manipulated.

[[Claude Bloodgood]] was accused of manipulating the [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] rating system in this way; at his peak in 1996 his USCF rating was in excess of 2700, the second highest in the country at the time. As a long-term prison inmate, he was necessarily restricted in the range of opponents available to him. The USCF suspected that he had deliberately inflated the ratings of his opponents; Bloodgood denied this, attributing his inflated rating to a quirk in the rating system resulting from his regularly playing against a limited pool of much weaker players.

There was widespread reporting of anomalous Burmese (Myanmar) rating movements in the late 1990s, with Milan Novkovic giving an analysis of manipulation in ''Schach'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweekinchess.com/html/twic226.html This Week in Chess 226, section 4 (originally in ''Schach'' magazine 3/99)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===False tournament reports===
The most notable international example of ratings manipulation involves Romanian [[Alexandru Crisan]], who allegedly falsified tournament reports to gain a Grandmaster title and was ranked 33rd in the world on the April 2001 [[FIDE]] rating list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ratings.fide.com/toparc.phtml?cod=13|title=Top 100 Players April 2001 FIDE Top players archive|first=|last=Administrator|website=ratings.fide.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee overseeing the matter recommended his rating be erased and his Grandmaster title revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/fidecrisan.html |title=FIDE Ruling on Alexandru Crisan (web archive) |date=2001-09-07 |accessdate=2007-06-14 |work=The Week in Chess Magazine |publisher=London Chess Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030317071540/http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/fidecrisan.html |archivedate=17 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Romanian Chess Federation initially favored action against Crisan, eventually he himself became the RCF president and changed the policy, creating such a situation that FIDE intervened to broker a resolution regarding many problems in the RCF, including Crisan's rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/minutes/annex_19.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=22 May 2004|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040522221850/http://www.fide.com/minutes/annex_19.pdf|archivedate=22 May 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crisan then was arrested and imprisoned on fraud charges relating to his management of the company Urex Rovinari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitorulexpres.ro/?mod=ultima_ora&amp;p=ultora_local&amp;s_id=106394|title=Alexandru Crişan, condamnat la patru ani de închisoare|first=|last=User|website=www.monitorulexpres.ro|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disappeared from chess,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/anatoly-karpov-speaks-his-mind|title=Anatoly Karpov speaks his mind|date=6 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus failing to fulfill the conditions of the resolution and so activating the above recommendations regarding title revocation. FIDE did not fully update its online information until August 2015, when all his titles were removed and his rating adjusted downwards to 2132.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml ''FIDE rating list archive''], download and compare Crisan's rating between the July 2015 and August 2015 (FIDE ID 1201271)&lt;/ref&gt; When writing about the Crisan case, Ian Rogers alleges that Andrei Makarov (at the time a FIDE vice-president and Russian chess federation president) had arranged an IM title for himself through nonexistent tournaments in 1994.&lt;ref name="rogers"/&gt;

Rumors of rigged tournaments are not unheard of in the chess world. For instance, in 2005, FIDE refused to ratify norms from the Alushta (Ukraine) tournaments, claiming that the games did not meet ethical expectations. A number of players involved protested over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/dear-kirsan-nikolayevich-alushta-is-for-real-/708|title=Dear Kirsan Nikolayevich, Alushta is for real!|date=24 July 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A different Ukrainian tournament in 2005 was found to be completely fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-fake-heroes-of-chernobyl|title=The fake Heroes of Chernobyl|date=3 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nigel_short"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-fake-heroes-of-chernobyl-revisited|title=The fake Heroes of Chernobyl revisited|date=23 May 2005|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the strongest players are not involved in these, as they are more for careerist players to gain title norms or small rating gains, but [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] was alleged to have rigged the results of the Strumica tournament of 1995 to allow him to reach the chess elite.&lt;ref name="rogers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auschess.org.au/columns/ct/ct160901.htm|title=Chess Column|website=www.auschess.org.au|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nigel_short"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/19535|title=Evgeny Sveshnikov: "Only fools learn from their mistakes. It seems I am one of them..." - chess-news.ru|website=chess-news.ru|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strumica 1995, Azmai's Answer ''New in Chess'' 1996/3, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Sveshnikov referred to these high-profile Crisan and Azmaiparashvili incidents as "open secrets", at a time when both purported culprits were heavily involved in FIDE politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmsquare.com/sveshnikovFIDE.html|title=GrandMaster Square &gt;&gt;&gt; Letter from GM Sveshnikov|website=www.gmsquare.com|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simultaneous games==
A player with no knowledge of chess can achieve a 50% score in [[simultaneous chess]] by replicating the moves made by one of his white opponents in a match against a black opponent, and vice versa; the opponents in effect play each other rather than the giver of the simul. This may be considered cheating in some events such as [[Basque chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/che-magazine-basque-che-does-it-work-for-you-|title=CHESS Magazine: Basque Chess – does it work for you?!|date=29 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used against any even number of opponents.  [[Stage magician]] [[Derren Brown]] used the trick against eight leading British chess players in his television show.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''combat sport''', or '''fighting sport''', is a competitive [[contact sport]] that usually involves one-on-one combat. In many combat sports, a contestant wins by scoring more points than the opponent or by disabling the opponent. Common combat sports include [[Mixed Martial Arts|mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[fencing]], [[savate]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Sanda (Sport)|Sanda]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[Capoeira]], [[Brazilian Jiu-jitsu]], [[Historical medieval battles|HMB]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], [[Kyokushin]], and [[Kūdō]].

== History ==
{{further information|History of martial arts}}
[[Folk wrestling|Tradition styles of wrestling]] exist in most cultures; [[wrestling]] can be considered a [[cultural universal]]. [[Boxing]] contests date back to ancient [[Sumer]] in the 3rd millennium BCE and [[ancient Egypt]] ''circa'' 1350 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boxing|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/boxing|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=May 12, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Olympic Games]] included several combat-related sports: [[Hoplitodromos|armored foot races]], boxing, wrestling, and [[pankration]], which was introduced in the [[Olympic Games]] of 648 BCE.

In [[ancient China]], combat sport appeared in the form of [[lei tai]]. It was a no-holds barred combat sport that combined boxing and wrestling. There is evidence of similar combat sports in ancient Egypt, [[History of India|India]] and [[History of Japan|Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownell|first=Susan Elaine|title=The olympic movement on its way into Chinese culture|date=1990|publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]|pages=29, 63|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ita1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=ancient+leitai|language=en|quote=In both ancient China and Greece, the most popular sports were probably wrestling, boxing, and combinations thereof (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai). The same might be argued for ancient Egypt, India and Japan. [...] In both ancient China and Greece, the no-holds-barred combat sport (Greek pankration, Chinese leitai) was probably the most popular one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the [[Middle ages]] and [[Renaissance]], the [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] was popular. Tournaments were competitions that featured several mock combat events, with [[jousting]] as a main event. While the tournament was popular among [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s, combat sports were practiced by all levels of society. The [[German school of fencing|German school]] of late medieval martial arts distinguished sportive combat (''schimpf'') from serious combat (''ernst''). In the [[German Renaissance]], sportive combat competitions were known as [[Fechtschule]]n, corresponding to the [[Prize Playing]] in [[Tudor England]]. Out of these Prize Playing events developed the English [[boxing]] (or ''prizefighting'') of the 18th century, which evolved into modern boxing with the introduction of the [[Marquess of Queensberry rules]] in 1867.

[[Amateur boxing]] has been part of the modern Olympic Games since their introduction in 1904. [[Professional boxing]] became popular in the United States [[Boxing in the 1920s|in the 1920s]] and experienced a "golden age" [[Boxing in the 1950s|after World War II]].

The creation of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] is attributed to the [[Gracie family|Gracie]] family of Brazil in 1925 after Asian martial arts were introduced to Brazil. [[Vale-tudo]], wrestling, [[muay thai]] kickboxing and luta livre gained popularity.
Modern [[Muay Thai]] was developed in the 1920s to 1930s. [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] was introduced in the [[Soviet Union]]. Modern [[Taekwondo]] also emerged after the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] and became an Olympic sport in 2000. [[Sanshou]] as part of [[Wushu (sport)|modern wushu]] was developed in the [[People's Republic of China]] since the 1950s. [[Kickboxing]] and [[full contact karate]] were developed in the 1960s and became popular in Japan and the West during the 1980s and 1990s. Modern [[Mixed Martial Arts]] developed out of the interconnected subcultures of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] and [[shoot wrestling]]. It was introduced in Japan in the form of [[Shooto]] in 1985, and in the United States as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) in 1993. The [[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]] were introduced in 2000, and the sport experienced peak popularity in the 2000s. During this period, multiple brands and promotions were established. The most well-known promotion for MMA is UFC.

[[File:José Aldo vs. Conor McGregor, UFC 189 World Tour London.jpg|thumb|363x363px|A photo of Conor McGregor, Jose Aldo, and Dana White at a press conference for the fight between McGregor and Aldo. This shows the two fighters posing for media, increasing revenue and interest in the fight.]]

== Popularity of combat sports by gender ==
Combat sports are generally more popular among men, both as athletes and as spectators. For many years, participation in combat sports was practically exclusive to men; [[USA Boxing]] had a ban on women's boxing until 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Boxing/About-Us/History-of-Amateur-Boxing.aspx|title=History of Amateur Boxing|work=Team USA|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study conducted by Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons and Thorn in 2015 revealed that combat sports had a largely male audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwell, Hancock, Simmons, Thorn|year=2015|title=The effects of gender and social roles on the marketing of combat sport.|journal=Sport Marketing Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|page=19|issn=1061-6934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat sport promotions such as UFC or [[Bellator MMA]] are generally advertised to men.

== Modern sports ==
Combat [[Sportsperson|athletes]] usually [[fight]] one-on-one. Different sports involve different skill sets and moves. For example, [[boxing]] only allows [[Punch (strike)|punches]], [[taekwondo]] largely involves [[kick]]s, and both [[muay thai|Muay Thai]] and [[Burmese boxing]] allow the use of [[Elbow (strike)|elbows]] and [[Knee (strike)|knees]]. There are also combat sports based on [[grappling]], such as both [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Collegiate wrestling]]. Modern [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] is similar to the ancient Greek Olympic sport of [[pankration]]; Both allow a wide range of both [[strike (attack)|striking]] and grappling techniques.

Some combat sports involve the use of [[weapons]] and armor, such as [[fencing]], [[kendo]], and the new sport [[SCA Heavy Combat]]; In [[Gatka]] and [[Modern Arnis]], sticks are used.

The techniques used can be categorized into three domains: [[Strike (attack)|striking]], [[grappling]], and [[martial arts weapon|weapon usage]], with some [[hybrid martial arts|hybrid]] rule-sets combining striking and grappling. In combat sports the use of these various techniques are highly regulated to minimize permanent or severe physical damage to each participant though means of organized officiating by a single or multiple referees that can distribute penalties or interrupt the actions of the competitors during the competition. In weapon based sports, the weapons used are made to be non-lethal by means of modifying the striking portions of the weapon and requiring participants to wear protective clothing/armor.

== Olympic Combat Sports ==
* [[Amateur boxing]] - (1904 - 2016). Boxing has been staged at every summer Olympic games since 1904 except Stockholm in 1912 due to Swedish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Judo]] - (1964, 1972 - 2016). Judo was not included in the 1968 Mexico City summer Olympics. Women's judo was added to the Olympics in 1992 in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/judo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Judo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Taekwondo]] - 1988 Seoul Games (demonstration sport), 2000 - 2016. Became an official medal sport at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wrestling ([[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]]) - (1908 - 2016). The first form of wrestling to be held at the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-greco-roman-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Greco Roman Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wrestling ([[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]]) - (1920 - 2016). Was modified at the 2000 Sydney Games and reduced the amount of weight categories provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/wrestling-freestyle-equipment-and-history?tab=history|title=Wrestling Freestyle Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pankration]] and [[singlestick]] are two other forms of combat sports that have been included in the olympics. These combat sports were introduced to the Olympic Games in the early 1900s however singlestick was only represented at the 1904 Olympic games and pankration whilst lasting four centuries in Ancient Greek Olympia's, was not included at all after 1900.
* [[Fencing]] - (1896 - 2016) Competitive fencing is one of the five activities which have been featured in every modern Olympic Games, the other four being athletics, cycling, swimming, and gymnastics.

== Protective Gear/Clothing ==
In combat sports, victory is obtained from blows, punches or attacks to the head to a point of physical injury that the opponent is unable to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ama.com.au/position-statement/combat-sport-2015|title=Combat Sport - 2015|date=2015-11-21|website=Australian Medical Association|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of combat sport have different rules and regulations into the equipment competitors have to wear. In Amateur boxing seen at the Olympics, competitors are permitted to wear head guards and correctly weighted padded gloves, mouth guards are optional and the canvas floor protection from a hard fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/boxing-equipment-and-history|title=Boxing Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sports such as Taekwondo, competitors are permitted to wear a trunk protector, head guard, gloves, groin guard and shin and forearm pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/taekwondo-equipment-and-history|title=Taekwondo Equipment, History and Rules {{!}} Olympic.org|website=www.olympic.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional boxing and UFC are two of the most dangerous combat sports in the world due to the lack of protective gear worn. Competitors in these two sports have the option to wear a mouthguard and must wear suitable gloves. The lack of protective clothing makes competitors vulnerable to concussion and further traumatic head injuries. A scientific experiment, conducted last year by Dr Andrew McIntosh of ACRISP at the Federation University of Australia, tested the impact of 7 different head guards in combat sport. The results of the experiment revealed the benefits of the combination of a glove and headguard in maximising the impact energy attenuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/17/1113.full|title=Sign In|publisher=|pmid=26192195}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Lystad showed that combat sports with little to no protective gear such as MMA or boxing has an injury incidence rate range of 85.1-280.7 per 1000 athletes in comparison to another striking combat sport like Taekwondo which has a large amount of protective gear such as pads, headgear, mouth guard and gloves, has an injury incidence rate range of 19.1-138.8 per 1000 athletes. This means that injury rates are drastically lowered when protective gear is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lystad|first=Reidar|year=2015|title=Epidemiology of injuries in full-contact combat sports|journal=Australasian Epidemiologist|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::A circle which is 27 feet in diameter, of which the inner 24 feet is colored blue. The next 3 feet is yellow, which is the caution area. When the fighter gets to the yellow area, he knows he's getting close to stepping out-of-bounds. The last edge of the ring is the red zone, which features a 30-degree upward angle. When a fighter steps on the red area, he's stepping up slightly, letting him know he's out-of-bounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9696">'''Computer science in sport''' is an interdisciplinary discipline that has its goal in combining the theoretical as well as practical aspects and methods of the areas of [[Information technology|informatics]] and [[sport science]]. The main emphasis of the [[interdisciplinarity]] is placed on the application and use of computer-based but also mathematical techniques in sport science, aiming in this way at the support and advancement of theory and practice in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Link |first1=D. |last2=Lames |first2=M. |title=Sport Informatics - Historical Roots, Interdisciplinarity and Future Developments |journal=International Journal of Computer Science in Sport |date=2009 |volume=Volume 8 |issue=Edition 2 |pages=68-87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why [[computer science]] has become an important partner for sport science is mainly connected with "the fact that the use of data and media, the design of models, the analysis of systems etc. increasingly requires the support of suitable tools and concepts which are developed and available in computer science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnold Baca |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part I) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 25-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
Going back in history, computers in sports were used for the first time in the 1960s, when the main purpose was to accumulate sports information. [[Database]]s were created and expanded in order to launch documentation and dissemination of publications like articles or books that contain any kind of knowledge related to sports science. Until the mid-1970s also the first organization in this area called IASI (International Association for Sports Information) was formally established. Congresses and meetings were organized more often with the aim of standardization and rationalization of sports documentation. Since at that time this area was obviously less computer-oriented, specialists talk about sports information rather than sports informatics when mentioning the beginning of this field of science.

Based on the progress of computer science and the invention of more powerful computer hardware in the 1970s, also the real history of computer science in sport began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jürgen Perl |title=Computer science in sport: an overview of history, present fields and future applications (part II) |year=2006}} IJCSS Special Edition 2/2006, 36-46.&lt;/ref&gt; This was as well the first time when this term was officially used and the initiation of a very important evolution in sports science.

In the early stages of this area statistics on biomechanical data, like different kinds of forces or rates, played a major role. Scientists started to analyze sports games by collecting and looking at such values and features in order to interpret them. Later on, with the continuous improvement of computer hardware - in particular microprocessor speed – many new scientific and computing paradigms were introduced, which were also integrated in computer science in sport. Specific examples are [[Computer model|modeling]] as well as [[simulation]], but also [[pattern recognition]], design, and (sports) [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bahadorreza Ofoghi |author2=John Zeleznikow |author3=Clare MacMahon |author4=Markus Raab |title=Data mining in elite sports: A review and a framework |year=2013 |journal=Measurement in Physical Education and Exercise Science | volume=17 | issue=3 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1091367X.2013.805137#.VI-ipE103Dc |doi=10.1080/1091367X.2013.805137 |pages=171–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Iztok Fister Jr. |author2=Karin Ljubič |author3=Ponnuthrai Nagaratnam Suganthan |author4=Matjaž Perc |author5=Iztok Fister |title=Computational intelligence in sports: Challenges and opportunities within a new research domain |year=2015 |journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation | volume=262 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300315004300 |doi=10.1016/j.amc.2015.04.004 |pages=178–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As another result of this development, the term 'computer science in sport' has been added in the encyclopedia of sports science in 2004.

== Areas of research ==
The importance and strong influence of computer science as an interdisciplinary partner for sport and sport science is mainly proven by the research activities in computer science in sport. The following IT concepts are thereby of particular interest:

* [[Data acquisition]] and [[data processing]]
* Databases and [[expert system]]s
* Modelling (mathematical, IT based, biomechanical, physiological)
* Simulation (interactive, animation etc.)
* Presentation

Based on the fields from above, the main areas of research in computer science in sport include amongst others:

* [[Training]] and coaching
* [[Biomechanics]]
* [[Sports equipment]] and technology
* Computer-aided applications (software, hardware) in sports
* [[Ubiquitous computing]] in sports
* [[Multimedia]] and [[Internet]]
* Documentation
* Education

== Research communities ==
A clear demonstration for the evolution and propagation towards computer science in sport is also the fact that nowadays people do research in this area all over the world. Since the 1990s many new national and international organizations regarding the topic of computer science in sport were established. These associations are regularly organizing congresses and workshops with the aim of dissemination as well as exchange of scientific knowledge and information on all sort of topics regarding the interdisciplinary discipline.

=== Historical survey ===
As a first example, in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] scientists have built up the MathSport group of [[ANZIAM]] (Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics), which since 1992 organizes biennial meetings, initially under the name "Mathematics and Computers in Sport Conferences", and now "[[MathSport]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anziam.org.au/MathSport MathSport], www.anziam.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; Main topics are mathematical models and computer applications in sports, as well as coaching and teaching methods based on informatics.

The European community was also among the leading motors of the emergence of the field. Some workshops on this topic were successfully organized in Germany since the late 1980s. In 1997 the first international meeting on computer science in sport was held in Cologne. The main aim was to spread out and share applications, ideas and concepts of the use of computers in sports, which should also make a contribution to the creation of internationalization and thus to boost research work in this area.

Since then, such international symposia took place every two years all over Europe. As the first conferences were a raving success, it was decided to go even further and the foundation of an organization was the logical consequence. This step was accomplished in 2003, when the International Association of Computer Science in Sport (IACSS) was established during the 4th international symposium in Barcelona, when Prof. Jürgen Perl was also chosen as the first president. A few years earlier, the first international e-journal on this topic (International Journal of Computer Science in Sport) was released already. The internationalization is confirmed moreover by the fact that three conferences already took place outside of Europe - in [[Calgary]] ([[Canada]]) in 2007, [[Canberra]] ([[Australia]]) in 2009 and [[Shanghai]] ([[China]]) in 2011. During the symposium in Calgary additionally the president position changed - it has been assigned to Prof. Arnold Baca, who has been re-elected in 2009 and 2011. The following Symposia on Computer Science in Sport took place in Europe again, in [[Istanbul]] ([[Turkey]]) in 2013 and in [[Loughborough]] ([[UK]]) in 2015. In 2017 the 11th Symposium of Computer Science in Sport took place in [[Constance]] ([[Germany]]). During the conference in Istanbul Prof. Martin Lames was elected as president of the IACSS. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2017.

=== National organizations ===
In addition to the international associations from above, currently the following national associations on computer science in sport exist (if available, the web addresses are also given):

* Austrian Association of Computer Science in Sport - http://www.sportinformatik.at
* British Association of Computer Science in Sport and Exercise

The '''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe''' was an international aeronautical speed competition instituted on 25 August 1909 by the French oil magnate [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]]. The race was reinstated three times through the years at the initiative of the [[Aéro-Club de France]], and later by  Deutsch de la Meurthe's widow Suzanne.

==First Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
Announced in 1906, the first Deutsch de la Meurthe competition was a speed trial intended for all powered aircraft over a distance of 200 kilometres, to be flown as an outward leg of 100 km followed by a return to the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551284g/f7.image.r=Deutsch%20de%20la%20Meurthe Bulletin Officiel de l'Aėro-Club de France] [[l'Aėrophile]], March 1906, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The flight had to be made between  1 March and  31 October, and the performance was recognized only if the previous best performance was surpassed by at least 10%. A bonus of 20,000 [[French franc|francs]] was awarded each year for the best performance that had remained unsurpassed for eight months. The Coupe (cup), an objet d'art valued at 10,000 francs, was to be given to the first aircraft builder who won three consecutive competitions.&lt;ref name=flight1919&gt;{{cite |journal=Flight |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201366.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de l a Meurthe |volume=XI |number=564|date=16 October 1919 |page= 1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===1912 competition===
Despite the substantial prize being offered, it took six years to attract participants. On 12 April 1912, [[Maurice Tabuteau]] piloting a 50&amp;nbsp;hp [[Gnome et Rhône|Gnome]]-powered [[Morane-Saulnier]] monoplane flew the circuit in 1 h 47 min 48 s, despite persistent navigation problems caused by fog. On 1 May 1912 Parisian Emmanuel Hélen completed the course at {{convert|119.532|kph|mph|abbr=on}} flying a 70&amp;nbsp;hp Gnome-powered [[Nieuport]] monoplane. Since no other pilot bettered this performance by more than 10% before 31 October 1912, Hélen became the first holder of the Coupe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200317.html Flight, 5 May 1921, p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1913 competition===
On 27 October 1913 [[Eugène Gilbert]] gained first place in the second competition for the Coupe, covering the course at an average speed of {{convert|154.38|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in a 160 h.p. Gnome-powered [[Deperdussin Monocoque]].

===1919/1920 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage 29V racer.jpg|thumb|Nieuport-Delage NiD.29V racer]]
The competition was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]], but on 13 October 1919 it resumed using the same course, but the competition was now open for the entire year, and the trophy would be definitely kept by the first participant whose time remained unbeaten for eight consecutive months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201390.html Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'' 23 October 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Four aeroplanes participated in this trial: a 180&amp;nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]]-powered [[Gourdou-Leseurre]] monoplane piloted by Rost, a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|SPAD]]-Herbemont piloted by [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]], a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Nieuport biplane piloted by [[Bernard Barny de Romanet]], and a 180&amp;nbsp;hp Le Rhöne-powered Nieuport monoplane designed by engineer Mary, and flown by the Danish pilot [[Leth Jensen]]. Taking off on 13 October 1919, Jensen flew the circuit at an average speed of 200.001&amp;nbsp;km/h (57 minutes). The next day, Rost reached an average speed of 210&amp;nbsp;km/h while de Romanet had an aircraft failure. On 15 October, Sadi-Lecointe flew a first circuit at 223&amp;nbsp;km/h, and then a second lap at 246.9&amp;nbsp;km/h and thus became the title holder. On 21 October 1919, de Romanet reached an average speed of 268.631&amp;nbsp;km/h which was insufficient to be homologated, because this performance was less than 110% of Sadi-Lecointe's performance. He followed it the next day with an average speed of 285.600 km/h which did count. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201420.html "The Coupe Deutsch"] ''Flight'' 30 October 1919 p1422&lt;/ref&gt; Bad weather then stopped the competition, which was resumed just three months later. On 3 January 1920, Sadi-Lecointe, who had in the meanwhile had left [[Blériot-SPAD]] for Nieuport, reached {{convert|266.314|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;"The Deutsch Cup Contest" ''Flight'' 8 January 1920 p56&lt;/ref&gt;  with a Hispano-engined [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29]]V. On 3 August 1920, he became the holder of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, his performance having remained unbeaten.

==Second Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1920, following the ending of the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Trophy]] competition due to a third consecutive French victory, the Aéro-Club de France decided to organize a new competition to replace it. This was named ''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe'' to honour [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]], who had died on 24 November 1919; the competition was funded by his family.

It remained a speed competition, but was now to be held on a given date. The competition was to be held as 3 laps of a 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) circuit, with its start at [[Étampes]] and a turn made at la Marmogne farm at [[Gidy]]. The competition was open for three years and was international, with each country allowed three entrants. A sum of 60,000 francs was to be awarded each year for the best performance, and a cup valued at 20,000 francs given to the winner. In the case of the cup being won outright before the end of the competition, the winner would also received the remaining prize money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200327.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal=Flight |date=12 May 1921 |page=327 |format=pdf |number=645 |volume=XIII)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan.jpg|thumb|Nieuport NiD.41 Sesquiplan]]
There were seven participants in this race, which was held on 1 October. No eliminating heats were needed to select from the five French pilot entrants, since Count [[Bernard Barny de Romanet|Bernard de Romanet]] died when the wing fabric of his Lumière-De Monge monoplane&lt;ref group=note&gt;The aircraft could be configured as either a biplane or a monoplane.&lt;/ref&gt; detached at high speed during the elimination trials on 23 September, and at the last moment [[Hanriot (aircraft company)|Hanriot]] withdrew their entrant, the Hanriot HD.22. This was a metal monoplane with retractable landing gear expressly built for the race, and which had been intended to be piloted by Rost. Nieuport entered two [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29|Nieuport NiD.29V]]s  piloted by Sadi-Lecointe and Ferdinand Lasne, and a [[Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan|NiD.41 Sesquiplan]] was entrusted to Georges Kirsch. A 700&amp;nbsp;hp Fiat-powered [[Fiat Aviazione|Fiat]] biplane piloted by [[Francesco Brack Papa]] represented Italy, and British pilot Herbert James flew a 450&amp;nbsp;hp [[Napier Lion]]-powered [[Nieuport Nighthawk|Gloster Mars I]] (G-EAXZ).&lt;ref name=flight1921&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200650.html The Coupe de Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'', 29 September 1921, pp. 650-651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;
A broken propeller forced Sadi-Lecointe to make a forced landing in a beet field at Cernonville, injuring an eye and both legs in the process. The wing fabric of James' aeroplane was torn away, and he had to make a forced landing. Brach Papa established a new Italian speed record, but the engine exploded before the finish. Thus, only two Nieuport pilots were left to finish the race, Georges Kirsch winning with a speed of 282.75&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new world speed record for a distance of 300&amp;nbsp;km); Fernand Lasne's speed was 259.03&amp;nbsp;km/h.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

===1922 competition===
The 1921 circuit remained unchanged for the 1922 competition, which was held on 30 September. Nieuport-Astra&lt;ref group=note&gt;Nieuport having taken over the [[Société Astra]] by this point&lt;/ref&gt; entered a Nieuport NiD.29V piloted by Lasne and the sesquiplane piloted by Sadi-Lecointe, [[Jean Casale]] was piloting a Blériot-SPAD S.58, a design based on the [[Blériot-SPAD S.41|S.41 fighter]]. Fiat and Gloster were presenting the same machines and pilots as the preceding year. Assigned to their factory pilot Berthelin, who was new to this competition, the NiD.41 was retired at the last moment. The [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] Simplex aircraft which was supposed to be piloted by [[Georges Madon]] had an accident during its tests, and [[Charles Nungesser]] was absent.&lt;ref name=flight1922&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200573.html |title=The race for the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal= Flight |date=5 October 1922 |pages=573-576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Nieuport sesquiplane named ''Eugène Gilbert'' (race number 5), Sadi-Lecointe covered the first 100&amp;nbsp;km at an average speed of 325&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new closed circuit speed record), but a spark plug popped out of its cylinder and passed through the engine cowling as he was turning around the airport pylon. The pilot was therefore forced to land, and the airplane hit a gutter which turned the aircraft on its back without injuring the pilot. James lost his maps during his flight and unable to find the turning point returned to the start. Jean Casale's SPAD S.58 ''Louis Blériot'' (race no.3) was victim of a radiator leak, and made a forced landing at Étampes and was unable to finish the race, as was also the case for Brack-Papa's [[Fiat B.R.|Fiat R.700]] which had a fuel pump failure.{{cn|date=September 2015}} The first lap made by the Italian pilot at 288&amp;nbsp;km/h (179&amp;nbsp;mph) was not homologated since the aircraft had flown behind the time-keepers at the starting point, but he was offered a second attempt. Brack-Papa started a second time but retired when he realized he would not be able to beat Lasne, ) who won the competition with an average speed of 289.90&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=flight1922/&gt;

==Third Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1931 Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe initiated a new competition for the Coupe, which was contested for the first time on 29 May 1933. The trial was to be run in two 1,000&amp;nbsp;km stages separated by a 90 minutes refuelling stop, and was limited to aircraft with an engine capacity of less than eight litres. The starting point of the race was still at Étampes. Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe was offering one million Francs, and the Ministère de l'Air (Air Ministry) offered another three million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200422.html Flight, 6 May 1932, p. 390]&lt;/ref&gt;
===1933 competition===
[[File:Potez 53 Musee du Bourget P1010709.JPG|thumb|A Potez 53]]
On 24 May 1933 Captain [[Ludovic Arrachart]] was killed when his [[Caudron C.362|Caudron C.360]] (race no.11) crashed due to engine failure at Maisons near [[Chartres]] while he was training for the competition.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65535525/f6.image.r=caudron|date=June 1933|page=166|title=La Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was won by Georges Détré flying a [[Potez 53]] powered by a Potez 9B radial engine developing barely 310&amp;nbsp;hp at full power at a speed of {{convert|322.81|kph|mph}},  beating Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 (race no.6) with a speed of {{convert|291.12|kph|mph}}, and also beating the only foreign competitor, [[Nick Comper]] flying [[Comper Swift]] ''G-ABWW'' {{convert|239.58|kph|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; A third French competitor, test pilot Lemoine also flying a Potez 53, was forced to abandon the race.&lt;ref name=flight1934-510&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200510.html Flight, 24 May 1934, pp. 510-511]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 competition===
[[File:Caudron 460 Le Bourget 2009.jpg|thumb|A Caudron C.460 replica]]
[[File:GMars.jpg|thumb|Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ)]]
On 27 May 1934, the race was a duel between the Caudron pilots, the [[Caudron]] firm presenting two racing aircraft designed by [[Marcel Riffard]]. [[Maurice Arnoux]] won with a C.450 at a speed of 388.97&amp;nbsp;km/h overtaking Louis Massotte's [[Régnier Motor Company|Regnier]]-engined (and sponsored) C.366 (360.72&amp;nbsp;km/h) and Albert Monville's Renault-engined [[Caudron C.460]] (341.04&amp;nbsp;km/h). Nick Comper flew the [[Comper Streak]] (G-ACNC), but retired on the 6th lap of the afternoon session as problem with the undercarriage limited his speed. Georges Detre flying a [[Potez 53]]-2 retired after problems with his engine oil supply. The [[Potez 53]]-3 had problems with its variable pitch propeller and was unable to start for the second section,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flight1934-510/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1933/1933%20-%200976.html Flight, 9 Nov 1933, p. 976]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200480.html Flight, 17 May 1934, pp. 476, 480-481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200531.html Flight, 31 May 1934, pp. 531-532]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 competition===
The 1935 race was arguably the most exciting{{cn|date=September 2015}} competition of them all, and was the consecration of the Caudron-Renault racers. Eight pilots were registered for this event, but the [[Nennig C-3]] (race no.4) of [[Guy Bart]] was not ready, and the Régnier Martinet, a modified Caudron C.366, (race no.2) was damaged during its tests. Two Caudron C.560s were supposed to participate (race no.1 and 3), but were not ready. They were thus replaced by a [[Caudron C.430]] and a C.450 with the same race numbers.&lt;ref name=flight1935&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1935/1935%20-%201324.html "A Family Affair"] ''Flight'', 30 May 1935, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;

The course was over 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;miles), from [[Etampes]] aerodrome to [[Chartres]] [[Boncé|Bonce]] and back. The race itself was in two stages, each of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (625&amp;nbsp;miles).

Charles Franco was the first to take off in Caudron C.430 (race no.1), but abandoned the race on the fourth lap as he was clearly out-classed by the other aircraft. It was followed by the Caudron C.460s of [[Yves Lacombe]] (race no.5), [[Raymond Delmotte]] (Caudron's chief pilot) (race no.8 ), and [[Maurice Arnoux]] (race no.6) respectively, this last entrant having to quit the race after seven laps, having run out of oil after a high-speed lap at {{convert|469|km/h|abbr=on}}. [[Albert Monville]]'s Caudron C.450 (race no.3) was the last to take off. Only three aircraft qualified for the second part of the race, which was held during rain showers. Raymond Delmotte won, ahead of Yves Lacombe and Maurice Arnoux, flying the aircraft previously flown by Albert Monville .&lt;ref name=flight1935/&gt;

==Fourth Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
On 13 September 1936, a last competition was organized, in which two [[Caudron C.461]]s, one Caudron C.450 and two [[Caudron C.560]]s took part. Yves Lacombe won this race with a speed of only {{convert|389.462|km/h|abbr=on}}, overtaking Maurice Arnoux timed at {{convert|369.59|km/h|abbr=on}}, a performance barely superior to what had been established in 1934, probably because of bad engine tuning in a competition presenting no real challenge for the engine and aircraft manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202782.html ''Flight'', 15 October 1936, p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source does not mention anything save Lacombe won|date=September 2015}}

'''Grishko Ltd.''' ({{lang-ru|Гришко}}) is a privately held manufacturer of dance shoes, wear and accessories. The company was founded in 1989 by Nikolai Grishko in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. It is an international company with four factories in Europe and sales in over 70 countries.&lt;ref name="hidden champions"/&gt; The company began as a [[:Category:Pointe shoe manufacturers|pointe shoe manufacturer]] and now produces many types of dance shoes and wear.&lt;ref name="organizational dynamics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarthy|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Puffer|first2=Sheila M.|last3=Vikhanski|first3=Oleg S.|last4=Naumov|first4=Alexander I.|title=Russian Managers in the New Europe: Need for a New Management Style|journal=Organizational Dynamics|date=2005|volume=34|page=235|url=http://www.cesruc.org/uploads/soft/130221/1-130221130339.pdf#search=grishko|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Nikolai decided to start the Grishko company after hearing dancers complain about their footwear through his wife, a former [[ballerina]].&lt;ref name=moscowtimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian Ballet Shoes Leave Their Footprint in the West|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-ballet-shoes-leave-their-footprint-in-the-west/446389.html#ixzz1ceRh7mhb|accessdate=12 January 2015|agency=The Moscow Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passport magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=Busy Hands|url=http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/1446/|accessdate=9 January 2015|publisher=Passport Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after starting the company in the early 1990s, many of the theatre workshops in Russia were forced to close and Nikolai recruited the master craftsmen from these theatre workshops to work with him.&lt;ref name="passport magazine" /&gt;  Nikolai also recruited the only person to date to have a PhD in ballet shoe technology and mechanics.&lt;ref name="hidden champions"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKiernan|first1=Peter|last2=Purg|first2=Danica|title=Hidden Champions in CEE and Turkey: Carving Out a Global Niche|isbn=978-3-642-40503-7|pages=292–295|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=PGi4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292&amp;lpg=PA292&amp;dq=grishko+company&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1eJdGaXYbL&amp;sig=wf_e9M17nKEX6rfpV0O94p8T19k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=syKZVOfNF8T-ywOmgYHYCg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=grishko%20company&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the company consists of four factories in Europe, a flagship store in Moscow Russia and over 500 employees, including 76 people with registered disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hromova |first=Anna |date=8 April 2008 |title=Встать на пуанты |trans-title=Literally on Your Toes |url=http://www.rg.ru/2008/04/08/puanty.html |language=Russian |agency=Российская газета |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''isometric exercise tool''' is a device used to exercise most body parts including the [[wrist]] and is often used as part of [[physical therapy]] or in order to build muscle strength in a low impact manner. Devices can range in size from large bulky machines used by physicians to small hand-held devices that can be used by an individual. Isometric devices have been used for centuries. The first devices did not display the users' output; nowadays there are devices that can digitally output the users force. Before that some devices used an analog format.

==How it works==
Isometric exercise tools perform exercises or strength test using static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term "isometric" combines the prefix "iso" (same) with "metric" (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/isometric-exercises.html Article on static strength training]&lt;/ref&gt;  as compared to ''isotonic contractions'' ("tonos" means "tension" in Greek) in which the contraction strength does not change but the joint angle does. New isometric exercise tools often used force gauges and a micro processor and then output the force onto an LCD screen or store the information later to be downloaded onto a computer.

==Medical uses==
Isometric exercises can also be used at the bedside to differentiate various [[heart murmur]]s; the murmur of [[mitral regurgitation]] gets louder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pediatrics.uchicago.edu/chiefs/ClinicCurriculum/documents/WCEvaluationofMurmursintheClinicSetting.pdf | title = Evaluation of Cardiac Murmurs in the Clinic Setting | publisher = University of Chicago | accessdate = 2008-01-10 | last = Ching | first = W }}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the quieter murmur of [[aortic stenosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy J, Aronow WS, Prakash R |title=The effect of isometric exercise on the systolic murmur of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis |journal=Chest |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |year=1975 |pmid=1168115 |doi=10.1378/chest.67.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with dynamic exercises==
Isometric exercises have some differences in training effect as compared to dynamic exercises. While isometric training increases strength at the specific joint angles of the exercises performed and additional joint angles to a lesser extent, dynamic exercises increase strength throughout the full [[range of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindh M |title=Increase of muscle strength from isometric quadriceps exercises at different knee angles |journal=Scand J Rehabil Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=33–6 |year=1979 |pmid=419396 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking however, people who train isometrically don't train through a full range of motion as the strength gained at the training joint angle is where they require it. While dynamic exercises are slightly better than isometric exercises at enhancing the twitch force of a muscle, isometrics are significantly better than dynamic exercises at increasing maximal strength at the joint angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duchateau J, Hainaut K |title=Isometric or dynamic training: differential effects on mechanical properties of a human muscle |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=296–301 |year=1984 |pmid=6706740 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flexibility may be increased when isometrics are performed at joint range of motion extremes.  These isometric contractions recruit muscle fibers that are often neglected in some dynamic exercises.  For example, gymnasts are extremely strong at great ranges of motion through the practice of isometric holds.

It is competed for by senior teams from the [[North of Scotland]] district. It is one of the five trophies considered to be part of the [[Grand Slam (shinty)|Grand Slam]] in the sport of shinty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/shinty-irrepressible-ross-scores-four-as-kingussie-clinch-macaulay-cup-1-822227 |title=Shinty: Irrepressible Ross scores four as Kingussie clinch Macaulay Cup |first=Kenneth |last=Steven |work=The Scotsman |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current holders are Newtonmore.

==History==
The trophy is a rose bowl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garthbeg.com/forum/showthread.php?t%3D16 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829004052/http://www.garthbeg.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16 |archivedate=2016-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by Duncan MacTavish of [[Stratherrick]] in 1898 and the first competition was played that year and was won by [[Skye Camanachd]].

The final was televised for the first time in 2009 by BBC Alba.  The 2009 winners were [[Newtonmore Camanachd Club|Newtonmore Camanachd]], managed by [[Norman MacArthur]].

As of 2010, the opening rounds of the cup were to be played midweek, in order to reduce the backlog of fixtures that has regularly afflicted shinty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyecamanachd.com/default.aspx.locid-087new1e7.Lang-EN.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  This caused major controversy and [[Skye Camanachd]] sent an official letter of complaint to the Camanachd Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1553579?UserKey=]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this decision was reversed and midweek fixtures were reserved for junior level cups.

The 2010 final was played between Kingussie and Kilmallie, who upset Fort William to reach the final. The game was a magnificent advert for shinty and was won 5-4 by Kingussie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/8749618.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; It was broadcast live on [[BBC 2 Scotland]].

In 2014, the MacTavish Plate was established for teams losing in the first round. Fort William triumphed 2-1 over [[Skye Camanachd]] in the first final at Craigard, Invergarry. 

Only 5 clubs have managed to retain the trophy. Newtonmore being the most recent in 2016 and 2017, however Kingussie and Newtonmore have both done it multiple times both dominating for long periods. Fort Augustus and Inverness have both also successfully defended the trophy both doing so before The Great War.

Glenurquhart won the cup in 2015, defeating Newtonmore. This was notable not only for being their first victory in the competition but having lost the previous two finals to Lovat, as well as the 2008 final to Kingussie.

The 2018 final saw Newtonmore comeback from a goal down to defeat 2017 Premiership League champions Kinlochshiel 2-1 in a closely fought encounter at the Bught Park, Inverness. The match was shown live on BBC Alba.

'''Misogyny in sports''' refers to different discourses, actions and [[ideologies]] present in various sporting environments that add, reinforce, or normalize the [[objectification]], degrading, [[shaming]], or absence of women. It can range from limiting women's participation to informal reinforcement of the men's status, by comparing it to that of a woman.  Misogyny within sports can also include unfair wages, as well as reduced coverage in sports media.  Because sports are so popular in today's society, they can be seen as a microcosm for the way people view their culture.

== Misogyny ==
Traditionally, the views of women's involvement in sports has led many to believe that they are absent from inclusion altogether. For much of history, most of the discussion around women and sports was centered around health risks for upper-class, white women, while excluding those of non-white or homosexual orientation.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;Daniels, Dayna B. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/film_and_history/v035/35.1daniels.html You Throw Like a Girl: Sport and Misogyny on the Silver Screen] Film &amp; History (2005): n. pag. Web. 2 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, female athletes receive an average of 63,000 fewer opportunities than men at [[NCAA]] institutions.&lt;ref name="Women's Sports Foundation 2013"&gt;"Women's Sports Foundation." Women's Sports Foundation. Women's Sports Foundation, 18 March 2013. Web. 12 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's participation in various sports, such as [[boxing]] or [[rugby union]], has grown in recent years. However, there is still an undertone that they don't belong, by calling into question their sexuality or [[femininity]].&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt; A 1993 study conducted by [[Michael Messner]] found that women were described using words like "girls" and "young women", while men were described using words like "young man" and "men" but never as "boys." The same study found also found instances of women's successes and failures being described as "her little jump hook", adding to the notion that women are less talented or skilled than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael. "Reflections on Communication and Sport." Reflections on Communication and Sport. Sage Journals, 30 December 2012. Web. 12 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples of [[Athletes and domestic violence|domestic violence against women in various sports]] have highlighted the deeply rooted [[misogyny]] present in most sports. Similarly, the masculinity that is involved in many sporting activities allow men to assume that they have "the right to vent their anger on the bodies of women and to discriminate against women in a number of different ways, including sexualizing and marginalizing them" says Kath Woodward, Professor of Sociology at the Open University.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Kath. "Time to Stop Playing Nice about Misogyny in Sports." The Conversation. Arts and Humanities Research Center, 23 October 2014. Web. 4 May 2015. &lt;http://theconversation.com/time-to-stop-playing-nice-about-misogyny-in-sports-33047&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the messages that are delivered to male sports participants are about being tougher than your opponent, and the toughest one wins. The worst thing to be called or compared to in sports is a woman, and the quickest way to cut someone down. Coaches and pop culture constantly deliver messages that emphasize hyper-masculinity. However, all too often the societal frame of being a man is one that undermines women. These behaviors are seen as normal in the male-dominated sports world.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Kate. "RECENT EVENTS EXPOSE SEXISM IN SPORTS CULTURE." ESPN. ESPN Internet Ventures, 14 February 2013. Web. 6 May 2015. &lt;http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/8944124/espnw-recent-events-further-expose-underlying-sexism-sports-culture&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Howard. "Sports' Male Problem." ESPN. ESPN Internet Ventures, 18 April 2013. Web. 6 May 2015. &lt;http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9183580/sports-male-problem&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, David.

Web. 6 May 2015. &lt;http://www.newstatesman.com/sport/2014/09/chilling-reality-sexism-football&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexism experienced by women in sports also tends to be more overt, and less subtle, than sexism in other work and organizational settings. Sexist remarks made in many workplaces have been discouraged by displays of social disapproval and the potential threat of organizational reprimand. This has forced misogynistic views to be more subtle in these settings, taking the form of [[microaggressions]] or remarks in the form of [[benevolent sexism]]. In the sports industry, in comparison, overt sexist remarks are still commonplace and tend to result in less public backlash than similar statements given in other settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fink|first=Janet|date=Jan 2016|title=Hiding in Plain Sight: The Embedded Nature of Sexism in Sport|url=|journal=Journal of Sport Management|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female athletes do not receive more attention or opportunities as compared to their male counterparts. Misogyny in sports make many people perceive women as weaklings in sporting activities. Recently, the number of females in sports has increased but not in the same percentage with that of males. For example, only fewer women participate in games such as rugby and boxing. In 2015, Don McPherson, a former National Football League (NFL) quarterback, argued that in sports boys are raised not only to be men but also not to be women (California Institute of Integral Studies). In other words, he meant that coaches ensure that young males gain enough strength to face their opponents and discourage these players to fear, which is a character associated with femininity. In sporting activities, to be masculine means to possess skills, energy, and toughness to become the victor in many tournaments. Misogyny in sports is a significant factor that contributes to shaming, objectifying, and degrading women regardless of their performance on the playing field.

==Gender gap==
===Coverage in media===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}{{Original research section|date=June 2018}}

Misogyny refers to hatred or prejudice towards women. It is manifested in several ways, such as hostility, sex discrimination, and social exclusion. Despite the popularity of sports in many societies in the world, misogyny is still prevalent in sports. In recent times, media coverage has increased the popularity of sports, but women's sports still suffers. It would be expected that both men's and women's sports are equally promoted on the media, such as television, radio and print media. Unfortunately, the coverage of women sports remains lower and shows no signs improvement; hence misogyny in media coverage of women's sports is confirmed.

There is little improvement in the coverage of women's sports by the media.  The Women's Sports and Fitness Foundation reports that only 7% percent of media coverage is devoted to women's sport. This is discouraging based on findings that over 60% of sports fans would like to watch women's sport on television. Discouragingly, the media coverage of these sports is dominated by terms, such as older, pregnant, married and unmarried thus shifting the attention from sports. In the same regard, Kelly (1) reports that men are three times likely to be mentioned in sports media than women, in a language that focuses on the sporting aspect and not the aesthetic aspects.

The efforts to popularize women sports through media coverage dependents on the online presence of broadcasters on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. However, Hull (4) reports that little efforts are being undertaken in respect to the same. A sampling of an estimated twenty thousand tweets involving two hundred broadcasters of local sports in the United States of America showed that only 5% of the tweets were related to women's sports (Hull 5). Besides, the study revealed worrying findings that female sports broadcasters tweeted more on men's sports than women's. Worst of all, the sports broadcasters in larger cities were found to be unlikely to report on women's sports.

Despite the increasing viewership of women's sports, there remains a larger disparity in the sports coverage for men's and women's sports.  Findings of a study by the Birmingham University indicates the top six newspaper in Britain had fewer stories on women sports than the previous year when Olympics was taking place. Stories concerning women's sports were outnumbered by the stories on men's sport by twenty times. These newspapers were: The mirror, sun, Times, Mail, Express, Mirror, and Telegraph.  The same study explains that a year after the 2012 Olympics, 97% of the sports coverage was on men's sports (Martinson 1). Furthermore, the study went ahead to link this scenario to the shortage of female sports journalists.

Media is influenced by many aspects of society. Equally, sporting activities attracts the attention of many people in the society. Therefore, the perception of the society towards equality and respect to women can be improved through increased coverage of women's sports on the media. The misogyny in the society can be said to be caused by the reluctance of media people to give adequate coverage to women's sports. We cannot be aiming to achieve parity in sports when the media devotes less than 5% of media coverage on women's sports. At the same time, the coverage of the women's sport should focus on sports and not on aesthetics and sexuality.  Change is urgently needed to reverse this. This change is welcome because it will influence the societies' perception towards women. Perhaps, more women should be encouraged to develop careers in sports journalism for this to be realized. Despite the existing situation, it is good to remain hopeful that women's sport will be given increased coverage because many fans are would love to see these sports on their screens.

Women's sports have been underrepresented in comparison to men in their respective sports. In 2009, [[SportsCenter]] dedicated only 1.4% of its airtime to women sports, down from 2.2% in 1999.&lt;ref name="Morales, Miguel 2014"&gt;Morales, Miguel. "Tennis' Gender Pay Gap Problem Looms On The Sidelines." Forbes. Forbes Magazine, 21 February 2014. Web. 11 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in 2013 by ''[[Science Daily]]'', they pointed out that over 2 years, only 3.6% of articles from five national Sunday papers discussed women sports, compared to 93.8% of articles devoted to men's sports.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Francis.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130918090756.htm Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting] ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the NBA (National Basketball Association) and WNBA (Women’s National Basketball Association) in-season and off-season in 2009, a study was done based on the number of stories and airtime each league had. The NBA had 72 stories totaling 66 minutes in-season and 81 stories totaling 51 minutes in the off-season. Which is significantly more than 8 stories at 5.5 minutes in-season, and 0 stories in the off-season for the WNBA. The quality of the stories themselves was significantly lower than the men, including gag stories involving sexual dialogue or emphasizing their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_sports|title=Women’s sports|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the games themselves, the women’s had lower quality, editing mistakes, and fewer camera angles. 

Research has shown that children start to learn stereotypical attitudes towards gender-appropriate actions at a very early age, and traditional images in print photographs and advertising reinforce typical gender roles. Media plays a powerful role in shaping children's perception, more so than text as children develop a sense of visual literacy earlier than written literacy. A 1990 study concluded that two thirds of photos in reading primers were of men, often shown leading more action-packed, and significant lives than the women depicted in the photographs. Several studies have shown that women are often framed as sexual objects and lesser competitors, as well as displaying more emotion than men, in many sports photographs. Many media studies suggest that they continue to "reinforce the hegemonic image that sport is a right of passage for men." Studies suggest that in Sports Illustrated, which has been labeled the most influential sports publication, men are the preeminent figures featured in photographs and feature articles within the magazine. When women are underrepresented, there is an underlying message being conveyed that they don't belong, don't exist, or have not accomplished anything.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin M, Lynn S, Walsdorf K, Hardin B.

=== Pay gap ===
[[File:Serena Williams (9634023394).jpg|thumb|Serena Williams, the highest paid woman in sports in 2017]]
The pay gap in sports seems to arise depending on the gender and the type of sport. Based on athletics data in 2009, female athletes earned 23.4 percent less than male athletes.&lt;ref name="Morales, Miguel 2014" /&gt; In 2014, based on Arsenal's performance data, Arsenal's women soccer team earned less than the men's team. The women's team earned five thousand dollars as opposed to the men's whose pay scale was $1.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kwakye|first1=Jeanette|date=31 October 2014|title=Female sport stars should earn the same as their male counterparts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/31/female-sport-stars-male-prize-money|journal=The Guardian|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gap does not only apply to athletes, but also to members of the teams coaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minnlawyer.com/2016/05/05/u-s-womens-soccer-issues-red-card-to-pay-gap/|title=U.S. women’s soccer issues red card to pay gap|last=Sharma|first=Aalok|date=May 5, 2016|website=Minnlawyer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been conducted to discover the emergence of the pay gap in sports. An employment strategy conducted in European Union member states shows disparity in pay between male and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubery|first=Jill|date=|title=How to close the gender pay gap in Europe: towards the gender mainstreaming of pay policy|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2338.2005.00353.x|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|volume=36:3|pages=184|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was how players and coaches are paid determined by gender and the sport they participate in. The results showed that the coaches of the male team had a much greater salary than the coaches of the women's team.  In 2001, the average salary for coaches of woman's teams in Division 1 was $38,191, while coaches of men's teams earned an average of $61,534.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Jennifer|date=2001|title=Female Coaches Lag In Pay And Opportunities To Oversee Men's Teams|issue=Chronicles Of Higher Education|pages=47.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At Division 1 I-FBS Schools in the USA, the median head coaches' salaries were $2,257,600 higher for men in comparison to their women counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/research/article-and-report/elite-athletes/pay-inequity/|title=Pay Inequity in Athletics - Women's Sports Foundation|work=Women's Sports Foundation|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by Michigan State University found that the salaries for both men and women Division 1 coaches was determined by both gender and type of sport. It showed that coaching males has a more positive impact on a coaches salary than coaching females did, and because of this, both athletic directors and men's coaches have a high interest in maintaining and reinforcing the status quo, which indicates that the lowest paying coaching jobs are held by women.&lt;ref&gt;Knoppers A, Meyer B, Ewing M, Forrest L. Gender and the Salaries of Coaches. Sociology Of Sport Journal [serial online]. December 1989;6(4):348-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, tennis remains as the one sport that has the most comparable and fair pay between men and women. Tennis receives the most media coverage than any other women’s sport, and through social media, is continuing to experience growth in popularity. According to Forbes, eight of the top ten best paid women athletes are tennis players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/08/14/the-highest-paid-female-athletes-2017/#73e01d993d0b|title=Serena Williams Heads The Highest-Paid Female Athletes 2017|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|date=August 14, 2017|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 research conducted by three professors from Brigham Young University found that male and female tennis players have the same employers at 21 events, including the four grand-slam tournaments ([[Australian Open]], [[French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Flake C, Dufur M, Moore E. Advantage men: The sex pay gap in professional tennis. International Review For The Sociology Of Sport [serial online]. June 2013;48(3):366-376.&lt;/ref&gt; While, in most other sports, women’s associations have different sponsorships and media coverage.

The 2007 Wimbledon Championships was the first tournament that offered equal prize money for male and female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/11/2007-wimbledon-offers-equal-prize-money/56891/|title=2007: WIMBLEDON OFFERS EQUAL PRIZE MONEY|last=Tignor|first=Steve|date=November 28, 2015|website=Tennis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this may be the case during televised events and the grand slams, women are still not receiving as much in middle- and low- tier events; the most popular rationalization being that men play longer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although it is true that men players are required to play a best-of-5 set and that women players are only required to play best-of-3-sets, other than during the grand slams, this does not apply to any other tournaments. Another argument for unequal pay is that men generate more revenue through higher television ratings and attendance. However, most tournament tickets grant spectators access to both men’s and women’s matches on that day. So, aside from counting the numbers of viewers per match, it is difficult to determine revenues in tournaments where both sexes play. Finally, there is also evidence that ratings are mostly equal, with some cases indicating women being higher than men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women’s annual median pay gap in the United States was 19% lower than the men.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shannessy, C. (2018). Is Women’s Game Weaker? Nope. Check the Stat Sheet. ''New York Times,167''(58067), D3-D3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of the continued wage gap tend to say that men deserve to be paid more because they are stronger and have greater attendance rates.  However, when examining statistics, this opinion is unsupported. In the 2015 Open, the men's champion, [[Novak Djokovic]], served a 125 mph serve.  [[Serena Williams]] topped this by 1 mph.  In 2008 at Wimbledon, the fastest serve in the women’s final was 129 mph, the same as the fastest serve in the men’s final.  A fan of unfair pay may say that women deserve to be paid less because their sporting events are less entertaining.  However, the main reason for boredom in tennis is long, drawn out points, generally defined as nine rallies or more.  In the 2017 open, “long rallies” accounted for 11% of the points in men’s matches, with only about a 1% difference at 12.2% for women.  These supporters also like to complain that women tend to use backhands more often than forehands in comparison to men. Both are untrue as backhand winners fall in at 35.7% for women and 30.2% for men.&lt;ref&gt;Flake, C. R., Dufur, M. J., &amp; Moore, E. L. (2012). Advantage men: The sex pay gap in professional tennis. ''International Review for the Sociology of Sport,48''(3), 366-376. doi:10.1177/1012690212442166&lt;/ref&gt;  According to statistical analysis, women and men’s tennis games are within comparable measures.  As for attendance rates, these are difficult to calculate because most tickets for matches are sold as a pair for the women and men’s game.  The only true way to determine the audience size would be to do a head count at every match.

There are some who believe that the problem in trying to explain the gender pay gap, is that they are trying to justify why it exists instead of addressing the problem of why it exists in the first place. Karen Farquharson, who is a professor at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology, says the problem is a societal thing that results from not valuing women in the society. Karen admits that women are not strong as men but it does not mean they are not entertaining and competitive. The main reason why they remain less in sports is that the society is patriarchal and male-dominated especially when it comes to sports. This means that sports are like a vicious circle and broadcasters just take advantage of it to only broadcast male games continuously leaving out women thinking they are not interested.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;Morales, Miguel. "Tennis' Gender Pay Gap Problem Looms On The Sidelines." Forbes. Forbes Magazine, 21 February 2014.

Additionally, female athletes are still not receiving as much non-sexist and positive attention then male athletes. Women sometimes compete under certain conditions that give them less respect than their male peers. Women athletes still face problems of sexual harassment, and over-training associated with eating disorders and body image. The U.S. women’s soccer team, which is ranked much higher than the men’s, enjoy much less recognition, popularity, and pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Valarie|date=2012|title=The Inequality of Sport: Women &lt; Men|url=https://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=ur|journal=The Review: A Journal of Undergraduate Student Research|volume=13|pages=|via=Fisher Digital Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such allegations and improper judgment on women have led some players to take a step and sue their federation for discrimination. On 30 March 2016, five top U.S women players, [[Hope Solo]], [[Carli Lloyd]], [[Megan Rapinoe]], [[Alex Morgan]] and [[Becky Sauerbrunn]], filed a lawsuit against the Soccer Federation to demand equal employment opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html|title=Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination|last=Das|first=Andrew|date=31 March 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=4 April 2016|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint alleges that women on the national soccer team make about 40% of what their male counterparts do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/4277843/us-womens-soccer-equal-pay/|title=MONEY|last=Close|first=Kerry|website=MONEY.com|access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female athletes across all sports may win more trophies and medals, but more often than not, this does not translate to equal payment. Toughness of competition, more lenient rules, and difference in skill levels are just a couple excuses made to disregard this very real social issue.

==Title IX==
[[File:Title IX Harassment and Assault Awareness Ribbon.PNG|thumbnail|Title IX Harassment and Assault Awareness Ribbon]]
{{Main|Title IX}}
Girls and women have been discriminated and denied sports opportunities for quite a long time. For years, women and girls were comfortable with the stereotypes that were attached with the concept of women in sports but with time, different organizations and feminists have come up with strategies to uplift the participation rates of women and girls in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-53318-0_4|title="Sporting Females: Power, Diversity and the Body."

Title IX for example is a legislation that was passed in 1972 to that provided different provisions that protected the rights of equality in sports for women and girls. It is a law that requires all educational programs receiving federal funding to provide equity for both boys and girls. Over the years, the law has been subject to over 20 proposed amendments, reviews, and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases. The law has acted as a way of motivating women and girls to participate more in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-53318-0_4|title="Sporting Females: Power, Diversity and the Body."

The participation of girls and women in sports has brought about numerous immediate and long-term benefits that have a lasting impact on both the female gender and the society at large.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Guest, Andrew M., and Anne Luijten. "Fan culture and motivation in the context of successful women’s professional team sports: a mixed-methods case study of Portland Thorns fandom." ''Sport in Society'' (2017): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the different provisions of the ‘Title IX’ include equality in the different sports fields for both sexes. Essentially, this provision is aimed at placing women at an advantage in athletics and sports. However, it is important that such provisions do not necessarily imply that equal amounts are spent on sports activities and matters for both sexes and athletic opportunities for boys and men to be reduced but simply means that both women and girls should not be discouraged and denied any sports opportunities. But there are still thousands of schools across the county are not in compliance with Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;"Title IX." TitleIX.info. Title IX, n.d. Web. 30 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The law covers all educational activities that receive public funding, so even though sports receive little public funding, they are still subject to Title IX, and are the most well-known application of the law. Opponents of the law say that has led to a break down of men's sports, pointing to the number of schools and institutions that have dropped sports since the enactment of Title IX, such as wrestling and cross-country.&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, Donald E. (2001). "Equally Bad is Not Good: Allowing Title IX "Compliance" by the Elimination of Men's Collegiate Sports".

Web. 4 May 2015 &lt;http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/wrestling.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the law, only 295,000 girls participated in high school sports and they received only 2% of the athletic budget. In 2016-2017, that number had risen to 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the country.&lt;ref&gt;"The Next Generation of Title IX." Title IX 40 Years and Counting (2012): n. pag. National Women's Law Center. June 2012.

Various studies have found that those who participate in high school athletics have higher wages, educational attainment, and educational aspirations later on in life. The rise in opportunities to participate in sports has led to a similar rise in labor force participation, which leads to more women with positive earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Betsey Stevenson, 2010. "Beyond the Classroom: Using Title IX to Measure the Return to High School Sports," The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 92(2), pages 284-301, 08&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the enactment of Title IX, women have made strides in college athletics for years. Other factors such as body shaping and fan culture are some of the motivation strategies that concerned individuals in the society are taking up to increase women and girl’s participation in sports.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, it should be noted that more enforcement strategies need to be put in place to increase women and girl participation in sports since women discrimination in sports has not been completely eradicated since in some cases, women and girl’s participation in sports is not approved.&lt;ref&gt;Kissane, Rebecca Joyce, and Sarah Winslow. "“You’re Underestimating Me and You Shouldn’t” Women’s Agency in Fantasy Sports." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 30.5 (2016): 819-841.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scholarships ===
Before the Title IX, Equal Opportunity Law was established, not a single sports scholarship was given women in college sports in the United States. Since then, the number of scholarships given to women has increased each year to almost 85,000 scholarships in 2012, based on the “Number of Available College Athletic Scholarships”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scholarshipstats.com/default.htm|title=Number of Available College Athletic Scholarships|last=O’Rourke|first=Patrick|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 92,000 Scholarships available for men in that year.

The Title IX legislation was passed in 1972 and required schools that received federal funding to provide equality for boys and girls. Or having the same amount of male sports teams as women. Because of that, many schools or universities have dropped specific sports teams such as wrestling and men's soccer. Before the law, less than 300,000 girls participated in high school sports, receiving 2% of the sports budget. Since then, that number has increased to over 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the United States.

== Women's opportunities and their leadership roles ==
Although Title IX encouraged more women to participate in sports at an NCAA level, the number of women in leadership roles drastically decreased. Women in senior decision making roles devolved to a number of 18% and women in athletic director positions held only 17% in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/|title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport|last=Senne|first=Joshua A.|date=Feb 26, 2016|website=The Sport Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Apr 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although major strides have been taken by people in all realms of the sports industry to create more opportunities for women, women are still underrepresented in the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burton|first=LJ|date=2015|title=Review: Underrepresentation of women in sport leadership: A review of research|url=|journal=Sports Management Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[NCAA]], only 8.3% of Division I athletics directors are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Final%2B2012%2BCollege%2BRGRC.pdf|title=The 2012 Racial and Gender Report Card: College Sport|last=Lapchick|first=Richard|date=2012|website=NCAA|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 21% of college women's athletic programs are headed by women, and women fill only 33% of all administrative jobs in women's programs. In high school, less than 20% of athletic directors are women, and less than 40% of directors of physical education are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/research/sports/sports3.html|title=Empowering Women in Sports|last=|first=|date=1995|website=Feminist Majority Foundation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An American Society of New Editors (ASNE) newsroom census report in 1991 showed 63.1% of newsroom were men and 36.9% were women. In 2012, the percentages had not changed. By 2013, the statistics were slightly worse, showing 63.7% were men and 36.3% were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/2014/media-is-failing-women-sports-journalism-particularly-so/240240/|title=Media is 'failing women' — sports journalism particularly so|last=Morrison|first=Sara|date=19 February 2014|website=Poynter|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues still remaining in terms of gender inequality in sport include the pay gap discrepancies, lack of opportunities for women in a male dominant industry, and lack of media coverage for women athletes. While there are women who enter top management positions in this industry, men typically receive a greater number of opportunities. Hegemony is described as a state of a “ruling class” referring to men at the forefront of society. This concept reaffirms the status quo that men demand authority in a society from imposition, manipulation, and even consent from certain groups. Due to this restricting concept, women find it much harder to advance in leadership roles simply due to what has already been set in motion by previous generations and previous cultures.

Through the role congruity theory, Eagly and Karau explained similarities between gender roles and leadership roles, which suggested prejudice toward female leader and potential leaders take two forms.  "The first form showed a less favorable evaluation of women's potential for leadership because leadership ability is more stereotypical of men than women. The second form showed a less favorable evaluation of the actual leadership behavior of women than men because such behavior is perceived less desirable in women than men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whisenant|first=Warren|date=2015|title=Role Congruity Theory: Perceptions of Fairness and Sexism in Sport Management|url=http://libezp.lib.lsu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ecn&amp;AN=1536517&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|journal=EconLit|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research established view points and supportive information on why there are less women in leadership roles than men throughout the sport industry.

The issues women face in sports off the field are not only unique to the United States, and as the spectrum broadens, one can see that the disparity of women in sports governance positions decreases. Some have suggested to require quotas for women to participate in governance of sports programs, but even this solution is flawed. Suggesting that a company makes requirements in their recruitment to seek out women would only be done to achieve a certain number, and not because they actually want to do so in the first place. Instead, these organizations should focus on achieving targets that come close to a standard of around 40% of women representation. This number has been positively associated with correct board governance and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adriaanse|first=Johanna|date=2014|title=The Impact of Gender Quotas on Gender Equality in Sport Governance|url=http://eige.europa.eu/resources/2014_Genderquotasandgenderequalityinsportgovernance.pdf|journal=Journal of Sports Management|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment in the workplace ==
In her book, "Sexual Harassment in the Workplace",  Mary Boland argues that [[sexual harassment]] is a personal attack on a woman's mind and body, that installs fear and violates her right to bodily integrity education, and freedom of movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|last=Boland|first=Mary|publisher=Sphinx Publications|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)'' "working women face higher risks than men from job-related stress, and one of the most noxious stressors sexual harassment."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In reference to the toll that it takes on women, Boland states "victims suffer physical, mental, emotional, and financial losses that can be devastating."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to a study conducted by the Journal of Sport Management, over 50% of 112 respondents reported they encountered some form of sexual harassment over the past 12 months prior to the study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As reported by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida in 2012, 90% of sports editors and 88% of sports reporters are men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The disproportion between men and women in this position may discourage female sport media print professionals from reporting such incidents of sexual harassment according to an article published by Christina Coleburn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regardless of the field in which women work, sexual harassment in the workplace is alive and well and in the [[Sport industry|sports industry]], it is common. Women in powerful or governance position are often viewed as too assertive, thus receiving harassment for challenging the preconceived notion of a hierarchy. These women in power also report more instances of sexual harassment in the workplace, because of their threat to the status quo. Studies also suggest that a women in a supervisor position will report more instances of sexual harassment due to their intelligence, knowledge, and experience in a workplace environment where they hold power. Targets of sexual harassment are more likely to be female because they may have masculine tendencies, and men feel the need to reassure their “masculine dominance”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mclaughlin|first=Heather|date=2012|title=Sexual Harassment, Workplace Authority, and the Paradox of Power|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=|pages=625–647|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of awareness of sexual harassment in the sports industry is extremely concerning for progressive movements towards equality. A study done in 2011 in Quebec called “Disclosure of Sexual Abuse in Sport Organizations: A Case Study” points to the many problems in sports organizations. Most instances point to women rarely, if ever, reporting assault or harassment in the sports business. Most coaches, athletes, and administrators were not even aware of existing protocols of sexual harassment. When questioned about this concerning issue, the administrators resorted back to their lawyers; assuming that the issue was for too complicated to tackle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=endsexualexploitation.org/articles/sexual-exploitation-sports-industry-abuse-power/|title=Sexual Exploitation in the Sports Industry: An Abuse of Power|last=Urie|first=Marie|date=2018|website=endsexualexploitation.org|publisher=National Center on Sexual Exploitation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal]] that occurred over the course of several years, but came to light in the latter months of 2017 and early 2018 involved former doctor [[Larry Nassar]].  More than 250 young women accused Nassar of sexual harassment and abuse. Many of these women were seen and treated by Nassar as a gymnast. Because of his role as the USA gymnastics team doctor, Nassar was able to be alone with hundreds of young women and girls over the course of nearly two decades. Women can often be afraid to come forward with these allegations because of how it may affect their career and how others may see them afterwards. [[Aly Raisman]], a USA Gymnast, explained how the abuse from Nassar had occurred from such a young age, that despite strange thoughts about his treatment methods, she was taught to trust him which is why it took so long to figure out what was happening to her and many other gymnasts and come forward about it.&lt;ref&gt;LaPook, J., Dr. (2018, September 9).

According to associate director of research at Pew Research Center, Katie Simmons, "a woman's main role has always been to be a wife, and then a mother. Women have been stereotyped for years as being the less intellectual and weaker sex."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Katie|date=2011|title=Women in Top Management Positions in the Sport Industry: Breaking Down the Barriers and Stereotypes|url=http://fisherpub.sjfc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=sport_undergrad|journal=Sport Management Undergraduate|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often objectified in the sport industry, and judged solely on the way they look, especially now when social media has become more and more mainstream.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6073">The '''National Letter of Intent''' ('''NLI''') is a document used to indicate a [[student athlete]]'s commitment to participating [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) colleges and universities in the [[United States]].  The NCAA Eligibility Center manages the daily operations of the NLI program while the Collegiate Commissioners Association (CCA) provides governance oversight of the program. Started in 1964 with seven conferences and eight independent institutions, the program now includes 676 [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and [[NCAA Division II|II]] participating institutions.  There are designated dates for different sports, and these dates are commonly referred to as "Signing Day".

[[NCAA Division III|Division III]] institutions are specifically banned from using the NLI, or any similar document that is not executed by non-athletes at those institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D313.pdf |title=Bylaw 13.9.1 Letter-of-intent Prohibition |work=2016–17 NCAA Division III Manual |publisher=NCAA |format=PDF |page=78 |accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NLIs are typically faxed by the recruited student to the university's athletic department on a [[National Signing Day]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news |title=In College Football Recruiting, The Star Player Is the Fax Machine |first=Darren |last=Everson |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703445904576118213111942984 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=February 2, 2011 |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NLI is a voluntary program with regard to both institutions and student-athletes. No prospective student-athlete or parent is required to sign the National Letter of Intent, and no institution is required to join the program.

== History ==
[[J. William Davis]], Professor of Government and Faculty Athletics Representative at Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]]), created the National Letter of Intent program in [[1964 in sports|1964]]. He was assisted by Howard Grubbs, who was Commissioner of the [[Southwest Conference]] at the time. In October [[2007 in sports|2007]], the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] became responsible for the administration of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national-letter.org/history History of the National Letter of Intent Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313152547/http://www.national-letter.org/history/ |date=2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NLIs and the recruiting process ==
[[File:20121220 Jabari Parker verbal commitment press conference team hats.JPG|thumb|[[Blue chip (sports)|Blue chip]] athletes often end [[:w:Recruiting (college athletics)|recruiting]] with a hat selection ceremony in which they make a verbal commitment, which generally leads to the formal signing of a National Letter of Intent.]]
National Letters of Intent may only be signed by prospective student-athletes who will be entering a four-year institution for the first time in the academic year after they sign the NLI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Letter of Intent: Text of the National Letter of Intent|url=http://www.national-letter.org/guidelines/nli_text.php|accessdate=2007-12-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108131035/http://www.national-letter.org/guidelines/nli_text.php|archivedate=2008-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits who have signed NLIs must attend the schools they have signed with in order to receive financial aid, and NCAA rules forbid coaches from recruiting them further; these restrictions aim to add certainty to the recruiting process for players (who are certain to receive aid) and coaches (who are certain that a recruit will attend their school).&lt;ref name="nloi_overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Letter of Intent: Overview|url=http://www.national-letter.org/overview/|accessdate=2007-12-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230233011/http://www.national-letter.org/overview/|archivedate=2007-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, verbal commitments are nonbinding; recruits may change or revoke a verbal commitment at any time, and coaches may continue to recruit a verbally committed player.&lt;ref name="verbal_commit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Verbal Commitment Circle|url=http://studentsports.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=504616|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictive nature of the NLI is designed to be advantageous to both prospective student-athletes and intercollegiate athletics programs. Intercollegiate athletics departments are not required to provide financial aid in cases where a student-athlete is not admitted for academic reasons. [[Seth Davis]], a columnist for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', has suggested that this arrangement is actually disadvantageous to student-athletes, as they have no recourse if an athletics department decides not to admit a player for non-academic reasons; for example, an athletics department could replace a signed recruit with another recruit by claiming that the first one was not admitted for academic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seth Davis: For recruits, letters of intent are not the best option|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/seth_davis/11/13/national.letter/index.html|accessdate=2007-12-31 | work=CNN | date=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faxing of letters==
Given the methods of transmitting NLIs that are available under NCAA rules, the letters are typically faxed by students to the university's athletic department.&lt;Ref name=WSJ /&gt;

Although NCAA rules allow for use of postal mail and courier, and electronic transmission, nearly all students opt for fax machines, because of the speed of transmission and the ease of verifying signatures sent that way.&lt;Ref name=WSJ /&gt;

An '''odds compiler''' (or '''trader''') is a person employed by a [[bookmaker]] or [[betting exchange]] who sets the [[odds]] for events (such as [[sports betting|sporting outcomes]]) for customers to place [[gambling|bets]] on. Apart from pricing markets, they also engage in any activity regarding the trading aspects of gambling, such as monitoring customer accounts and the profitability of their operations.

The odds are derived from a variety of factors through analysis of information. Certain markets are highly [[statistics|statistical]], whereas other markets require more intuition and insight. An odds compiler may be required to monitor the financial position the bookmaker is in and adjust their position (and odds) accordingly. They may also be consulted as to whether to accept a bet or not, usually in the case where a very large bet is being placed, so as to not incur dangerously-high liabilities. Odds are usually not set completely independent from other bookmakers but are influenced by what others are quoting. This is particularly important when the overround is below 100% and hence [[arbitrage betting]], where betters can make a profit regardless of the outcome, is possible (see [[mathematics of bookmaking]]). In this case, the bookmaker with the most aberrant odds would usually alter their odds closer to other bookmakers' prices. The odds are influenced by betting volume so that a selection receiving a high volume of liquidity may have the odds for it cut.

In 2006, there were news reports that the only female odds compiler in the United Kingdom was a woman called Helen Jacob of [[Sky Betting and Gaming|Sky Bet]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, Alex (29 June 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Open chain exercises''' (OKC) are exercises that are performed where the [[hand]] or foot is free to move. The opposite of OKC are [[closed kinetic chain exercises]] (CKC). Both are effective for strengthening and rehabilitation objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Open and closed kinetic chain exercises improve shoulder joint reposition sense equally in healthy subjects. Rogol IM, Ernst G, Perrin DH.

[[Image:Pinboys nclc.04636.jpg|thumb|April 1910: 1:00 A.M. Pin boys working in Subway Bowling Alleys, 65 South St., [[Brooklyn, New York]], [[Lewis Hine]] photo]]
[[Image:Bowlingbahn.jpg|thumb|Automated pinsetter sets up bowling pins]]{{Use American English|date=July 2017}}[[Image:Pinsetter patent 2973204 diagram excerpt crop.png|thumb|Brunswick Model A pinsetter diagram from US patent 2973204.]]

In [[bowling]], a '''pinsetter''', or '''pinspotter''', was originally a person who manually reset [[bowling pin]]s to their correct position, cleared fallen pins, and returned [[bowling ball]]s to players.  Probably due to the nature of the work (low-paid, often part-time, manual labor that most frequently took place evenings), many pinsetters were teenage boys, and thus '''pinboy''' is another name used to describe the job. Gottfried (Fred) Schmidt invented the '''mechanical pinsetter''' and sold the patent in 1941 to [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. &lt;!-- according to [[Timeline of invention]] --&gt; While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams.

Many mechanical pinsetters are integrated with electronic scoring systems of varying sophistication. While many pinsetters have a manual reset button to use in case the pinsetter does not automatically activate at the correct time, other types have no automatic tracking of the state of the game – especially for the [[candlepin bowling|candlepin]] and [[duckpin bowling|duckpin]] bowling sports which use smaller balls – and are almost always manually activated.

==Common terms and design features==

&lt;!-- this needs illustrations/photos --&gt;
The design of the machines varies, depending both in individual company's hardware designs, and for the particular bowling sport's playing rules and equipment specifications. Several types of bowling make use of different designs for machines due to the different size and shape of the pins and balls.  Common part descriptions for just about all pinspotting units consist of:

* '''Rake/Sweep Bar''' – removes fallen and leftover pins from the pin deck area of the lane. The sweep may also stay lowered throughout the table operating cycle, to act as the primary physical protective barrier against improperly thrown balls
* '''Spotting Deck/Table''' – also used in pre-automated manual units (often, as their sole mechanical device); places a new "rack" of pins onto the lane for the next frame; and in tenpins and duckpins for automatic units, lifts the remaining pins for the sweep to remove fallen pins for the bowler's next roll of the ball in those games
* '''Deck/Table Shield''' ''(Brunswick A series only)'' – a fixed sheet metal enclosure, usually fastened to the spotting table's framework and diagonal forward frame edges, provides secondary protection for the spotting table system from improperly thrown balls (in addition to the sweep bar) and flying pins, and covers the pin chutes that are used to transfer the pins from the characteristic, cage-like Brunswick-design rotating pin storage turret above the table downwards into the deck for transfer onto the lane's pin deck area.
* '''Pit''' – a collection area behind the lane where balls and struck pins collect for sorting, actually a part of any regulation bowling lane.
* '''Pin Elevator''' –  brings pins upwards out of the lane's pit to the top of the unit for re-racking for successive frames, usually in the form of a vertically-oriented toroid-shape system at the extreme rear of the pinspotter for tenpin bowling units, to deliver pins upwards from the pit into the pin storage system. 
* A system of '''pin storage''' for storing the next full "rack" of pins after delivery to it by the pin [[elevator]] system – this can exist within (or as part of) the table, or above and/or behind the table
* '''Ball Return''' (or "Ball Lift") – Removes the bowler's ball from the lane's "pit" and sends it rolling back to the bowler on the ball return track, located between paired lane beds, back to the ball return unit at the "heads" of the lanes. The ball lift's components are designed to physically separate the ball from the fallen pins in the pit, and will not send pins into the ball return track.

===Manually-reloaded spotting table units===
In the decades leading up to the introduction of the fully automatic units, "semi-automatic" pinsetters, such as the "B-1" and "B-10" units made by [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick]], basically consisting of just a manually filled "table" similar to those used on the fully automatic units, operating much as the later units' component of the same name operated, were used by human pinsetters to both speed up the manual operation, and assure accuracy of "spotting" the full rack of ten pins for the next frame.[http://oldbowling.com/page3.html] The oldest operational bowling facility in the United States, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]'s ''[[Holler House]]'', opened in September 1908, is one of the very few all-manually operated alleys remaining in the 21st century that still uses the Brunswick "table-style" manual units.

==[[Ten-pin]] pinsetters==

===AMF pinspotters===
The AMF family of pinspotters, first marketed in 1952&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldbowling.com/page2.html oldbowling.com]&lt;/ref&gt; are the first ones used in quantity in the industry.  They have changed little since the mass-produced 82-30 version.  There are three main pinspotter models, the aforementioned 82-30 (no longer produced, but still in common use, ever since the 1960s US bowling boom and the early career of [[Dick Weber]]), the 82-70 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irb-AzXzc1M prototyped in 1962], and still in production, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irb-AzXzc1M since 1963]) and the newest versions, the 82-90 and the 82-90XLI, both of which use the 82-70's general mechanical design. AMF pinspotters were originated by [[American Machine and Foundry]] and are now manufactured by [[QubicaAMF Worldwide]]. All operate generally the same way with small improvements.

The 82-30's operation and mechanics, having been significantly developed from AMF's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DogVYVOqMNg pioneering 82-10 experimental model], which depended much on the use of suction to hold the pins in a double-sided spotting table for both spotting remaining pins and setup of new racks of pins, are quite different from the Model A, A-2 and JetBack units from Brunswick (which the AMF 82-10 pre-dated by almost a decade), with differing sweep and table designs, and especially in how the pins are handled for storage, after they got to the top of the machinery. After the bowler rolls their ball, and knocking down the pins, the ball strikes the pit cushion block. This activates the machine, which lowers the sweep to the guard position. Then the table descends and the respot cells close around each neck of the standing pins. The cells that have pins in them complete electrical circuits that send scoring information to the display, and turned on one or more of ten "pindicator" lights – pioneered by AMF in May 1953 – in an electrically illuminated triangular framed screen on the pinspotter's masking unit in front of the machine, to identify remaining pins.

After the table lifts the remaining pins, the machine runs the sweep, clearing dead pins from the pin deck, then returns to the guard position. Ball and pins travel on a continuously running [[conveyor belt|carpet belt]] at the bottom of the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a "distributor arm" that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, [https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pages/US2983510-1.png an "arrowhead"-planform guide rail atop the spotting table] governs the distributor's head piece movements) over the table [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GI5VvqXQBU as seen here], to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or "spotting cups" as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle. In the 82-30, its semi-cylindrical "spotting cup" bins are part of the visible spotting table (unique to the design of the 82-30) suspended below the table's frame, each at a roughly a 45° angle with each "cup" inclined, pin-base-forward, in front of each spotting cell, and clearly visible to the bowler whenever the table approaches its lowermost position. After the table returns to its upper position, the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new rack of pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w0p_C250Iw as seen here] to clear the new rack of pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new rack of pins spotted on the lane for the next frame. Should the spotting cups not yet be filled with a full rack of ten pins for the next frame, the sweep bar pauses in its forward "guard" position after its rearwards stroke to clear any fallen pins, until the cups all have pins in them, with the table only descending when the cups have all filled, and are ready to set them onto the pindeck.

Beginning in December 1961, the 82-30 units also became famous for having the "Sparemaker" version of the earlier triangular pindicator screen on their masking units as advertised by AMF and their staff's pro bowler Dick Weber, which added a set of eleven lighted "arrows" to the usual numbered ten lights for standing pins, triangular corner lights that indicated the first or second ball to be rolled, and separate lights to indicate a foul, or a strike.  The "arrows" were for the purpose of advising an inexperienced bowler to assist in [[spare (bowling)|spare]] conversion, by indicating where a second ball delivery should hit the remaining pins for a successful conversion, and were triggered by appropriate combinations of standing pins that helped the machine select which one of the eleven arrows to illuminate. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/iwilldare/691217804/sizes/l/ Rear view of an AMF Magic Triangle screen] [http://www.google.com/patents?id=_ttNAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=American+Machine+%26+Foundry+pinspotter&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false and the patent document for it]

There have been specific upgrades and improvements made to the machines produced after the 82-30, with after-market solid-state/microprocessor-operated controllers available for the 82-30 itself. The 82-70 is the general standard in most AMF-equipped modern bowling centers today. It features a [[microprocessor]]-operated chassis that is upgraded to short cycle the machine for strikes, gutter balls, or 7–10 pick-offs. It features solid state motors. The 82-90 and the 82-90XLI are further upgrades, basically using the 82-70's mechanics, which replaced the older, completely electro-mechanical controls with machine status indicator lights, much more sophisticated "pin storage" design, single control centers that handle two machines, and perhaps the most important upgrade is the self shutdown control, which shuts the machine down to prevent damage from continuing to operate with a fault. The 82-90 models feature a deck that is thinner than the 82-70.

[[QubicaAMF Worldwide]] has also introduced many different scoring systems that are compatible with all pinsetters and pinspotters.

===Brunswick A series pinsetters===
The [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick]] Model A, dating from 1956, as well as the developed '''A2''' (1962) and the '''JetBack''' (1965) versions of it, work as follows.

First, the balls and pins are pushed off the end of the lane by the rake onto a shaking board the width of the lane, in place of the AMF-variety carpet belt. This "shaker" transfers the ball and pins to the rear of the pit, behind the lane's pindeck. Two large rotating wheels, at the center rear of the unit, are situated with their common axis along the bowling lane. The ball-lift wheel is the one closer to the bowler and is smooth on its inside surfaces, with enough space between its inner and outer surfaces to allow the fallen pins to go rearwards through it into the rear-located pin-wheel (or pin elevator), placed behind the ball return wheel which has seven pockets, which capture the pins, and is somewhat similar to the AMF unit's design.

When a ball rolls back to the ball-lift wheel, friction lifts the ball up to the side where it catches on two lift rods covered with a rubber material. Wedged in between, the ball is rolled upward. When it gets to the top, it is deposited onto a metal track that usually leads underground, and is pushed along by a long accelerator belt. Finally, the ball is pushed upward by two wheels located at the head of the ball return track, where it is deposited.

When a pin rolls back, the smaller diameter of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first.  The wheel brings the pin to the top and drops it into a metal tray, called a "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop into the pan base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a [[conveyor belt]] lifts the pin up towards the top of the pinsetter, to drop into a rotating metal basket called the "pin turret", letting it slide into one of ten cells as the turret rotates – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin.  When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute in the center of the turret being filled last.  Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them through its full downward travel onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck. As the table lowers towards the pindeck to set the new rack of pins, it is visibly protected with its attached sheet metal "deck shield", visible to the bowler at any time the spotting table needs to either descend part-way to handle standing pins after the first ball, or to fully descend (once loaded from the pin-turret above it) to set the new rack of pins for the next frame.  The Model A/JetBack series pinsetters characteristically halt their operation, should the pin turret not yet be full of pins for the next frame, by pausing the sweep bar at the back of its rearwards travel and holding the table in its fully elevated position, until the pin-turret fills and releases its load into the spotting table's upper level.

This style of machine is typically loaded with 20 pins, though most proprietors normally put in 21 pins to facilitate quicker loading and faster operation of the pinsetter, especially in cases where the bowler(s) make two strikes in quick succession — on all the Model A-based unit designs, the "second ball cycle" used for both a second ball's delivery or a strike won't complete if the turret is not full, with the deck waiting in its elevated position as stated previously.  Adding an extra pin does not put undue stress on the machine, but adding more than that is not advisable due to damage that can occur to the machine.  Other centers will only load the pinsetter with 19 pins.  Having only 19 pins in the machine will cause fewer stops from time to time but it will slow down the progress of the game if multiple strikes are thrown in succession.

The later A2 and JetBack versions, otherwise each virtually identical to the original Model A design, were augmented enough to have much faster ball return action than the original Model A units.  the A-2 was also designed to be a faster machine overall to increase the number of frames that could be bowled in a given time frame, thus increasing the revenue of the bowling center.

The visible deck shield, as well as the noticeable sounds of pins entering the pin elevator (sounding like bowling pins rattling in a metal drum) and of the next set of pins dropping from the turret into the deck chutes, are unique to the Brunswick A series. There is a large Brunswick "crowned-B" (their 1950s logo) on the front of the deck shield of the Model A, "A-2" on the A-2 deck shield front, and "JetBack" on the JetBack deck shield front, unless these markings have been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.

===Brunswick GS series pinsetters===
The GSX is [[Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards|Brunswick's]] current pinsetter. This machine uses a conveyor belt on the pit floor to move the pins to a vertical elevator system similar to the ones utilized on the AMF 82 series pinspotters, while the ball exits the pit at the side through a ball door. Pins are loaded using a combination of belts.  The ball return system on this machine uses an under-lane accelerator as opposed to a lift. It lowers the pin table on every cycle to determine scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Stuff Works on Pinsetters|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/pinsetter2.htm|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original model in the GS series (GS stands for Game Setter) was the GS-10, which was principally designed by Augusti Schmid in Scherzenbach, Switzerland to promote the sport of bowling throughout Europe. In 1984, Brunswick Bowling &amp; Billiards Corporation acquired the rights to manufacture and sell the GS-10 pinsetter. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary. The electronic control system is manufactured in Michigan, near the Brunswick plant located in Muskegon, Michigan. Subsequent models (year of introduction is in parentheses):&lt;ref name="gshistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=GS-Series Pinsetter Operation and Service Manual, January 2001, Part number 47-902735-000|url=http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|publisher=Brunswick|accessdate=2014-01-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214238/http://www.bwt-innovative-solutions.cba.pl/instrukcje/GS98%20operations.pdf|archivedate=2014-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*GS-92 (1991) – Incorporated changes to the pinsetter to make it quicker to install and easier to service.
*GS-96 (1995) – Incorporated changes in the software and hardware to speed up loading time of the pinsetter.
*GS-98 (1997) – Incorporated a new consolidated electronic system that uses a two control box system to reduce the number of printed circuit boards needed to operate the pinsetter. Also, software and hardware improvements to make the pinsetter more efficient and user-friendly.
*GS-X (1999) – Incorporated a setting table and ball accelerator redesign that reduced the number of parts, the number of adjustments, and the amount of preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required.&lt;ref name="gshistory"/&gt;

The GS is characterized by a sweep that rotates downward (as opposed to dropping) as soon as the ball enters the pin deck. A GS-X shows “gsx” on the sweep when it is down, unless this marking has been removed or covered by the bowling center proprietor.

===Other types of ten-pin pinsetters===
The Mendes company produced a magnetic pinsetter known as the MM-2001.  It featured a flat magnetic pin table and magnets on the head of each pin.  It had a pit similar to the AMF and an elevator similar to the GSX.  Pin loading involves the combination of a carousel and magazine.  The company claimed this technology reduces stops in play due to table jams on out-of-range pins.  Mendes was bought out by Qubica, which sold the machine as the MAG3 until its partnership with AMF.

The now-defunct [[Bowl Mor]] firm of central Massachusetts (no relation to [[Bowlmor AMF]]) that was more famous for their candlepin pinsetters, also made tenpin pinspotters early in their history.  Some of these units are still in service, with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDNUsBFvyW4 at least one bowling center in Japan] having continued to use them, with some design features [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jii6U6fhAZc similar to the Brunswick Model A units] in appearance and function.

==Candlepin pinsetters==
The most common [[candlepin]] pinsetters were made by a Massachusetts company named Bowl-Mor (no relation to [[Bowlero Corporation|Bowlmor AMF]]), which was founded in the 1940s by two [[Lawyer|attorneys]], Howard Dowd and R. Lionel Barrows. According to the International Candlepin Bowling Association (ICBA), Dowd and Barrows were searching for business venture that could weather an [[economic depression]]. Marketing research on their part found that participant sports met this requirement, and that bowling was one of the top three participant sports at the time. The first Bowl-Mor pinsetters &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=DI9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Bowl-Mor&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Bowl-Mor&amp;f=false Patent for the Bowl-Mor candlepin machine]&lt;/ref&gt; were installed at the now-defunct [[Whalom Park]] amusement park in 1949. Though no longer manufactured, refurbished units, parts and maintenance support are available from several vendors.

Bowl-Mor pinsetters have a depressed pit approximately 14" long at the end of the bowling lane, placed about 4" below the level of the lane surface, with a curtain behind it, hanging past the lane surface but not touching the bottom of the pit. The curtain arrests the backwards motion of struck balls and pins, so that they fall onto the pit. When a reset takes place, a "board-like" sweep bar descends, driven by a chain drive system on each side of the machine along a pair of "L"-shaped tracks — one on either side, and sweeps the pins and balls off the lane, through the depressed area, and past the curtain and onto a [[rotating]] turntable. Here, pins and balls separate, being spun off the steadily rotating turntable by centrifugal force into the elevators.

An elevator composed of a rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards the top of the machine, and then turns 90 degrees to bring the pins horizontally across, bringing the pins past ten conveyors each wide enough to hold pins in a lengthwise orientation. Unlike the pinspotters used for tenpins and duckpins, since candlepins have identical "ends" to them, the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in one particular direction.  The pins fall off the end of the conveyors into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms the main part of the spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward end of its travel, and then begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the end of the lanebed, and release a set of pins, and then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins once more.

A separate elevator next to the turntable transports the balls to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen "dead wood" pins to ''remain'' on the lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for "spotting cells" in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by [[Roller chain|chains]] – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks on either side of the unit – or [[belt (mechanical)|belts]]. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate {{convert|1450|lb}}, and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000.

AMF manufactured candlepin pinsetters for a short time in the 1960s, using a Bowl-Mor style spotting table and an adapted tenpin-style sweep bar that operated [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHV1Me7RP8c at an unusually rapid pace] during its sweep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=kR1sAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=American+Machine+%26+Foundry+pinspotter&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2# Patent for the AMF candlepin machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless triggered into action by an automated scoring unit, candlepin pinsetters must be started by the bowler at the conclusion of a frame, by using a button or foot pedal operated switch to start the reset cycle.

==Five-pin pinsetters==
[[Five-pin bowling]] is a popular variation in Canada, and pinsetters fall into two categories:  string and free-fall.  String pinsetters are more prevalent, and consist of machines attached to the head of each pin, by means of a cord.  Essentially, the pinsetter is triggered by the movement of any pin by more than an inch or two.  With that, the machine lowers a guard, pulls up all 5 pins, and resets those that did not move.  There is, on average, a three-second lag from when the pins were knocked down to when the guard is lowered.  The pit floor is angled such that the ball is gravity-fed to a track that leads to an elevator.  The elevator lifts the ball to the return track.

Free-fall 5-pin pinsetters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iCe3hfheQI work in a similar way] to their ten-pin counterparts, and requires initiation by the bowler pressing a "reset" button as a candlepin unit does to "cycle" it, when a ball is bowled or pin knocked down.  When the player pushes their "Reset" button, the machine lowers a guard, lifts standing pins and sweeps away the downed pins.  If it does not recognize any standing pins, it will set up a new set for the next frame.  Unlike tenpin, balls and pins are picked up in the same elevator or conveyor and are separated at the top of the machine.

==Duckpin pinsetters==
[[Duckpin bowling]] is played in two varieties.

Regular duckpin bowling is popular in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States.  One popular pinspotter in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was produced from 1953-1973. It has continuously moving conveyor belts at the ends of the gutters beside the pin deck as required by the sport's ruling body, the National Duckpin Bowling Congress&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndbc.org/ NDBC's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; that move fallen pins to the pit.  The Sherman's sweep device is located on the right side, vertical "kickback" panel of the lane and pivots 180 degrees (much like a fence gate) to clear pins.  The pin table always handles the pins by the neck.  A new rack of pins is created with a moving magazine that is shaped like a pin triangle.  When the magazine is loaded and the bowler is ready for a new set of pins, a lever pushes the magazine unit out to the pin table so it can take the pins out of the magazine and then set them down on the lane.

The Bowl-Mor company also made a duckpin pinspotter for a time, using a similar sweep device to its more famous candlepin machines.

Soft belly or rubberband duckpin is played in Quebec.  Most of these bowling centers use a string type pinsetter similar to five pin.  Apart from five-pin, rubber band duckpin is the only bowling variant that currently sanctions string type pinsetters.  The free-fall machine for this sport features a rotating turntable in the pit floor similar to a Bowl-Mor candlepin unit, conveyor belts in the gutters as required in the regular duckpin game in the US, an elevator similar to the Brunswick GSX, a turret similar to the A-2, and a rather flat looking pin table.  The sweep is similar to the candlepin Bowl-Mor.

==Off-spot pins==
Older table-based pinsetters that pick up the pins between throws could malfunction if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.

If a pin had drifted but still managed to be picked up, older table pinsetters would simply realign the pin into the correct spot when placing it back onto the lane. This results in less than accurate gameplay since the table is changing the pin positions during the pickup process.

Regular table-style fully automated tenpin pinspotters from AMF and Brunswick, from their beginnings earlier in the 20th century, have been required by the [[United States Bowling Congress]] to be able to accurately re-spot "off-spot" pins that have been knocked out of position, sometimes up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm from the normal setting position, and then place them back onto the lane in the same location. If the pins are sufficiently out of position to not be pickable, the table will detect contact with the misplaced pin, and shut down the pinspotter to prevent mechanism damage.

String pinsetters generally do not have a mechanism to place pins back on the lane exactly where they were before, during the spare clearing.  Since there is no table, collision damage is not possible with a string pinsetter, but they can suffer from string entanglement when the pins are being picked up, that prevents pins from aligning with the pickup holes.

The '''scrum cap''' is a form of headgear used by [[Rugby football|rugby]] players to protect the ears in the [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]], which can otherwise suffer injuries leading to the condition commonly known as [[cauliflower ears]]. Although originally designed for forwards they are now worn by players of all positions, even those who don't play in the scrum. A prominent back to wear a scrum cap is [[Leigh Halfpenny]] who removes his to kick for goal.

A simpler alternative to a cap, or a head-cap and used by many players, is a thin strip of foam or cloth and electrical tape wrapped around the ears like a head band.

==Construction==
The scrum cap was first used by the [[Christ's College Finchley]]'s 1st XV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/the_game/history/christ_college_finchley] https://firepowersport.com/history-of-scrum-caps/&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|February 2010|date=July 2010}} and Eurig Evans is credited with its design. The traditional scrum cap was constructed of a thin cloth helmet with padding over the ears, held in place by a strap&amp;mdash;but modern models are typically made from thin foam.

The headgear is defined by Regulation 12&lt;ref name=REG12&gt;[http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/060924gfirbregulation12_879.pdf "REGULATION 12.	PROVISIONS RELATING TO PLAYERS’ DRESS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124225026/http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/060924gfirbregulation12_879.pdf |date=2011-01-24 }}, IRB&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] as being made of soft, thin materials. Stiff materials, such as plastics, are forbidden, and buckles are not permitted. Regulation 12[2] also gives details regarding the testing standards for this headgear. All headgear to be worn in rugby union must carry an IRB approval logo.

==Concussive protection==
Since the early 1990s, other players have taken to wearing padded headgear. This is intended to protect from cuts and head injuries that can occur from incidental contact in [[Playing_rugby_union#Tackle|tackles]] or at [[Playing_rugby_union#Ruck|rucks]]. Whilst they may prevent some cuts and abrasions, such headgear has not been shown to reduce concussive injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=306–13 |doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181864bee |title=Does Padded Headgear Prevent Head Injury in Rugby Union Football? |year=2009 |last1=McIntosh |first1=Andrew S. |last2=McCrory |first2=Paul |last3=Finch |first3=Caroline F. |last4=Best |first4=John P. |last5=Chalmers |first5=David J. |last6=Wolfe |first6=Rory |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |volume=41 |issue=2 |pmid=19127196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
[[World Rugby]] has not made scrum caps compulsory, and many players and officials are divided over their utility. England captain [[Mike Tindall]] criticised their usage by youth players, saying that they had a detrimental result on tackling ability from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/11428192/Mike-Tindall-get-rid-of-protective-gear-for-rugby-kids.html&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh player [[Jonathan Davies (rugby, born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] similarly felt that they should not be compulsory, as injuries were part of the game.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/32212636&lt;/ref&gt;. High profile referee [[Nigel Owens]] has however suggested making the wearing of headgear compulsory for all players.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/32212636&lt;/ref&gt;, and they are mandatory for all players in Japanese youth teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100419-211116.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2136">In [[sports]], '''shirts versus skins''' (or '''shirts and skins''') is a common form of denoting [[team]] affiliations in a [[pick-up game]]; typically, when played by [[males]] on a public [[Pitch (sports field)|court or field]], such as in a [[urban park|city park]] or [[playground|schoolyard]]. The practice involves the members of one team wearing [[shirts]] while the ones of the other team don't. This is used in the absence of [[Uniform#Sports|uniforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duchak |first=Alicia |title=A-Z of Modern America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJROBoIamOAC&amp;pg=PA280 |accessdate=2008-08-09 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-18756-7 |pages=280–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Something Like the Gods: A Cultural History of the Athlete from Achilles to LeBron |author=Stephen Amidon |publisher=Rodale |year=2012 |isbn=9781609611248 |pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
This simple form of recognition is a regular sight in [[streetball]], [[street football]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and other pick-up games. The identification by manner of dress negates the need to remember the division of players among friends, or to learn the faces of strangers in a pick-up game. An alternative to the shirts‐skins system when females are present is the use of [[scrimmage vest|pinnies]]. However, this requires one or more of the participants, or an organiser, to provide the pinnies.

The system is most frequently applied to male participants, due to [[Modesty#Generally accepted Western norms|female toplessness taboos]]. In [[:wiktionary:co-ed#Adjective|coed]] shirts/skins games where these taboos are observed, female players more often align exclusively as 'shirts' (for example, 3 females and 9 males, at a pickup basketball court, would team as 6 male 'skins' versus 3 male and 3 female 'shirts'.) Alternatively, or at greater female-to-male ratios, female players in [[Scrimmage vest|pinnies]] can be recognised by teammates and opponents as 'skins'.

The '''[[European Union]]''' plays a minor and mostly indirect policy role in '''sport''', because (a) sport is normally considered to be outside the [[principle of conferral|competences conferred]] by the member states to the European Union and (b) sport is in general organised  internally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally.

==Role of the EU==
=== Direct ===

The European Union has a very limited direct role in sport. The [[European Commission]] is composed of Directorates-General and several departments. Within the [[Directorate-General]] Education and Culture, is the Sport Unit, which is responsible for the following main areas:
* cooperation within the Commission and with other institutions on sport-related issues,
* cooperation with national and international sports institutions, organisations and federations,
* bilateral meetings with sports institutions and organisations and international sports federations. [http://ec.europa.eu/sport/index_en.htm]

One of the few specific measures in Sports was taken by Decision No. 291/2003/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 6 February 2003 that established the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.

The activities and initiatives undertaken during 2004 were organised at Community, transnational, national, regional and local level, and was sometimes co-financed by the Community. Activities compromised for instance financial support for transnational, national, regional or local initiatives to promote education through sport. [http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l35008.htm]

===Indirect===
Although not directed specifically at sport, many of the rules, policies and programmes of the European Union affect the sports world or are of interest to it.

In particular, the [[common market]] of the European Union creates the right for any EU citizen to move and work freely in another member state.  The landmark [[Bosman ruling]] confirmed that this right, when applied to professional athletes, forbids nationality quotas in sports leagues that affect EU citizens.  This has changed the face of professional sports in the EU, with top teams now collecting talent from all over Europe, and sometimes even fielding teams with no domestic players at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">A '''sports chaplain''' provides [[pastoral care]] for the [[sportsperson|sports person]] and the broader [[sports]] community including the [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, administrators and their families.

[[Chaplain]]s to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 a congress held in [[Hong Kong]] on sports [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the sub-continent and [[Australasia]]. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains.   

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration.  Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport.  This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

There were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
The USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as [[Athletes in Action]] and [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] also provide chaplains to various sports at the [[college athletics|collegiate]] and [[professional sports|professional]] levels.  Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation.  Every [[MLB]], [[NFL]], [[NBA]] &amp; [[Major League Soccer]] franchise has a chaplain.  Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams.  In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip.  This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. 

In recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. 

In addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.

== United Kingdom ==
Sports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the [[Baptist Union of Great Britain]] to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Called Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportschaplaincy.org.uk/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/19465215&lt;/ref&gt; chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in [[association football|football]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[cricket]] and [[horseracing]].  They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the [[London2012]]  [[Olympics]].  All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.

== Australia ==
As a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by [[Mark Tronson]], the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete [[respite care|respite]]. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). 

As a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in [[Australia]] adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as [[cricket]], [[motor racing]], [[tennis]], [[rugby league]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[golf]], [[yachting]], [[skiing]], [[netball]], [[rodeo]] and [[horse racing]], the [[Australian Institute of Sport]], and State Institutes of Sport.

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Sports journalism''' is a form of [[writing]] that reports on [[sport]]ing topics and [[sports competition|competitions]]. 

Sports [[journalism]] is the essential element of many [[news media]] organizations. While the sports department (along with [[Entertainment journalism|entertainment news]]) within some [[newspaper]]s has been mockingly called the ''toy department'', because sports [[journalist]]s do not concern themselves with the 'serious' topics covered by the news desk, sports coverage has grown in importance as sport has grown in [[wealth]], [[Economic power|power]], and [[Social influence|influence]].

Also, some media organizations are devoted entirely to sports [[Journalism|reporting]] — newspapers and [[magazine]]s such as ''[[L'Equipe]]'' in [[France]], ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in [[Italy]], ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' in [[Spain]], the defunct ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' in Britain, and American ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Sporting News]]''; [[television network]]s such as ''[[Eurosport]]'', ''[[Fox Sports]]'', ''[[ESPN]]''; [[sports radio]] stations such as ''[[BBC Radio 5 Live]]'', ''[[ESPN Radio]]'', ''[[Fox Sports Radio]]'' and ''[[TSN Radio]]''; and ''[[The Sports Network|The Sports Network (TSN)]]''; and websites such as [[ESPN.com]], [[Foxsports.com]], and [[Yahoo! Sports]].

== Socio-political significance ==
[[Major League Baseball]] gave print journalists a special role in its games. They were named [[official scorer]]s and kept statistics that were considered part of the official record of league.  Active sportswriters were removed from this role in 1980.  Although their statistical judgment calls could not affect the outcome of a game in progress, the awarding of errors and wins/saves were seen as powerful influences on pitching staff selections and play lists when coach decisions seemed unusual.  The removal of writers, who could benefit fiscally from sensational sports stories, was done to remove this perception of a [[conflict of interest]], and to increase statistics volume, consistency, and accuracy.

Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: [[Jackie Robinson]] breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of [[anabolic steroids]] and other, banned [[performance-enhancing drugs]], and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for [[Olympic Games]], also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages.

Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team.

== In Europe ==
The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports – such as association football, [[cricket]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] – were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today.&lt;!-- Reference?  --&gt;

Andrew Warwick has suggested that [[The Boat Race]] provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'',  page 213, [[University of Chicago Press]]  {{ISBN|0-226-87374-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Race, an annual [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] event between the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], has been held annually from 1856.

[[Cricket]], possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'', in the first half of the 20th century, employed [[Neville Cardus]] as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, [[John Arlott]], who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the [[BBC]], was also known for his poetry.

The first [[1908 Summer Olympics|London Olympic Games]] in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' even had Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] at the [[White City Stadium]] to cover the finish of the [[Marathon]].

Such was the drama of that race, in which [[Dorando Pietri]] collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by [[Queen Alexandra]]. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the [[1908 Olympic Marathon]], and the official length of the event worldwide to this day.

The London race, called the [[Polytechnic Marathon]] and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at [[Windsor Castle]] to White City, was first sponsored by the ''Sporting Life'', which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the [[Second World War]].

The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer [[Edgar Wallace]], who made a report on [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] on June 6, 1923 for the [[British Broadcasting Company]].

In France, ''[[L'Auto]]'', the predecessor of ''L'Equipe'', had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The [[Tour de France]] was born, and sports journalism's role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which ''L'Auto'' was published (in Italy, the [[Giro d'Italia]] established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, ''La Gazzetta'').

== Sports stars in the press box ==
After the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day's football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings.

Some newspapers, such as ''[[Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', with 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion [[Harold Abrahams]], or the London ''Evening News'' using former England cricket captain Sir [[Leonard Hutton]], began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards.

Many "ghosted" columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the [[Cricket Reporting Agency]], which routinely provided the editors of the [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]] cricket almanac, and Hayters.

Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The ''Daily Mirror'''s Peter Wilson, [[Hugh McIlvanney]], first at ''The Observer'' and lately at the ''Sunday Times'', [[Ian Wooldridge]] of the ''Daily Mail'' and soccer writer [[Brian Glanville]], best known at the ''Sunday Times'', and columnist Patrick Collins, of the ''Mail on Sunday'', five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award.

Many became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} of often earth-shattering events that have transcended the back pages and been reported on the front pages: the [[Munich massacre|Massacre at the Munich Olympics]] in 1972; [[Muhammad Ali]]'s fight career, including his 1974 title bout against [[George Foreman]]; the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel]] Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of [[Tiger Woods]], [[George Best]], [[David Beckham]], [[Lester Piggott]] and other high-profile stars.

McIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of [[IMG (company)|IMG]], the agency founded by the American businessman, [[Mark McCormack]], to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.

== Investigative journalism and sport ==
Since the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers.

[[Tom Bower]], with his 2003 sports book of the year ''Broken Dreams'', which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by [[Andrew Jennings]] and [[Vyv Simson]] with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson's ''The Lords of the Rings'' in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on [[FIFA]], the world football body.

Likewise, award-winning writers [[Duncan Mackay (journalist)|Duncan Mackay]], of ''The Guardian'', and [[Steven Downes]] unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, ''Running Scared'', which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, [[Cliff Temple]].

But the writing of such exposes - referred to as "spitting in the soup" by [[Paul Kimmage]], the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the ''Sunday Times'' – often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by "beat" correspondents.
 
The stakes can be high when upsetting sport's powers: in 2007, England's [[the Football Association|FA]] opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the [[FA Cup]] and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV.

==Sports books==

Increasingly, sports journalists have turned to [[Long-form journalism|long-form writing]], producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. [[Dan Topolski]] was the first recipient of the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.

== Organizations ==
Most countries have their own national [[Sports Journalists' Association|association of sports journalists]]. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism.

The International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world's biggest sports federations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], football's world governing body FIFA, and the [[IAAF]], the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives:
* to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members.
* to strengthen the friendship, solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries.
* to assure the best possible working conditions for the members.

For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers’ Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media.

In Britain, the Sports Journalists' Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry's "Oscars", sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers' Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers' Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. Its president is the veteran broadcaster and columnist [[Sir Michael Parkinson]]. The SJA represents the British sports media on the [[British Olympic Association]]'s press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members' interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, [[Martin Samuel]], then the chief football correspondent of ''The Times'', was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, [[Jeff Stelling]], of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the ''Sunday Times'''s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.

In the United States, the Indianapolis-based [[National Sports Journalism Center]] monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors, the largest group of sports media professionals in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In more recent years,{{When|date=May 2015}} sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services. This has become even more apparent with the increase in online social engagement. This has led to an increasing number of freelance journalism in the sports industry and an explosion of sports related news and industry websites.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Fanzines and blogs ==
Through the 1970s and '80s, a rise in "citizen journalism" in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer "fanzines" - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive.

Some authors, such as [[Jim Munro]], have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the [[West Ham United]] fanzine ''Fortune's Always Dreaming'', Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine ''When Saturday Comes'', have effectively gone mainstream.

The advent of the internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, [[Bleacher Report]], [[Deadspin.com]], ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, [http://www.massholesports.com Masshole Sports], the blogs in the [[Yardbarker]] Network, and others have garnered massive followings.

Blogging has also been taken up by former athletes such as [[Curt Schilling]], [[Paula Radcliffe]], [[Greg Oden]], [[Donovan McNabb]], and [[Chris Cooley (American football)|Chris Cooley]].

==Smartphones==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2015}}
Since the beginning of smartphones and the use of applications, sports media has taken off and has become accessible from almost anywhere at any time. Not only can fans check the scores on different apps such as ESPN and Global Sports Media, but people can use social media apps as well to find out different scores. These apps give score updates, rosters, game schedules, injury updates, and much more right when it happens. People can get real time results right from their phone. They do not need to be at the game, or right by their television, to see how their favorite team is doing. Now people can stream games right from their phone.

This type of fast, easy information is very important to sports fans. As stated in a Time magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/01/26/social-media-and-sports-natural-teammates/|title=Social Media and Sports: Natural Teammates|work=TIME.com|accessdate=21 May 2015|date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Enthusiastic fans are eager for updates on their favorite teams and the opportunity to rant about what went wrong in the playoffs or why their coach should be fired”. Many people want to discuss matters about sports, teams and games, and this article shows that with the sports apps, the news can be found at a moment’s notice.

Thanks to the smartphone, a fan no longer has to wait for scores or search the web for information on players. All the information is available at the palm of their hand. Sports apps do not always have to be about giving scores, as some applications include workout helpers, rule books, and even games. The workout apps can show how the professionals’ workout and can give inspiration to do the same workout. The rule books are important, because it spreads the knowledge about the game, and it can get people interested in new games. The games apps are a good way of teaching people how the game is played, and can give players a bigger interest in a specific sport. All of these different apps are a part of sports media in the form of using smartphones and apps. This helps spread information about sports to anyone who wants it.

Smartphones can not only be used just for scores, they can also help athletes become known and recruited. These days most everything is caught on camera, and that includes great plays made by athletes. Once a video is taken it will be spread through the social media sites in no time.

==Gender==

The number of women in the sports journalism industry is rapidly growing, and this has caused a lot of controversy in recent years. Many traditionalists believe that the sporting industry should be predominately for men, and female journalists have endured a lot of criticism for breaking the mold.

There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away.

Some breakthrough female reporters include [[Adeline Daley]] (whom some consider the "Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kipen|first=David|title=Fact: The Golden State is the epicenter of baseball, a mother lode of sun-ripened talent|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Fact-The-Golden-State-is-the-epicenter-of-2705387.php|accessdate=2014-05-20|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Anita Martini]], Tracy Dodds, [[Mary Garber]], [[Lesley Visser]] and [[Sally Jenkins]].

A '''sports visor'''—also called a '''sun visor''' or '''visor cap'''—is a type of crownless hat consisting simply of a [[visor]] or brim with a strap encircling the head. The top of the head is not covered and the visor protects only the face, including eyes, nose, and cheeks, from the sun.

The visor portion of a sun visor may be either curved or flat and the strap is often equipped with an adjustable  [[velcro]] fastener in back. The strap can function as a [[sweatband]] although usually not. This type of headgear was designed for use in outdoor sports (especially [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[softball]]) where eye protection from direct sunlight is desirable, but is now often used by non-athletes at beach and other sunny outdoor events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26199">A '''stadium subsidy''' is a type of government [[subsidy]] given to [[professional sports]] franchises to help finance the construction or renovation of a [[sports venue]].  Stadium subsidies can come in the form of tax-free [[municipal bonds]], cash payments, long-term tax exemptions, infrastructure improvements, and operating cost subsidies.  Funding for stadium subsidies can come from all levels of government and remains controversial among legislators and citizens.  There is an ongoing debate among economists and municipalities about the aggregate effects of hosting a professional athletic team. &lt;ref name="kianka2013a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawweb2009.law.villanova.edu/sportslaw/?p=1853|title=Subsidizing Billionaires: How Your Money is Being Used to Construct Professional Sports Stadiums|author=Kianka, Tim|date=6 March 2013|publisher=Jeffrey S.

==Background==

===In the United States===
Eighty years ago, stadium subsidies were essentially unheard of, with funding for professional sports stadiums coming from private sources. In 1951, [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] commissioner [[Ford Frick]] decided that league teams were bringing large amounts of revenue to their host cities from which owners weren't able to profit. He announced that cities would need to start supporting their teams by building and maintaining venues through public subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sports Economics|last=Fort|first=Rodney D.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011|isbn=9780136066026|location=Boston|pages=408, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most new or renovated professional sports stadiums are financed at least partly through stadium subsidies. While Frick may have been a catalyst, this change has been primarily caused by the increase in bargaining power of professional sports teams at the expense of their host cities.  As the years have passed, [[municipalities]] have come to love their local professional sports teams.  

Recently there have been many studies that have suggested that there are a number of direct and indirect economic benefits associated with hosting a professional sports team, although each city experiences this to a different degree.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baade|first=Robert A.|last2=Dye|first2=Richard F.|date=1990-04-01|title=The Impact of Stadium and Professional Sports on Metropolitan Area Development|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2257.1990.tb00513.x/abstract|journal=Growth and Change|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1990.tb00513.x|issn=1468-2257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Dennis|date=2007-10-01|title=Stadiums and Arenas: Economic Development or Economic Redistribution?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00073.x/abstract|journal=Contemporary Economic Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=565–577|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00073.x|issn=1465-7287}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even still, a survey conducted in 2017 found that "83% of economists polled believed that a subsidy's cost to the public outweighed the economic benefits".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolla|first=Scott|date=May 2017|title=The Economics of Subsidizing Sports Stadiums|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sports-jobs-taxes-are-new-stadiums-worth-the-cost/|journal=Page One Economics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/sports-stadiums|title=Sports Stadiums|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2017|website=IMG Forum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economics behind issuing billions of dollars to professional athletic organizations are still unclear, but cities have clearly showed that they are willing to assume the best, as recent years have seen an increase in the number of subsidies issues and the amount of money issued per subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadspin.com/the-raiders-robbed-las-vegas-in-americas-worst-stadium-1795475973|title=The Raiders Robbed Las Vegas In America's Worst Stadium Deal|last=Brown|first=T.M.|work=Deadspin|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/falcons-new-home-is-just-the-latest-of-handouts-to-the-nfl/article/2633548|title=Falcons' new home is just the latest of handouts to the NFL|last=Kampis|first=Johnny|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Judith Grant|date=May 1, 2005|title=The Real Cost of Funding for Major League Sports Facilities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527002504264614#articleCitationDownloadContainer|journal=Journal of Sports Economics|volume=6|pages=|via=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-seven of the 30 stadiums built between 1953 and 1970 received more than $450 million in total public funding for construction.&lt;ref&gt;Okner, B. “Subsidies of Stadiums and Arenas,” in ''Government and the Sports Business'', edited by R. G.Noll. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 1974, 325–48.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, publicly funding a stadium grew in popularity as an effective incentive to attract professional sports teams to up and coming cities.  Famous examples include the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] leaving New York in exchange for [[Dodger Stadium|300 acres in Chavez Ravine]] and the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] moving to San Francisco for what would eventually become [[Candlestick Park]].&lt;ref name="phelps"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1178&amp;context=jcred | title=Stadium Construction for Professional Sports: Reversing the Inequities Through Tax Incentives | author=Phelps, Zachary A. | journal=Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development | year=2004 | volume=18 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles Coliseum became the first fully publicly funded stadium in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.usc.edu/135433/usc-kicks-off-270-million-renovation-of-coliseum/|title=USC kicks off $270 million renovation of Coliseum - USC News|website=news.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, a market for subsidies has come into existence.  Sports teams have realized their ability to relocate at lower and lower costs to their private contributors.  Because local governments feel that keeping their sports teams around is critical to the success of their cities, they comply and grant teams subsidies. This creates a market for subsidies, where professional athletic organizations can shop between cities to see which municipality will provide them with the most resources.  Teams in the NFL have a major incentive to keep their stadium up to date, as the NFL allows teams to bid to host the Super Bowl and takes recent and planned renovations into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjDiwwaN5VsC&amp;pg=PA1509#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Sports Management and Marketing|last=Swayne|first=Linda E.|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412973823|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2003-09-22-ny-nj-superbowl_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - N.Y./N.J.

=== In Europe ===
Public subsidies for major league sports stadiums and arenas are far less common in Europe than in the United States. The relationship between the local clubs and the cities that host them is typically much stronger than in the United States, with the team being more intrinsic to the cities' identity. Cities would be significantly more upset at the departure of their beloved local teams, and viable alternative cities already have their own clubs to whom their residents are loyal. As a result, the leagues in Europe have significantly less bargaining power. They will not threaten to relocate to another city if not provided with a subsidy, or at the very least the threat would not be credible&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26160156|title=Sport, space, and the city|last=John.|first=Bale,|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415080983|location=London|oclc=26160156}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also worth noting that the NFL, the league in the United States whose stadiums have the highest percentage of public financing of the four major leagues, does not have an equivalent in Europe; American football is relatively unpopular.

==Types of Subsidies==
There are two primary ways that a city facilitates the construction of a stadium.  The first, and most commonly used method, is a direct subsidy.  This involves a city promising a certain amount of revenue to go towards the construction, maintenance, and renovation of a stadium.  Other times, the city will give tax breaks to teams or stadium owners in lieu of a direct cash transfer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Over a period of time, a reduction in the taxes paid against the stadium generally saves the organization building the stadium around the same amount as a subsidy would be worth.  

In the USA, the annual subsidies provided by the state for the construction of stadiums are in the range of billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/companies/nfl-taxpayers/|title=NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers|author=Isidore, Chris|date=2015-01-30|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/12/06/football-a-waste-of-taxpayers-money/|title=Football: A Waste of Taxpayers’ Money|author=Gillespie, Nick|date=2013-12-06|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2005 study of all sports stadiums and facilities in use by the four major leagues from 1990 to 2001 calculated a total public subsidy of approximately $17 billion, or approx. $24 billion in 2018 dollars. The average annual subsidy during that period was $1.6 billion ($2.2 billion in 2018) for all 99 facilities included in the study, with an average of $16.2 million ($22.8 million in 2018) per facility annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Judith Grant|date=May 1, 2005|title=Full Count: The Real Cost of Public Funding For Major League Sports Facilities|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1527002504264614|journal=Journal Of Sports Economics|volume=6|pages=119-143|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 Bloomberg analysis estimates that tax exemptions annually cost the [[U.S. Treasury]] $146 million.&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

==Benefits==
In granting stadium subsidies, governments claim that the new or improved stadiums will have positive [[Externality|enternalities]] for the city.  Proponents tout improvements to the local economy as the primary benefits.  Economists who debate the issue have separated the effects on a local economy into direct and indirect effects.  Direct benefits are those that exist as a result of the "rent, concessions, parking, advertising, suite rental, and other preferred seating rental", and direct expenses come from "wages and related expenses, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance," and the costs of building the facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   Generally, these benefits vary widely.  The [[Baltimore Orioles|Balitmore Orioles]], for example, estimate that each game they host brings $3 million in economic benefits to the city.  Over the course of an entire baseball season, the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] will have 81 home games, which means that benefit gets multiplied to be around $243 million a season.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sports-jobs-taxes-are-new-stadiums-worth-the-cost/|title=Sports, Jobs, &amp; Taxes: Are New Stadiums Worth the Cost?|last=Noll|first=Andrew Zimbalist and Roger G.|date=|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[NFL]] teams the case is much different, as there are only 8 home games a season.  Over the lifetime of a stadium, which is often between 20-30 years, this benefit accumulates even more.  Essentially, this is the basis on which municipalities evaluate the benefit of a team.  [[File:Stadium economics public economics.png|thumb|395x395px|Visual Representation of the Social Marginal Benefit Calculation]]Supporters further argue that the stadiums attract tourism and businesses that lead to further spending and job creation, representing indirect benefits.  All of the increased spending causes a [[Local multiplier effect|multiplier effect]] that leads to more spending and job creation and eventually finances the subsidy through increased tax revenues from ticket and concessions sales, improved property values and more spending nearby the stadium.&lt;ref name="brookings1997"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimbalist|first1=Andrew|last2=Noll|first2=Roger G|title=Sports, Jobs, &amp; Taxes: Are New Stadiums Worth the Cost?|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1997/06/summer-taxes-noll|website=Brookings Institution|publisher=The Brookings Institution|accessdate=17 February 2016|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, there has even been an observed reduction in crime during a game, although the aggregate effect of professional sports on crime is disputable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laqueur|first=Hannah|last2=Copus|first2=Ryan|date=2014-04-25|title=Entertainment as Crime Prevention: Evidence from Chicago Sports Games|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2429551|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, G. F., Katz, J., &amp; Scarborough, K. E. (1992). The impact of professional football games upon violent assaults on women. ''Violence and Victims, 7''(2), 157-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there has recently been research that suggests that home games generate what is called a "sunny day benefit".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rappaport, J., &amp; Wilkerson, C. (2001). What are the benefits of hosting a major league sports franchise? ''Economic Review - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, 86''(1), 55-86. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ccl.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/218422373?accountid=10141&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a measurable drop in local spending that occurs within a city on a rainy day, but with a professional sports team playing a game, spending increases significantly.  Jordan Rappaport, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, estimates that this benefit is between $14 to $24 million dollars a year, which can be compounded over the life of a stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Rappaport &amp; Chad R. Wilkerson, 2001. "[https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedker/y2001iqip55-86nv.86no.1.html What are the benefits of hosting a major league sports franchise?,]" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, issue Q I, pages 55-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for stadium subsidies also claim less quantifiable [[positive externalities]], such as civic pride and [[Fan (person)|fan identification]], so that hosting a major sports team becomes something of a [[public good]].  Local sports fans enjoy the benefit even if they do not pay for it.&lt;ref name="brookings1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cas.unt.edu/~jhauge/teaching/sports/owen.pdf | title=The Intangible Benefits of Sports Teams | author=Owen, Jeffrey G. | journal=Public Finance and Management | year=2006 | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=321–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a city conducts a calculation to assess what they are willing to pay for a [[subsidy]], they use an economic model that attempts to quantify the various social benefits for each dollar invested.  This is done through a social [[marginal benefit]] evaluation, which takes the sums of all of the private benefits that result from investing, intended or not.   Economists consider all the economic effects of having a professional athletic team in a city, like the "sunny day" benefit, job creation, civic pride, increased tourism, decreases/increases in crime rates, etc.  The social [[marginal cost]] is equal to the sum of the private [[Marginal benefit|marginal benefits]].  The [[marginal cost]] is known only by the government, who deliberates with franchises to decide how much bringing a team to their city will cost.  The image to the right is a good visual representation of this analysis.  In this diagram, the city would like to acquire four teams, since at that point the social [[marginal benefit]] of recruiting a team still exceeds the [[marginal cost]].

==Criticisms==
[[File:Social marginal cost graph1.png|thumb|396x396px|Visual Representation of the Social Marginal Cost]]
Many criticisms exist regarding the use of stadium subsidies.  First, critics argue that new stadiums generate little to no new spending ([[consumption (economics)|consumption]]).  Instead, what fans spend in and around the stadium are substitutes for what they would otherwise spend on different entertainment options.  Thus, this argument contends, new stadiums do not cause economic growth or lead to increased aggregate income.  In fact, this suggests that money being substituted towards concessions, tickets, and merchandise actively harms the economy surrounding a stadium.&lt;ref name="fed2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.stlouisfed.org/Publications/Regional-Economist/April-2001/Should-Cities-Pay-for-Sports-Facilities | title=Should Cities Pay for Sports Facilities? | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis | work=The Regional Economist | date=2001-04-01 | accessdate=2016-02-02 | author=Zaretsky, Adam M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another criticism of stadium subsidies is that much of the money the new stadiums bring in does not stay in the local economy.  Instead of going to stadium employees and other sources that would benefit the local community, a lot of the money goes toward paying the organizations.&lt;ref name="fed2001" /&gt;  Those payments come from either the state or city government, where spending normally goes towards social welfare programs or salaries for government employees.  It has been argued that the [[opportunity cost]] of a subsidy for a sports team is far greater than the benefit, since the billions of dollars that are spent on a stadium could be better spent on schools, firehouses, public transportation, or police departments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kianka2013a" /&gt;  

Critics also argue that the construction of new stadiums could cause citizens and businesses to leave a city because of [[eminent domain]] issues.  If a city is forced to take land from its citizens to build a new stadium, those who have lost land could become angry enough to leave the city.  If they are business owners, then they will likely take their businesses with them.  These trade-offs are a part of the [[marginal cost]] calculation the city does.  Much like the social [[marginal benefit]] calculation the city performed to find what benefits teams brought to the city, the social [[marginal cost]] calculation sums up all of the unintended negative effects from a particular spending plan.

A review of the empirical literature assessing the effects of subsidies for professional sports franchises and facilities reveals that most evidence goes against sports subsidies.  Specifically, subsidies cannot be  justified on the grounds of local economic development, income growth or job creation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="owen" /&gt;

The '''Tennis Girl''' is a British [[poster]] that has become a [[pop icon]].&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Fergus|title=70s poster icon is back, so anyone for Tennis Girl?|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=18 January 2011|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1052912007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102055726/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1052912007|archivedate=2 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows a young woman from behind walking towards the net of a [[tennis court]] with a [[tennis racquet]] in her right hand and her left hand reaching behind lifting her short tennis dress, showing she is [[going commando|not wearing any underwear]].

==History==
The image was first published as part of a calendar by [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]] for the 1977 [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the same year [[Virginia Wade]] achieved the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] ladies' singles title.&lt;ref name="mercury"&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031064332/http://www.sundaymercury.net/lifestyle-news/tm_objectid%3D17216626%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50002%26headline%3Dserial-killer-s-deucey-poster-name_page.html|archivedate=31 October 2010|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/features/tm_objectid=17216626&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50002&amp;headline=serial-killer-s-deucey-poster-name_page.html|publisher=[[Sunday Mercury]]|first=Adam|last=Aspinall|deadurl=yes|title=Serial killer's deucey poster|date=11 June 2006|accessdate=20 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]] then negotiated a licence to distribute the image as a poster,&lt;ref name="mercury" /&gt; where from 1978 it achieved widespread distribution, selling over 2 million copies at £2 per poster.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; Although Athena went into [[Receivership#United Kingdom process|administration]] in 1995, the picture remains a popular  print to buy and can be found at other retailers like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], AllPosters &amp; [[King and McGaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/kivells/catalogue-id-kivell10034/lot-ea7589ed-c75f-4a3b-be23-a5be00908cc0|title=1987 Athena Tennis girl poster signed Martin Elliot|first=|last=the-saleroom.com|website=www.the-saleroom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler, who broke up with Elliot three years later, said in retrospect that she was not embarrassed about posing, nor bitter that she did not receive any royalties from the photo.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iconic-photos"/&gt; Butler (now Walker) is a mother of three, who works as a freelance illustrator in [[Droitwich Spa]], Worcestershire.&lt;ref name=BBC12833580/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28036668/&gt; Elliott died on 24 March 2010.&lt;ref name="bbc news"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8600863.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=2 April 2010|title=Tennis Girl poster photographer dies|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knotts, now a [[barrister]] living in [[Gloucestershire]], put the dress and racquet up for sale at an auction on 5 July 2014, the day of the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles]] final.&lt;ref name=BBC28036668&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-28036668|title=Athena Tennis Girl poster dress up for auction|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=26 June 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dress was sold for £15,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/06/25/so-you-can-now-buy-that-athena-tennis-poster-dress-4775334/|title=So you can now buy THAT Athena tennis poster dress|date=25 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stourbridgenews.co.uk/news/11300205.Tennis_Girl_dress_to_go_up_for_sale_in_Stourbridge/|title=Tennis Girl dress to go up for sale in Stourbridge|website=Stourbridge News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/486968/Athena-tennis-girl-dress-sells-for-15-000|title=Iconic cheeky 'tennis girl' dress sells for £15,000|first=Jane|last=Mathews|date=5 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/world/dress-from-cheeky-tennis-girl-poster-to-be-auctioned-634472.html|title=Dress from 'cheeky' Tennis Girl poster to be auctioned|date=25 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the racquet went for between £1000-£2000.

===Subject doubts===
In February 2015, Peter Atkinson from Marsh Gate, Cornwall, came forward to insist the photo was actually of his ex-wife, producing in evidence two items, one showing the same image and the other a close variant (seemingly taken on the same occasion), both of which were dated 1974, two years before Fiona Butler's photo shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2967415/Is-real-Athena-poster-girl-Pensioner-claims-cheeky-Tennis-Girl-model-fact-ex-wife-finally-evidence-prove-it.html |first=Damien |last=Gayle |title=Is this the real Athena poster girl?

==Parody==
Over the years the picture has been parodied by various people as diverse as former tennis star [[Pat Cash]], comedian [[Alan Carr]] and singer [[Kylie Minogue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoxtonradio.com/wimbledon-goes-east/|title=Wimbledon Goes East - Hoxton Radio|date=3 July 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with actor [[Keith Lemon]] featuring his parody in his 2012 calendar.&lt;ref name="iconic-photos"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Tennis Girl|publisher=Iconic Photos|accessdate=20 November 2012|date=2 April 2010|author=aalholmes|url=http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/the-tennis-girl/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also imitated in an advertisement for a tennis video game called [[Davis Cup World Tour]] for the [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis / Mega Drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Take advantage with Sony!|publisher=Game Dummy|accessdate=18 January 2011|url=http://www.gamedummy.com/2010/07/take-advantage-with-sega/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an election promise for the [[Belgian provincial and municipal elections, 2012|2012 Belgian elections]], a 22-year-old [[Belgium|Belgian]] woman from [[Sint-Truiden]] promised to publish a nude photo shoot when receiving 1,000 votes. She released a picture of her in the Tennis Girl pose prior to the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Truiense gaat toch niet naakt voor 1.000 stemmen|trans-title=Sint-Truiden're not naked for 1,000 votes|publisher=[[De Standaard]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=20 November 2012|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20120920_068|date=20 September 2012|author=bbd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 it was also parodied in the exit scene from episode 12 from the sixth series of ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]'' when [[List of Shameless characters#Minor recurring Characters|Lillian Tyler]], a character played by [[Alice Barry]], gets up and walks towards the door after winning a game console version of tennis.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

On 9 May 2016 it was displayed by [[Mark Hamill]] on Twitter from his @HamillHimself account as Princess Leia walking toward Tatooine buildings with a blaster in her hand instead of a tennis racquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=HamillHimself |number=729812090366640130 |date=9 May 2016 |title=I always knew-Here's PROOFof George's claimTHERE IS NO UNDERWEAR IN SPACE! #CheekyPrincess #TwiceTheBuns #OoLaLaLeia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Superstar Effect''' or "Tiger Woods effect" refers to the change in performance caused by the presence of a highly ranked player - a [[superstar]] - in a rank-order competition.

== Overview ==
The phenomenon was first described in a study titled "''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''"&lt;ref name="Brown1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jennifer|title=Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=October 2011|volume=119|issue=5|pages=982–1013|doi=10.1086/663306|jstor=663306}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Jennifer Brown, which examined the performance of golfers at events with and without [[Tiger Woods]]. In contradiction to what intuition would suggest (namely that increased rivalry encourages better performance), Brown finds that the presence of a superstar is in fact associated with reduced competitor’s efforts in rank-order tournaments. The explanation she provides is an economic model in which competing is costly - one might hurt themselves, for instance - thus when the chance of winning is very low, the participant is discouraged from performing to her best abilities as it is not worthwhile.

The study uses data from the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|Professional Golfers' Association]] (PGA) that contains round-by-round scores for all players in every tournament from 1999 to 2006 and hole-by-hole results for all events from 2002 to 2006. During this period, golfer Tiger Woods was performing significantly better than any other player with scores in regular and major events being lower than the group mean in all years except 2004.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; His consistent and dominant performance has earned him the title of superstar. Hence, the data is filtered creating a subset of tournaments Tiger Woods was a part of and other players’ performance is compared to when they are competing against Woods to when they are not. The analysis yields that on events when the highly skilled golfers were competing against Tiger Woods, their performance was considerably worse - with scores almost one [[stroke play|stroke]] higher on average - than on events where Tiger Woods was absent. On the other hand, lower-ranked golfers are less or not at all affected by his presence. Brown notes that this could be due to the fact that the stakes are not as high for lower-ranked golfers to start with.

Brown investigates the possibility of other explanations as to why golfers’ performance is poorer but finds that it is neither due to players taking more risks nor is the other players’ performance worse relative to Woods’ due to the fact that better golfers avoid competitions the superstar would be their opponent in. She also disperses the idea that it would be the increased media attention attributed to Woods’ presence that causes other players to produce lower results.

Finally, Brown notes that superstars must in fact be in their ‘super’ stage of career to be able to create an adverse effect: in periods where Tiger Woods was not that successful (in years 2003-2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diaz|first1=Jaime|title=The Truth About Tiger|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/features/index.ssf?%2Ffeatures%2Fgd200501tigerdiaz1.html|website=GolfDigest.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|ref=Diaz|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415073152/http://www.golfdigest.com/features/index.ssf?%2Ffeatures%2Fgd200501tigerdiaz1.html|archivedate=15 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) golfers actually seem to have played better against him.

== Further research ==

Three years after Brown’s study, in 2010, a similar one was conducted in Japan by Ryuichi Tanaka and Kazutoshi Ishino.&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanaka|first1=Ryuichi|last2=Ishino|first2=Kazutoshi|title=Testing the incentive effects in tournaments with a superstar|journal=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies|date=2012|volume=26|issue=3|pages=393–404|url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jjieco:v:26:y:2012:i:3:p:393-404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers look at how the presence of Japan golfer superstar [[Kazuo Ozaki]] affects the game of others and their findings are in accordance with those of the paper on Woods. Their results suggest that when having to compete against Ozaki, players perform worse by about 0.3 strokes on average.

Yet another research, published by Brian C. Hill in 2014,&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Brian|title=The Superstar Effect in 100-Meter Tournaments|journal=International Journal of Sport Finance|date=2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=111–129|url=http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:jsf:intjsf:v:9:y:2014:i:2:p:111-129}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the same effect in 100-meter tournaments with [[Usain Bolt]] being the superstar on the field. Surprisingly, Hill finds a ''positive'' superstar effect, meaning that runners produce faster running times and the likelihood of setting a personal record is increased. Wanting to explain the results seemingly contradictory to that of Brown’s, Hill points out the simultaneous nature of running competitions (whereas in golf, players get to watch each other) and that a 100-meter race is about 10 seconds which does not leave competitors much time to alter their behaviour because of Bolt.

== Relevance in management ==

The importance of studying the dynamics of rank-order tournaments with heterogeneous competitors reaches beyond the world of sports. Numerous management strategies use competition as an incentive for better productivity,&lt;ref name="Kellogg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caley|first1=Beverly A.|title=Golf Lessons: Competing with superstars adversely affects performance|url=https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/golf_lessons|website=KelloggInsight|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to the superstar effect, if agents are to rival a superstar, they may in fact reduce their efforts.

A '''third place playoff''', '''match/game for third place''', '''bronze medal game''' or '''consolation game''' is a single match that is included in many [[sport]]ing [[knockout tournament]]s to decide which competitor or team will be credited with finishing third and fourth. The teams that compete in the third place playoff game are usually the two losing [[semi-final]]ists in a particular knockout tournament.

Many tournaments use the third place playoff to determine who wins the [[bronze medal]]. In some tournaments, a third place playoff is necessary for seeding purposes if three or all four semi-finalists advance to another tournament.

In tournaments that do not award medals or have the third place finisher advance to something else, a third place playoff is a [[classification match]] that serves little more than as a consolation to the losing semi-finalists. A consolation game also allows teams to play more than one game after having invested time, effort and money in the quest for a championship. Third place playoffs held as such consolation games are subject to debate. Many sports tournaments do not have a third place playoff due to a lack of interest. It has been criticised by some who feel that the match serves little purpose, but others see this game as an occasion for the losing semi-finalists to salvage some pride. How seriously the competitors or teams take a third place playoff, may also be mixed: a heavily favoured team that lost in an upset in the semi-final round may not have as much incentive to win as would a [[Cinderella (sports)|"Cinderella" team]] who was not expected to advance that far.

==Olympics==
Most sports using a knockout format in the [[Olympic Games]] have a third place game to determine who wins the [[bronze medal]], with the exception being [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics|boxing]] which awards two bronze medals ([[Judo at the Summer Olympics|judo]], [[Taekwondo at the Summer Olympics|taekwondo]], and [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|wrestling]], which also award two bronze medals, both feature two bronze medal matches, between the losing semi-finalists and the winners of the [[repechage]]). As the difference between a bronze medal and no medal is quite significant, competitors still take this game seriously.

==IRB Rugby World Cup==
The [[Rugby World Cup]] used to give automatic qualification to all teams in the top three of the ongoing tournament to the one that would follow it four years later thus making the third place playoff game important, but this was later scrapped after the 1999 edition of the tournament allowing teams outside the top three to automatically qualify depending on their IRB co-efficient in the rankings.

==FIFA World Cup and other association football tournaments==
The [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 edition]] was the last [[UEFA European Football Championship]] to have a third place match. That was one of the few third place football matches ever to be decided by a penalty shootout, where [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] defeated hosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 9-8.

The [[FIFA World Cup]] features a third place playoff, usually on the day before the final. It is often there to provide a spectacle as there is often a gap of a few days between the semi-finals and the final. The third place playoff is considered a lower-priority match to organizers, as it is frequently scheduled in one of the smaller stadia; the largest stadium (usually located in the host nation's capital city) is reserved for the final, while the semi-finals occupy the second and third-largest stadia. However, the [[1994 FIFA World Cup#Third-place match|third place match]] in the 1994 World Cup did use the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] stadium, the same venue that would later host the tournament final, setting a record attendance of 91,500 for a third place playoff in FIFA World Cup history.

The [[UEFA Nations League]] will also have a third place playoff, this game will be played on the same day as the final. 

The third-place match in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] has been somewhat more important to the organizers—the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup#Match for third place|1999]], [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup#Third Place|2003]], and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup#Third place playoff|2007]] matches were all held in the same stadium as the final. In fact, the 1999 and 2007 third-place matches were both held as the first half of a doubleheader that culminated in the final. The [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup#Third place play-off|2011]] third-place match returned to the more traditional scheduling of the day before the final in a different stadium. Notably, the 1999 third-place match was the curtain-raiser to the most-attended women's sporting event in history, the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final|1999 final]] also held in the Rose Bowl.

The third place match is generally a high-scoring affair, as no men's match has seen fewer than two goals scored since Poland's 1-0 win over Brazil in 1974, while all bronze-medal games since 1994 (except for 1998, 2014 and 2018) have seen four goals or more. For tournament top scorers, the third place match's tendency of attacking football is a great opportunity to win the Golden Shoe, with players such as [[Salvatore Schillaci]] (1990), [[Davor Šuker]] (1998), and [[Thomas Müller]] (2010) getting the goal they needed to take sole possession of the lead.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/418354-3rd4th-play-off-preview|title=2010 FIFA World Cup: Third Place Play-Off Preview Germany vs. Uruguay|first=Eugene|last=Fogarty|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] has had only seven editions to date, therefore creating less opportunity for a pattern to form. However, two of the third-place games in that competition have seen fewer than three goals. In 1995, the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]] defeated [[China women's national football team|China]] 2–0. In 1999, the third-place match between [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] and [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] ended in a scoreless draw and penalty shootout (won by Brazil), as did the final between the USA and China (won by the USA). In 2015, the third place match between [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] and [[England women's national football team|England]] was the first to go to extra time, and in the second period of extra time, England scored a single penalty kick goal and held on to the lead to upset Germany.

How seriously the competing teams take this match is subject to debate. Certain teams, especially ones which had been expected to reach the final, will rest some of their starters to allow some of their reserve team players to participate in a World Cup game. For instance French team captain [[Michel Platini]] did not play in either the 1982 or 1986 third place matches, while German goalkeeper [[Hans-Jörg Butt]] received his only competitive international appearance in a third place playoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/worldcup2010/2010/07/2010710194753550606.html|title=Germany beat Uruguay to bronze|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991644.stm|title=Germany 3-1 Portugal|date=8 July 2006|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Michel Vorm]] came on during injury time of the 3–0 third place play-off win against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Brasília]] thus ensuring that all 23 Dutch squad members played at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28173517|title=Brazil 0–3 Netherlands|date=12 July 2014|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[Cinderella (sports)|teams that are not expected to get this far]] usually take this match seriously, as third place can be a historical achievement.  In the 1994 World Cup, the Sweden national team branded the game as "the bronze match" and after victory they landed at Arlanda with a fighter escort and were then paraded through the streets of Stockholm to millions live on national TV. Another example of a high-profile third place match was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], when the recently established [[Croatian national football team|Croatian football team]] upset the Netherlands.

If the host nation is involved in the third place match, the team generally uses the match to thank the support of their fans (such as the [[South Korea national football team|South Korean football team]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], and the [[Germany national football team|German football team]] in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; German [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Oliver Kahn]], who had been a reserve to [[Jens Lehmann]] during the 2006 tournament, was allowed to retire in the third place playoff by then manager [[Jürgen Klinsmann]]. Germany and Portugal fielded strong lineups in that match, after both were narrowly eliminated in their respective semi-finals (Germany and Italy nearly went to a penalty shootout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991640.stm|title=Last-gasp Italy knock Germany out|date=4 July 2006|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Portugal was defeated by the lower-ranked France&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991632.stm|title=Portugal 0-1 France|date=5 July 2006|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], the dismal 3–0 loss to the Netherlands in the 2014 third place match, along with the [[Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)|7-1 semi-final defeat to Germany]], led to coach [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] being dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28173517]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/world-cup-disaster-leaves-scolari-reputation-tainted-025054984--sow.html | title=World Cup disaster leaves Scolari reputation tainted | date=13 July 2014 | publisher=AFP | via=Yahoo | first=Andy | last=Scott | accessdate=10 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Dutch, this was their first bronze medal in the FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/dcunited/netherlands-leads-host-brazil-2-0-at-halftime/2014/07/12/4dbde078-0a06-11e4-85e4-3143dddacfe9_story.html|title=- The Washington Post|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany currently holds the most third-place finishes in the (men's) World Cup, with four, their most recent in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/third-place-magic-for-germany/article1635808/|title=Third-place magic for Germany|date=10 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has the most third-place finishes in the Women's World Cup, with three; they have never finished outside the top three.

==Little League World Series==
For most of its history, the [[Little League World Series]] has featured either a consolation bracket, or consolation games. Currently, the tournament features a single consolation game between the United States runner-up and the International runner-up.  Like the championship, the game allows an American team to compete against an International team.  All other games are played within their respective American or International pool of eight teams each, except two exhibition games which match the United States teams and International teams which went 0-2 in their respective brackets.

==Early season College Basketball Tournaments==
Third place games (and consolation games for lower placings) are common in early season college basketball tournaments, as it gives each team an opportunity to play more games before the conference games start in earnest.  It also provides the tournament venue with additional games.

==Defunct third place playoff games==
Many sports tournaments do not have a third place playoff, mostly due to a lack of interest from the competitors and also from the fans. Two of the most celebrated knockout tournaments — the [[FA Cup Third-fourth place matches]] (1970–1974) and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] (1946–1981) — did feature the third place game for a period of time, but later abandoned it. For most of its years, the NCAA consolation game held interest because it usually featured two nationally ranked teams in which only a few teams qualified for the tournament. However, as the field expanded beyond 32 teams, the game lost significance.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  In addition, eliminating the game allowed the losing teams to return home rather than remaining in the Final Four city for an additional two days to play a game many{{who|date=April 2017}} believed was irrelevant. Relevancy aside, others{{who|date=April 2017}} supported the game for competitive reasons because it typically featured a match between two of the best college teams in the nation; and, it allowed each of those teams to be honored as a Final Four team for the entire weekend.

The [[National Football League]] had a consolation game, the [[Playoff Bowl]], from {{nfly|1960}} to {{nfly|1969}}, which pitted the second-place team in each of the two conferences (based on regular season record from 1960 to {{nfly|1966}}) against each other in [[Miami Orange Bowl|Miami]], [[Florida]]. Through the 1966 season, the only scheduled NFL playoff game was the [[History of the National Football League championship|Championship Game]] (with unscheduled conference tie-breaker games as necessary; only in [[1965 NFL playoffs|1965]] during the 1960s). In {{nfly|1967}}, the [[1967 NFL playoffs|NFL playoff field]] expanded to four (division champions), and its first round losers went to the Playoff Bowl, increasingly unpopular with the participating players. With interest declining for a third-place game and an [[1970–71 NFL playoffs|eight-team playoff field]] arriving with the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in {{nfly|1970}}, the Playoff Bowl was abandoned with little objection.

Third place playoffs are especially controversial when they are used in tournaments that use a [[Page playoff system]] since there is only one "semi-final" game in this format. Critics argue that in such a formula, the loser of the semi-final should simply be awarded third place. Proponents of the third place game argue that without it, the importance of the [[medal round]] is cheapened since the top two teams heading into the Page playoff would otherwise be "guaranteed" a medal - this argument carries less weight in tournaments where medals are not awarded or where they are considered of relatively minor importance in comparison to winning the tournament.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22663">'''[[Tobacco]]''' usage in '''[[sport]]''' is a well documented and publicised occurrence. [[Tobacco advertising]] has connected itself to sports both for the connotations of health that sports provide, as well as the marketing potential of famous athletes.  Additionally, tobacco has played a role in the sport of [[baseball]] specifically and has affected both the rules affecting players and fan alike.  Agencies such as the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] have used sports as platforms for tobacco prevention programs, specifically targeted at younger people.

==Advertising==
[[File:White Borders baseball card reverse.JPG|thumb|Back of an old baseball card]]
For many years, [[Tobacco industry|tobacco companies]] have played a monumental role in advertising within the sports industry.  Major tobacco companies have employed the strategies of athletic endorsements, sponsorships of major athletic events, and creating powerful associations of tobacco and active lifestyles in order to advertise their products. The connection between sports and tobacco can be traced back to the origins of professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faverodental.com/2015/02/smokeless-tobacco-and-baseball/|title=Favero Family Dental {{!}}   Smokeless Tobacco and Baseball|website=www.faverodental.com|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the [[National League|National Baseball League]]'s inception in 1876, [[Baseball card|trading cards]] with player's images emerged within cigarette packages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/1.full#xref-ref-2-1 Tobacco in sport: an endless addiction?] Tob Control 2005;14:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the oldest brands of [[chewing tobacco]], [[W. T. Blackwell and Company Tobacco Factory|Bull Durham]], advertised on outfield fences in [[baseball park]]s in the United States South.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Despite this long-standing history, there have been many recent developments and changes in tobacco's relation to athletics.  Currently, trends have shifted as athletes today are more likely to endorse tobacco prevention efforts as opposed to tobacco products.

===Endorsements===
From the 1920s to 1940s baseball furthered its relation with tobacco.  Every major league team had a cigarette sponsor and baseball's greatest athletes such as [[Babe Ruth]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Ted Williams]], all appeared in cigarette advertisements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Lou Gehrig]] endorsed [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]’ [[Camel (cigarette)|Camels]], saying he could smoke as many as he pleased and creating the slogan that Camels “don’t get your wind.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|last= Brandt
|first= Allan
|title= The Cigarette Century
|publisher=[[Basic Books]]
|date=2007
|isbn=0-465-07047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As tensions mounted in the 1950s, with smoking's correlation to [[lung cancer]], the [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Commissioner of Baseball]] prohibited players from wearing their uniforms in cigarette advertisements.  While baseball cracked down on endorsements, the [[National Football League]] not only permitted players to appear in tobacco advertisements but also signed [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]]’ [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] as its major television sponsor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  Of these players, one of the most prominent was [[Frank Gifford]].  Gifford played for the [[New York Giants]] in the 1950s and 1960s and later became a famous sportscaster.  In his prime, Gifford endorsed a wide range of products, including The [[American Tobacco Company]]'s [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=tobacco-advertising-1960s |title=tobacco advertising 1960s |publisher=The Pop History Dig |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the tobacco industry began to anticipate increased federal regulation and voluntarily adopted the Cigarette Advertising Code, stating it would not “depict as a smoker any person well known as being, or having been, an athlete…[or] any person participating in, or obviously having just participated in, physical activity requiring stamina or athletic conditioning beyond that of normal recreation”. Under this code, athletes and celebrities were no longer allowed to give testimonials, but nonetheless the industry blatantly disregarded its own guidelines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In October 2009, Baisha, [[China]]’s largest cigarette company, signed [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]], an Olympic gold medalist hurdler, to endorse its cigarettes in both print advertisements and televised commercials.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Sponsorships===
Traditionally, cigarette companies have had a strong relationship with [[Tobacco advertising#NASCAR auto racing|NASCAR events]].  After tobacco companies were forced to pull out of advertising in [[NASCAR]], [[Nicorette]] has entered the NASCAR arena and signed a three-year contract as part of an extension by GlaxoSmithKline, then the owner of Goody's Headache Powders, a long-time NASCAR sponsor.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horovitz |first=Bruce |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-01-26-nascar-usat_x.htm |title=Nicorette, NASCAR sign sponsorship deal |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-01-27 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASCAR's deal with Nicorette was only for one year. Winston stepped down after 33 years as title sponsor of NASCAR's championship series and was replaced by Nextel.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"/&gt;  Nicorette sees a great market as NASCAR fans are 28% more likely to smoke than other adults. The firm also reported that they smoke 18% more cigarettes than other adults.&lt;ref name="usatoday2005"/&gt;  Since Nicorette has signed on as a sponsor, there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of NASCAR employees who smoke.  Nicorette began its quit smoking program in 2004, providing NASCAR members with training sessions and one-on-one counseling.  Additionally, Nicorette has counseled about 250,000 race fans on how to quit smoking since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/10/31 ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarette companies have explored the sponsorship of rodeo since the early 1970s. From 1986 to 2009 the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] was sponsored by the [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]] as well as the [[National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association]] (NIRA) since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ling|first=Pamela M.|last2=Haber|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Wedl|first3=Stefani|title=Branding the Rodeo: A Case Study of Tobacco Sports Sponsorship|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2008.144097|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=100|issue=1|pages=32–41|doi=10.2105/ajph.2008.144097|pmid=19910357|pmc=2791245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association severed its ties with the tobacco industry in 2009, allowing [[rodeo]] culture to return to its status before tobacco's involvement in 1986.  “Cowboy Ted” Hallisey, a prominent print and broadcast journalist for rodeo events stated “Without [[big tobacco]], rodeos will move into mainstream sports because they will be more comfortable for children and families to attend”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobacco-facts.net/2009/12/professional-rodeo-cowboys-association-ends-tobacco-sponsorship |title=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Ends Tobacco Sponsorship &amp;#124; Tobacco Facts |publisher=Tobacco Facts. |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising strategies===
In the early 1900s the tobacco industry sought to pair smoking with active and healthy lifestyles.  Through its advertisements, the tobacco industry created associations between smoking and recreational and athletic activities like tennis, golf, swimming, football, track and field, skiing, and ice skating.  These activities were often depicted in cigarette advertising as activities demanding a cigarette for enhanced performance and even good health.  American Tobacco's Lucky Strikes ran a successful advertising campaign that urged men and women “To keep a slender figure, reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.”

=== Advertising and Sponsorship in Australia ===
One of the first countries to ever legislate the end of tobacco advertising and sponsorship at sporting events was Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Quit Victoria in Australia, stated that the three major sponsors for sport in 1980 were the largest tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/fandi/fandi/c15s5.htm|title=15.5 Sponsorship|website=www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the tobacco industry put a whopping 34 million dollars into [[cricket]] and [[rugby league]]. Although advertisement of tobacco products on television had been banned in 1976, on ground advertising and naming rights to oppositions and events was tactically used by tobacco companies; for example, the [[Benson &amp; Hedges|Benson and Hedges]] logo would appear for approximately 90 minutes in a day’s play of [[test cricket]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/knowledge_base/organised_sport/sport_integrity/tobacco_sponsorship_and_advertising_in_sport|title=Clearinghouse for Sport|last=|first=|date=|website=Tobacco Sponsorship and Advertising in Sport|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco advertising [[Prohibition Act|prohibition act]] 1992, prohibited nearly all of tobaccos advertising and sponsorships in sporting events. However, under section 18 of the Act, there was power to allow an exception to the general ban on tobacco advertising in Australia for sporting events of international significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00440|title=Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, there was an amendment to remove this act and Australian sport became totally tobacco sponsorship and advertisement free in October 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Smokeless tobacco ==
[[Smokeless tobacco]]: [[chewing tobacco]], [[Dipping tobacco|spit tobacco]], [[Snuff (tobacco)|dry snuff]], [[snus]], or ‘tabac à chiquer’ in France, is very common in some sports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is little data on the number of athletes that use smokeless tobacco, but a study showed that approximately 45 percent of major league baseball players have been reported to use smokeless tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiamulera|first=Cristiano|last2=Leone|first2=Roberto|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Guido|date=2007-12-01|title=Smokeless tobacco use in sports: ‘legal doping’?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01993.x/abstract|journal=Addiction|language=en|volume=102|issue=12|pages=1847–1848|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2007.01993.x|issn=1360-0443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes apparently used smokeless tobacco to enhance their performance because nicotine improved certain aspects of physiology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chagué|first=Frédéric|last2=Guenancia|first2=Charles|last3=Gudjoncik|first3=Aurélie|last4=Moreau|first4=Daniel|last5=Cottin|first5=Yves|last6=Zeller|first6=Marianne|title=Smokeless tobacco, sport and the heart|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1875213614002678|journal=Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases|volume=108|issue=1|pages=75–83|doi=10.1016/j.acvd.2014.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been found that smokeless tobacco can cause many harmful health effects such as [[cancer]], mouth and tooth problems, [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/smokeless-tobacco|title=Health Risks of Smokeless Tobacco|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball and tobacco==
Between 1920 until 1940, when baseball was Americas most popular sport, every team had a tobacco sponsor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; It is common perception that many baseball players use tobacco.  According to the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] however this practice is changing and declining.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mychael Urban&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080630&amp;content_id=3037249&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Tobacco use in baseball on the decline &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One source states that a reason chewing tobacco usage increased among baseball players was the misconception that it improved concentration, overall performance and was less harmful than smoking a cigarette. Contrary to this, chewing tobacco does not have an established connection to the performance of baseball players.&lt;ref name="publichealthgreybruce1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthgreybruce.on.ca/Tobacco/Chewing/Sports.htm |title=Chewing Tobacco - Sports |publisher=Publichealthgreybruce.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As more information about [[Health effects of tobacco#Particular forms of tobacco use|the dangers of chewing tobacco]] has come to light it has become stigmatized within baseball itself with players, staff and managers often having to "sneak" off to partake.  These individuals understand that children will easily copy their actions and try to hide them now, as they are negative role models for youth.  Most players have made attempts to quit, but the majority struggle in breaking their addiction.&lt;ref name="costkids1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/smokelesstobacco/smokelesstobacco.htm |title=Smokeless Tobacco |publisher=Costkids.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628060817/http://www.costkids.org/tobacco/smokelesstobacco/smokelesstobacco.htm |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lenny Dykstra]], the former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] center-fielder, started [[Dipping tobacco|dipping]] at a young age, unaware of how difficult quitting would be. He tells young children, "They call me "Nails" because they say I'm as tough as nails. But I'm not tough enough to beat the spit-tobacco habit. Copy my hustle, copy my determination. But don't copy my spit-tobacco habit."&lt;ref name="costkids1"/&gt;  In addition Major League Baseball has taken actions to lower tobacco usage amongst its players.  This includes a complete ban on tobacco with fines for players and their managers if it is discovered.  In the major leagues tobacco companies are no longer allowed to leave free products in stadium clubhouses for the players, with a ban effective December 5, 2016, in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement that prohibits players entering MLB for the first time from using tobacco.  (Players who had experience in MLB prior to the day are grandfathered.)  &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  Baseball stadiums have stricter tobacco policies for patrons as well though the level of strictness varies per stadium.&lt;ref name="no-smoke1"&gt;[http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/majorleaguebaseballstadiumpoliices.pdf Smoking Policies at Major League Baseball Stadiums], May 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tobacco prevention and sports==
The majority of tobacco smokers start smoking before they graduate high school.  The CDC has identified youth sports as an area where tobacco education and prevention will help limit the number of first time smokers and has begun a Tobacco Free Sports Movement to encourage non smoking practices in athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/youth/sports/index.htm |title=Smoking and Tobacco Use :: Youth Tobacco Prevention :: Tobacco-Free Sports Initiatives :: Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) :: CDC |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CDC has paired with many large organizations to achieve this goal. These include public health agencies such as the [[National Cancer Institute]], and sport regulatory bodies such as [[FIFA]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] to further the efforts of tobacco elimination in sports.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  The [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]] banned not only tobacco usage, but advertising, sponsorship, promotion and sale of tobacco products in Olympic venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpro.who.int/china/sites/tfi/tfo.htm |title=WHO China-Tobacco-free Olympics |publisher=Wpro.who.int |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2010-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713060044/http://www.wpro.who.int/china/sites/tfi/tfo.htm |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Olympics with a tobacco company as a sponsor were in 1984, and control has gotten stricter since then (as can be seen from the Beijing regulations).&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/14/1/1.full Tobacco in sport: an endless addiction?] Tob Control 2005;14:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  On a smaller scale there are regional efforts to create tobacco free sports initiatives such as the Tobacco-Free Athletes of Maine.  This organization seeks to have coaches educate their young athletes about the effects of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccofreemaine.org/channels/educators/tobacco_free_athletes.php |title=Tobacco-Free Athletes - Tobacco Prevention for Youth in Sports &amp; Community Programs - Partnership For A Tobacco-Free Maine |publisher=Tobaccofreemaine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many athletes have become spokespersons for [[Tobacco control movement|anti-tobacco]] and tobacco prevention efforts.  Early in the 20th century Hall of Fame baseball player [[Honus Wagner]] would not allow a cigarette company to use his picture on a tobacco trading card.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;  Since then famous athletes like skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; and baseball player [[Sammy Sosa]] have supported tobacco prevention.&lt;ref name="publichealthgreybruce1"/&gt;  Events such as the [[American Cancer Society]]'s [[Great American Smokeout]] also make use of athletes to support their anti-tobacco efforts.  In 2000, the American Cancer Society had [[Alonzo Mourning]] of the [[Miami Heat]] (with other athletes) speak to children about the dangers of smoking.&lt;ref name="cancer1"&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Athletes_Pitch_in_to_Send_Quit_Smoking_Message_during_Great_American_Smokeout.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025103726/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Athletes_Pitch_in_to_Send_Quit_Smoking_Message_during_Great_American_Smokeout.asp |date=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team]] celebrated their gold medal victory on the ice with both cigars and tobacco.  As the Vancouver Olympics were a tobacco free event, the International Olympic Committee decided to look into the celebration since it was a breach of anti-tobacco rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBSSports.com wire reports |url=http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/story/12978672/ioc-to-look-into-drinking-celebrations-on-ice-by-women-hockey-team |title=IOC to look into drinking celebrations on ice by women's hockey team - Olympics |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate [[Eric Reid (American football)|Eric Reid]] say they choose to kneel during the anthem to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. "After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from [[Nate Boyer]], a retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem as a peaceful protest," said Reid.

He explained his decision to switch was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members while still protesting during the anthem.

I'm playing hard because I've got this right – freedom, because of the vets.

[[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) have released a statement in September 2017 regarding any potential protests "The march of players, officials and children into our stadiums and singing of the anthem has been a pre-match tradition since our first game in 1996.

The protest had supporters outside the U.S. as well: In an October 2017 match against [[Schalke 04]], players and staff of German football club [[Hertha BSC]] took the knee in solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2017/10/14/hertha-berlin-kneel-german-national-anthem-protest|title=Hertha Berlin players take knee during German anthem|last=Rapaport|first=Daniel|date=October 14, 2017|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herta BSC has a few American players on their roster.

After his first kneel in 2016, Nike was well on its way to sever its four year long partnership with NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/sports/nike-colin-kaepernick.html|title=Nike Nearly Dropped Colin Kaepernick Before Embracing Him|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigel Powell, chief communications executive of Nike, convinced the company to maintain their partnership with Kaepernick which eventually led to the launch of the politically and socially controversial advertisement released in 2018, "Nike - Dream Crazy", with Kaepernick as their face of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nike|title=Nike - Dream Crazy|date=2018-09-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2CvmgoO7I|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the prevalent backlash on social media of people who criticized Kaepernick's actions burning and cutting up their Nike brand clothing, Nike sales increased by 31% within five days after the advertisement was released. This campaign did result in a temporary drop of 2.2% in stock price though.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5390884/nike-sales-go-up-kaepernick-ad/|title=Nike Sales Increase 31% After Kaepernick Ad Despite Backlash|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/nike-colin-kaepernick-ads-national-anthem-protest-controversy.html|title=Some people may hate Nike's marketing campaigns—but the brand keeps adding billions to its bottom line|last=Turner|first=Dymond Green, Ashley|date=2018-09-19|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletes and sports media===
Throughout the remainder of the 2016 season, Kaepernick received public backlash for his protest, with an anonymous [[NFL]] executive calling Kaepernick "a traitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651681-mike-freemans-10-point-stance-kaepernick-anger-intense-in-nfl-front-offices|title=Kaepernick Anger Intense in NFL Front Offices|first=Mike|last=Freeman|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he received death threats.&lt;ref name="deaththreats"&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/nfl-kaepernick-received-death-threats-160921152934415.html US: Colin Kaepernick says he has received death threats]. [[Al Jazeera]]. September 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] offered support for Kaepernick stating, "Patriotism comes in many forms and what has happened is it's been conflated with a bumper-style kind of flag-waving and with the military only so that people cannot see that in his own way Colin Kaepernick, however imperfectly, is doing a patriotic thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/09/bob-costas-trump-nfl|title=Bob Costas puts the entire national anthem debate in perspective with one powerful segment|date=September 25, 2017|work=For The Win|access-date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trent Dilfer]] criticized Kaepernick. "The big thing that hit me through all this was this is a backup quarterback whose job is to be quiet, and sit in the shadows and get the starter ready to play Week 1," Dilfer said on ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]''. "Yet he chose a time where all of a sudden he became the center of attention. And it has disrupted that organization. It has caused friction. And it's torn at the fabric of the team."&lt;ref name="mercury"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Cam|title=Colin Kaepernick told by ESPN's Trent Dilfer to 'be quiet, sit in the shadows'|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/11/colin-kaepernick-told-by-espns-trent-dilfer-to-be-quiet-sit-in-the-shadows/|website=The Mercury News|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stemming from the Kaepernick controversy, before the beginning of the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]] tournament in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]], Team USA coach [[John Tortorella]] told in an interview that if any one of his players were to sit out during the anthem, they would sit on the bench for the entire duration of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/world-cup-of-hockey/tortorella-will-sit-anthem-protests-team-usa/|title=Tortorella 'will sit' any Team USA player who protests anthem - Sportsnet.ca|newspaper=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2016 police shootings of [[Shooting of Terence Crutcher|Terence Crutcher]] and [[Shooting of Keith Lamont Scott|Keith Lamont Scott]] bolstered support for his protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Francis|title=Silence From Kaepernick Critics Speaks Volumes|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/57e2f47fe4b05d3737be53de?timestamp=1474507429354|website=[[HuffPost]]|date=September 21, 2016|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaepernick said of the Terence Crutcher shooting, "this is a perfect example of what this is about."&lt;ref name="deaththreats"/&gt; Boxer [[Floyd Mayweather]], criticized Kaepernick, stating, "You know, a lot of times, we get stuck, and we are followers. When you hear one person say 'black lives matter' or 'blue lives matter,' all lives matter." Adding moments later, "With me being a fighter, and my hands being registered, if I hit a guy for breaking in my house, or breaking in my car, it's gonna cost me more money, so I gotta work smarter, not harder. I'm gonna call the cops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Payne|first=Marissa|title=Floyd Mayweather advises people to 'follow order' because 'all lives matter'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/10/11/floyd-mayweather-advises-people-to-follow-order-because-all-lives-matter/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion continued throughout August 2017. [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Famer]] Hank Aaron said, "I think he's getting a raw deal" from the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Axisa|first=Mike|title=MLB Hall of Famer Hank Aaron says Colin Kaepernick is 'getting a raw deal' from NFL|url=https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-hall-of-famer-hank-aaron-says-colin-kaepernick-is-getting-a-raw-deal-from-nfl/|publisher=CBS Sports|website=CBSSports.com|date=August 26, 2017|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r and longtime [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] [[Jim Brown]], who a year earlier supported Kaepernick "100 percent",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000692374/article/jim-brown-im-with-colin-kaepernick-100-percent|title=Jim Brown: I'm with Colin Kaepernick '100 percent'|publisher=National Football League|date=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; now criticized him, suggesting Kaepernick ought to decide whether to be an athlete or an activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/08/25/jim-brown-says-i-dont-desecrate-my-flag-thinks-colin-kaepernick-should-pick-football-or-activism/|title=Jim Brown says 'I don't desecrate my flag,' thinks Colin Kaepernick should pick football or activism|website=The Washington Post|access-date=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm an American," said Brown.

[[File:ValerieFraserCup.jpg|thumb|The Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup - Blue Riband Trophy in Women's Shinty]]

==History==
The trophy was originally donated to the [[Camanachd Association]] in memory of Valerie Fraser.  It was originally a trophy for male teams and it was won by [[Glenurquhart Shinty Club|Glenurquhart]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/8287/shinty.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:04:06 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some years later, after the competition fell into abeyance, it was donated to the Women's Camanachd Association and was first played for on the 28th of July 2002.

In 2009, the WCA held the semi-finals on one day at [[University of Stirling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stirlingobserver.co.uk/stirling-sport/other-sport-stirling/2009/06/03/shinty-university-action-51226-23770012/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Glengarry defeated Tir Conaill Harps 2-1 to win the 2009 Cup. There is also a national trophy for Division Two teams, the [[Marine Harvest]] Challenge Cup.

2013 saw an epic final at The Eilan, where Badenoch and Stathspey's Jane Nicol, in her final game before retirement, secured the victory over a heavily fancied Glasgow Mid-Argyll. GMA would however overcome Skye in 2014 and Badenoch in 2015 to secure League and Cup doubles.

The 2016 cup final was contested on the 28th of August at An Aird in Fort William between Skye Camanachd and Lochaber which meant a new name would be added to the list of winners as neither side had won the cup before. League Champions Skye were slight favourites but Lochaber won the day 4- 2, with all four of their goals coming from full-back turned forward Kirsty Delaney (6, 32, 67 and 76 mins). Lorna MacRae scored both the Skye goals (27, 74 mins). Player of the match went to Lochaber goalkeeper Aeleen Campbell for a fantastic display which prevented the Skye ladies from achieving the league and cup double.

Skye finally broke their Valerie Fraser hoodoo with a comprehensive 6-1 thumping of Lochaber at the same location, An Aird in 2017.

'''Weight cutting''' is the practice of fast [[weight loss]] prior to a sporting competition. It most frequently happens in order to qualify for a lower [[weight class]] (usually in [[combat sports]], where weight is a significant advantage) or in sports where it is advantageous to weigh as little as possible (most notably [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sports). There are two types of weight cutting: one method is to lose weight in the form of fat and muscle in the weeks prior to an event; the other is to lose weight in the form of water in the final days before competition.

Nutritional experts rarely give advice on how to cut weight safely or effectively, and recommend against cutting weight.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} However, many athletes choose to do it because they wish to gain an advantage in their sport.

== Dieting ==

In addition to improving performance through [[healthy eating]], some athletes will seek to lose weight through [[dieting]] and [[aerobic exercise]].  By losing fat they hope to achieve a higher "strength-to-mass ratio" or "lean weight."  This means more muscle and less fat, and should theoretically give them an advantage against other athletes of the same weight.
