The '''Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model - ''' is a [[conceptual model]] aimed at demonstrating the factors that lead to the use of health services. According to the model, usage of health services (including inpatient care, physician visits, dental care etc.) is determined by three dynamics: predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need. Predisposing factors can be characteristics such as race, age, and health beliefs.  For instance, an individual who believes health services are an effective treatment for an ailment is more likely to seek care. Examples of enabling factors could be family support, access to health insurance, one's community etc. Need represents both perceived and actual need for health care services. The original model was developed by Ronald M. Andersen, a health services professor at [[UCLA]], in 1968. The original model was expanded through numerous iterations and its most recent form models past the use of services to end at health outcomes and includes feedback loops.&lt;ref name="revisiting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Ronald|title=Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: does it matter?|journal=J Health Soc Behav|year=1995|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=7738325|doi=10.2307/2137284}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access and Mutability==
A major motivation for the development of the model was to offer measures of access. Andersen discusses four concepts within access that can be viewed through the conceptual framework. Potential access is the presence of enabling resources, allowing the individual to seek care if needed. Realized access is the actual use of care, shown as the outcome of interest in the earlier models. The Andersen framework also makes a distinction between equitable and inequitable access.  Equitable access is driven by demographic characteristics and need whereas inequitable access is a result of social structure, health beliefs, and enabling resources.

Andersen also introduces the concept of mutability of his factors. The idea here being that if a concept has a high degree of mutability (can be easily changed) perhaps policy would be justified in using its resources to do rather than a factor with low mutability. Characteristics that fall under demographics are quite difficult to change, however, enabling resources is assigned a high degree of mutability as the individual, community, or national policy can take steps to alter the level of enabling resources for an individual. For example, if the government decides to expand the [[Medicaid]] program an individual may experience an increase in enabling resources, which in turn may beget an increase in health services usage. The [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]] (HIE) changed a highly mutable factor, out-of-pocket costs, which greatly changed individual rates of health services usage.&lt;ref name="rand hie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=J|title=Free for All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-31846-3|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/commercial_books/CB199.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Models==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lifecycle andersen.png|thumb|right|alt=Earlier versions of the Andersen model.|Lifecycle of the Andersen Model.&lt;ref name="revisiting" /&gt;]] --&gt;
The initial behavior model was an attempt to study of why a family uses health services.  However, due to the heterogeneity of family members the model focused on the individual rather than the family as the unit of analysis. Andersen also states that the model functions both to predict and explain use of health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R|author2=Newman JF|title=Societal and individual determinants of medical care utilization in the United States|journal=Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc|year=1973|volume=51|issue=1|pages=95–124|pmid=4198894|doi=10.2307/3349613|pmc=2690261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second model was developed in the 1970s in conjunction with Aday and colleagues at the [[University of Chicago]]. This iteration includes systematic concepts of health care such as current policy, resources, and organization. The second generation model also extends the outcome of interest beyond utilization to consumer satisfaction.&lt;ref name=second&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aday|first=Lu Ann|author2=Andersen R|title=A framework for the study of access to medical care|journal=Health Serv Res|year=1974|volume=9|issue=3|pmid=4436074|pmc=1071804|pages=208–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of the model builds upon this idea by including health status (both perceived and evaluated) as outcomes alongside consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, this model include personal health practices as an antecedent to outcomes, acknowledging that it not solely use of health services that drives health and satisfaction. This model emphasizes a more public health approach of prevention, as advocated by Evans and Stoddart&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=RG|author2=Stoddart GL|title=Producing health, consuming health care|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1990|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1347–63|pmid=2126895|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein personal health practices (i.e. smoking, diet, exercise) are included as a driving force towards health outcomes.

== Current Model ==
The 6th iteration of Andersen’s conceptual framework &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the individual as the unit of analysis and goes beyond health care utilization, adopting health outcomes as the endpoint of interest.  This model is further differentiated from its predecessors by using a feedback loop to illustrate that health outcomes may affect aspects such as health beliefs, and need.  It added genetic susceptibility as a predisposing determinant and quality of life as an outcome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Pamela L.|last3=Baumeister|first3=Sebastian E.|title=Improving Access to Care in: Chaning the U.S. Health Care System|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Baumeister/publication/306017030_Andersen2014_Improving_Access_to_Care_in_Kominski_Changing_the_US_Health_Care_System/data/57aace3e08ae42ba52ad8a24/Andersen2014-Improving-Access-to-Care-in-Kominski-Changing-the-US-Health-Care-System.pdf|website=researchgate.net |publisher=Jossey Bass|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the framework’s relationships we can determine the directionality of the effect following a change in an individual’s characteristics or environment. For example, if one experiences an increase in need as a result of an infection, the Andersen model predicts this will lead to an increased use of services (all else equal). One potential change for a future iteration of this model is to add genetic information under predisposing characteristics.&lt;ref name=true&gt;{{cite journal|last=True|first=WR|author2=et. al|title=Genetic and environmental contributions to healthcare need and utilization: a twin analysis|journal=Health Ser Res|year=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=9108803|pmc=1070168}}&lt;/ref&gt; As genetic information becomes more readily available it seems likely this could impact health services usage, as well as health outcomes, beyond what is already accounted for in the current model.&lt;ref name=rosenau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenau|first=PV|title=Reflections on the cost consequences of the new gene technology for health policy|journal=Int J Technol Assess Health Care|year=1994|volume=10|issue=4|pages=546–61|pmid=7843877|doi=10.1017/s0266462300008151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and Rebuttals==
The model has been criticized for not paying enough attention to culture and social interaction but Andersen argues this social structure is included in the ''predisposing characteristics'' component.&lt;ref name=guendelman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guendelman|first=S|title=Health care users residing on the Mexican border. What factors determine choice of the U.S. or Mexican health system?|journal=Med Care|year=1991|volume=29|issue=5|pages=419–29|pmid=2020207|doi=10.1097/00005650-199105000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Portes|first=A|author2=Kyle D |author3=Eaton WW |title=Mental illness and help-seeking behavior among Mariel Cuban and Haitian refugees in south Florida|journal=J Health Soc Behav|date=Dec 1992|volume=33|issue=4|pages=283–298|pmid=1464715|doi=10.2307/2137309}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-01-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Another criticism was the overemphasis of  need and at the expense of health beliefs and social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolinsky|first=FD|author2=Johnson RJ|title=The use of health services by older adults|journal=J Gerontol|date=Nov 1991|volume=46|issue=6|pages=S345-57|pmid=1940101|doi=10.1093/geronj/46.6.s345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Andersen argues need itself is a [[social construct]].  This is why need is split into perceived and evaluated. Where evaluated need represents a more measurable/objective need, perceived need is partly determined by health beliefs, such as whether or not people think their condition is serious enough to seek health services. Another limitation of the model is its emphasis on health care utilization or adopting health outcomes as a dichotomous factor, present or not present. Other help-seeking models also consider the type of help source, including informal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, C. J., Deane, F. P., Ciarrochi, J., &amp; Rickwood, D. (2005). Measuring help-seeking intentions: Properties of the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Canadian Journal of Counselling, 39(1), 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work has taken help-seeking behaviors further, and more real-world, by including online and other non-face-to-face sources.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. M., McLean, J. P., &amp; Sheffield, J. (2009). Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes. Archives of Suicide Research, 13(3), 264-276. doi: 10.1080/13811110903044419. {{PMID|19591000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9608">The '''Anna Karenina principle''' states that a deficiency in any [[Limiting factor|one of a number of factors]] dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided.

The name of the principle derives from [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words: in order to be happy, a family must be successful on ''each and every one'' of ''a'' ''range'' of criteria e.g.: sexual attraction, money issues, parenting, religion, in-laws. Failure on only ''one'' of these counts leads to ''un''happiness. Thus there are more ways for a family to be unhappy than happy.

In [[statistics]], the term ''Anna Karenina principle'' is used to describe [[Statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s: there are any number of ways in which a dataset may violate the [[null hypothesis]] and only one in which all the assumptions are satisfied.

==Examples==

===Failed domestication===
The Anna Karenina principle was popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, J. |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |date=March 1997 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond uses this principle to illustrate why so few wild animals have been successfully domesticated throughout history, as a deficiency in any one of a great number of factors can render a species undomesticable. Therefore, all successfully domesticated species are not so because of a particular positive trait, but because of a lack of any number of possible negative traits. In chapter 9, six groups of reasons for failed domestication of animals are defined:

*'''Diet''' – To be a candidate for domestication, a species must be easy to feed. Finicky eaters make poor candidates. Non-finicky omnivores make the best candidates.
*'''Growth rate''' – The animal must grow fast enough to be economically feasible. Elephant farmers, for example, would wait perhaps 12 years for their herd to reach adult size.
*'''Captive breeding''' – The species must breed well in captivity. Species having [[mating]] rituals prohibiting breeding in a farm-like environment make poor candidates for domestication. These rituals could include the need for privacy or long, protracted mating chases.
*'''Disposition''' – Some species are too ill-tempered to be good candidates for domestication. Farmers must not be at risk of life or injury every time they enter the animal pen. The [[zebra]] is of special note in the book, as it was recognized by local cultures and Europeans alike as extremely valuable and useful to domesticate, but it proved impossible to tame. Horses in Africa proved to be susceptible to disease and attack by a wide variety of animals, while the very characteristics that made the zebra hardy and survivable in the harsh environment of Africa also made it fiercely independent.
*'''Tendency to panic''' – Species are genetically predisposed to react to danger in different ways. A species that immediately takes flight is a poor candidate for domestication. A species that freezes, or mingles with the herd for cover in the face of danger, is a good candidate. [[Deer]] in North America have proven almost impossible to domesticate and have difficulty breeding in captivity. Horses, however, immediately thrived from the time they were introduced to North America in the 16th century.
*'''Social structure''' – Species of lone, independent animals make poor candidates. A species that has a strong, well defined [[social hierarchy]] is more likely to be domesticated. A species that can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on a human as the head of the hierarchy is best. Different social groups must also be tolerant of one another.

==Ecological risk assessment==
{{See also|Liebig's law of the minimum}}

Moore describes applications of the ''Anna Karenina principle'' in [[ecology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Successful ecological risk assessments are all alike; every unsuccessful ecological risk assessment fails in its own way. Tolstoy posited a similar analogy in his novel Anna Karenina : "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." By that, Tolstoy meant that for a marriage to be happy, it had to succeed in several key aspects. Failure on even one of these aspects, and the marriage is doomed . . . the Anna Karenina principle also applies to ecological risk assessments involving multiple stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Dwayne R.J.|title=The Principle Applied to Ecological Risk Assessments of Multiple Stressors|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal|date=March 2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=231–237|doi=10.1080/20018091094349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aristotle's version==

Much earlier, ''[[Aristotle]]'' states the same principle in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 2):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.2.ii.html Nicomachean Ethics], Translated by [[W. D. Ross]], Oxford University Press, Oxford; Revised edition (11 Jun 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult – to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue; For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Order in chaos of maladaptation==
Many experiments and observations of groups of humans, animals, trees, grassy plants, stockmarket prices, and changes in the banking sector proved the modified Anna Karenina principle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By studying the dynamics of correlation and variance in many systems facing external, or environmental, factors, we can typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, predict when one might occur, as correlation between individuals increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) goes up.... '''All well-adapted systems are alike, all non-adapted systems experience maladaptation in their own way,... But in the chaos of maladaptation, there is an order'''. It seems, paradoxically, that as systems become more different they actually become more correlated within limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-public/anna-karenina-principle-explains-bodily-stress-and-stockmarket-crashes Anna Karenina principle explains bodily stress and stockmarket crashes], University of Leicester, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This effect is proved for many systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=Alexander N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=Elena V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=Tatiana A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003_Correlations_Risk_and_Crisis_From_Physiology_to_Finance|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the adaptation of healthy people to a change in climate conditions to the analysis of fatal outcomes in oncological and cardiological clinics. The same effect is found in the stock market. The applicability of these two statistical indicators of stress, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations, for diagnosis of [[social stress]] in large groups was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;Rybnikov, S.R.; Rybnikova, N.A.; Portnov, B.A. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?] Psychology &amp; Developing Societies 29(1):98-123· March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mathematical backgrounds==
[[Vladimir Arnold]] in his book ''Catastrophe Theory'' describes "The Principle of Fragility of Good Things" which in a sense supplements the Principle of Anna Karenina: good systems must meet simultaneously a number of requirements; therefore, they are more fragile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... for systems belonging to the singular part of the stability boundary a small change of the parameters is more likely to send the system into the unstable region than into the stable region. This is a manifestation of a general principle stating that all good things (e.g. stability) are more fragile than bad things. It seems that in good situations a number of requirements must hold simultaneously, while to call a situation bad even one failure suffices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=V. I.|title=Catastrophe Theory|date=September 1992 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-54811-4 |edition=3rd Rev Exp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catastrophe_theory.html?id=GQoQyqia45gC |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Etymology and definition==
"Apophatic", {{lang-grc|ἀπόφασις}} ([[adjective]]); from ἀπόφημι ''apophēmi'', meaning "to deny". From ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'': 
{{quote|apophatic (adj.) "involving a mention of something one feigns to deny; involving knowledge obtained by negation", 1850, from Latinized form of Greek ''apophatikos'', from apophasis "denial, negation", from apophanai "to speak off," from apo "off, away from" (see apo-) + phanai "to speak," related to pheme "voice," from PIE root *bha- (2) "to speak, tell, say."{{r|OED|group=web}}}}

''Via negativa'' or ''via negationis'' ([[Latin]]), "negative way" or "by way of denial".{{sfn|McCombs|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=_cbuGVI_UNAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22negative+theology%22%22apophatic+theology%22%22via+negativa%22%22via+negationis%22 84]}} The negative way forms a pair together with the ''[[kataphatic]]'' or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,
{{quote|Dionysius describes the kataphatic or affirmative way to the divine as the "way of speech": that we can come to some understanding of the Transcendent by attributing all the perfections of the created order to God as its source. In this sense, we can say "God is Love", "God is Beauty", "God is Good". The apophatic or negative way stresses God's absolute transcendence and unknowability in such a way that we cannot say anything about the divine essence because God is so totally beyond being. The dual concept of the immanence and transcendence of God can help us to understand the simultaneous truth of both "ways" to God: at the same time as God is immanent, God is also transcendent. At the same time as God is knowable, God is also unknowable. God cannot be thought of as one or the other only.{{r|DC_interview|group=web}}}}

==Origins and development==
According to Fagenblat, "negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;" elements of it can be found in Plato's "unwritten doctrines," while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in [[Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}}

According to Carabine, "apophasis proper" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} and Meredith even states that Philo "is the real founder of the apophatic tradition."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} Yet, it was with [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]],{{sfn|Berthold|1985|p=9}} whose writings shaped both [[Hesychasm]], the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}}

==Greek philosophy==
{{See also|Epoché|Pyrrhonism|Skepticism}}

===Pre-Socratic===
For the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Epiphany (feeling)|Epiphany]] played an essential role in attaining this knowledge.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} [[Xenophanes]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}

According to [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BCE), [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods.{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=51}} The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his ''[[Theogony]]'' the birth of the gods and creation of the world,{{r|ellopsos|group=web}} which became an "ur-text for programmatic, first-person [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphanic]] narratives in Greek literature,"{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Hesiod's ''Theogony'' was highly referred in the time of [[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), and Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' shows a profound familiarity with Hesiod's ''Theogony''.{{sfn|Boys-Stones|Haubold|2009|p=xiviii}} See also Timaeus e39-e41.{{r|ellopsos|group=web}}}} but also "explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=52}} According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods "actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought."{{sfn|Platt|2011|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Richard G. Geldard: "[M]ore than any other pre-Socratic thinker, Heraclitus embodies the apophatic method. He "unsaid" the myths of the Archaic tradition on his way to transforming the ideas of divinity through the divine Logos. It was a transformation affirmed by Plotinus 800 years later."{{sfn|Geldard|2000|p=23}}}}

[[Parmenides]] (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem ''On Nature'', gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. "The way of conviction" explores Being, true reality ("what-is"), which is "What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109-111}} "The way of opinion" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's [[allegory of the Cave]]. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=111-112}} Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the [[mystery cults]],{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=109}} giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}} Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to "attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=112}}

===Plato===
[[File:Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377.jpg|thumb|Plato Silanion Musei Capitolini MC1377]]
[[Plato]] (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), "deciding for Parmenides against [[Heraclitus]]" and his theory of eternal change,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

Plato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', which is a treatment of the [[Theory of Forms|eternal forms]], ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'', which are the real aims for knowledge.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem "how one unchanging reality or essential{{clarify|date=July 2017}} being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion)."{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}}

In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato argues that the "real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,"{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} stating that the ''[[Form of the Good]]''{{refn|group=note|Identified by various commentators with the Form of Unity.{{explain|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}}} is the highest object of knowledge.{{sfn|Kahn|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}}{{refn|group=note|See ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 508d–e, 511b, 516b)}} His argument culminates in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}{{r|EoP_Plato(Republic)|group=web}} Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual{{refn|group=note|As opposed to mere rationality.}} understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the "first principles of all knowledge."{{sfn|Phillips|2008|p=234}}

According to Cook, the ''Theory of Forms'' has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus.{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} The pursuit of ''Truth, Beauty and Goodness'' became a central element in the apophatic tradition,{{sfn|Cook|2013|p=113}} but nevertheless, according to Carabine "Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way."{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21}} Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with "one transcendent source," an identification which his later interpreters made.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=21-22}}

===Middle Platonism===
{{Main|Middle Platonism}}

[[Middle Platonism]] (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE){{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} further investigated Plato's "Unwritten Doctrines," which drew on [[Pythagoras]]' first principles of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] and the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|Dyad]] (matter).{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} Middle Platonism proposed a [[hierarchy of being]], with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's ''Form of the Good''.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]] (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity.{{r|IEP_Middle_Platonism|group=web}} According to Craig D. Allert, "Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God."{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}} For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.{{sfn|Allert|2002|p=89}}

===Neo-Platonism===
{{Main|Neo-Platonism}}

Neo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which "developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism."{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted.{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to [[Gnosticism]].{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}} Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.{{r|IEP_Neo-Platonism|group=web}}

====Plotinus====
[[File:Plotinus.jpg|thumb|left|Plotinus]]
[[Plotinus]] (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} In the [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic philosophy]] of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' is the first principle, from which everything else emanates.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the ''Republic'', as the cause of the other Forms, with ''the One'' of the first hypothesis of the second part of the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]''.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} For Plotinus, ''the One'' precedes the [[Theory of Forms|Forms]],{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} and "is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being."{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} From ''the One'' comes the [[Nous|Intellect]], which contains all the Forms.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} ''The One'' is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such.{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of ''the One'',{{sfn|Gerson|2012}} which unites all existents "as a single, all-pervasive reality."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}}

''The One'' is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity.{{sfn|Mooney|2009|p=7}} Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the "presence of the intellect in the human soul,"{{refn|group=note|Compare Korean Chon (Zen) master [[Jinul]]s "tracing back the radiance":&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''"Question: What is the mind of void and calm, numinous awareness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinul: What has just asked me this question is precisely your mind of void and calm, numinous awareness. Why not trace back its radiance rather than search for it outside? For your benefit I will now point straight to your original mind so that you can awaken to it.

{{quote|Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul [...] To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One.}}

Carabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of ''the One'', but a means to ''[[Ecstasy (philosophy)|extasis]]'' and an ascent to "the unapproachable light that is God."{{r|Carabine_interview|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching ''[[henosis]]'',{{refn|group=note|The Neoplatonic concept of ''henosis'' has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}}}} concludes that "Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the "non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul," by "calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6)."{{r|IEP_Plotinus|group=web}} Pao-Shen Ho further notes that "for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} The argumentation about ''henosis'' is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when ''henosis'' has been attained.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to "bring his own soul and ''the souls of others'' by way of [[Nous|Intellect]] to union with the One."{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20}} As such, the ''Enneads'' as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to ''The Cloud of Unknowing'',{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=20-21}} demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=26}} Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.{{sfn|Ho|2015|p=25-27}}

====Proclus====
[[Proclus]] (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} He did this in the second book of his ''Platonic Theology'', arguing that Plato states that ''the One'' can be revealed "through analogy," and that "through negations [''dia ton apophaseon''] its transcendence over everything can be shown."{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=139}} For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from ''the One'', and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward ''the One'', while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to ''the One''.{{sfn|Louth|2012|p=140}} According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that "Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single [[Ineffability|ineffable]] [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle."{{sfn|Luz|2017|p=149}}

===Apostolic Age===
The [[Book of Revelation]] 8:1 mentions "the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven." According to Dan Merkur,
{{quote|The silence of the perpetual choir in heaven had mystical connotations, because silence attends the disappearance of plurality during experiences of mystical oneness. The term "silence" also alludes to the "still small voice" ([[1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Kings|19:12|HE|}}) whose [[theophany|revelation]] to [[Elijah]] on [[Mount Horeb]] rejected visionary imagery by affirming a negative theology.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=331}}{{refn|group=note|According to Michel Masson, Elijah's theophany is an "apophatic revelation," a mystical experience which is akin to ''nirvana'' and Böhme's ''Ungrund''."

===Early Church Fathers===
The [[Early Church Fathers]] were influenced by [[Philo of Alexandria|Philo]]{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=1}} (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw [[Moses]] as "the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the "luminous darkness" of God."{{sfn|Woloschak|2016}} His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, [[Origen]], the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}}

God's appearance to Moses in the [[burning bush]] was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers,{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}} especially [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (c. 335 – c. 395),{{sfn|Lane|2007|p=67}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}}{{sfn|Boersma|2013|p=243}} realizing the fundamental unknowability of God;{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Mayes|2016|p=117]}} an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition.{{sfn|Glasscoe|1992|p=57]}} Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since "following Christ is the human way of seeing God."{{sfn|Louth|2003|p=221}}

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology.{{sfn|Hägg|2006}}{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=545}} According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term ''theoria'' develops further from a mere intellectual "seeing" toward a spirutal form of contemplation.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of ''theoria'' and the "mystic vision of the soul."{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=88}} For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=89}} According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-92}} His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92}} According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=92-93}} ''Theoria'' and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.{{sfn|Baker|2000|p=98-103}}

According to [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240),
{{quote|[t]hat which is infinite is known only to itself.  This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions{{spndash}}our very incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is.  He is presented to our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], ''Apologeticus'', § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saint [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (313-386), in his ''[[Catechesis|Catechetical]] [[Homily|Homilies]]'', states:

===Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite===
Apophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of [[Proclus]] (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berthold |first1=George C. |title="Introduction" to Maximus the Confessor.

Dionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 17, in which [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] gives a [[Areopagus sermon|missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus]] in Athens.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} In {{bibleref2|Acts|17:23|KJV|verse 23}} Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the [[Unknown God]], "a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=12}} For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity.{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}} Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term "unknown God" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the "unknown God."{{sfn|Stang|2011|p=13}}

According to Corrigan and Harrington, "Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source."{{sfn|Corrigan|Harrington|2014}} Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|ascend to divinity]] as a process of purgation, illumination and union.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}} Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2010|p=439}}

[[John of Damascus]] (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the nature, but the things around the nature."

[[Maximus the Confessor]] (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&lt;ref name="Berthold1985_p9"/&gt; [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of [[Hesychasm]], the Orthodox practices of [[contemplative prayer]] and [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], "deification."

Influential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are [[Vladimir Lossky]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[John S. Romanides]] and [[Georges Florovsky]]. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the idea that [[mysticism]] is the expression of dogmatic theology ''par excellence''.&lt;ref&gt;Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through [[Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition]], such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even [[angel]]s) can understand. He is [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] in essence (''[[ousia]]''). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His [[Energies of God|indestructible energies]] through ''[[Christian contemplation|theoria]]'' (vision of God).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Lossky|Lossky, Vladimir]] (1997), ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'', Crestwood, N.Y.: [[SVS Press]], p. 81, {{ISBN|0-913836-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lossky (1997), ''The Vision of God'', Crestwood, N.Y.: SVS Press, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in his [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] or existences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle Papanikolaou|Papanikolaou, Aristotle]] (2006), ''Being With God: Trinity, Apophaticism, and Divine–Human Communion'' (1st Edition), Notre Dame, Indiana:[[University of Notre Dame Press]], p. 2, {{ISBN|978-0-268-03830-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christianity===
Negative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] wrote: 
{{quote|We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything [i.e., "not any created thing"]. Literally God ''is not'', because He [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] [[being]].''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=Eriugena+%22We+do+not+know+what+God+is.+God+Himself+does+not+know+what+He+is+because+He+is+not+anything.+Literally+God+is+not%2C+because+He+transcends+being%22 Quote] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he says "''He is not anything''" and "''God is not''", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is "other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Indick|first1=William|title=The Digital God.

Theologians like [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Saint John of the Cross]] (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and Saint John's ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'' are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the [[Catholic Church]], which, on the basis of [[Religious text#Christianity|Scripture]] and [[Sacred tradition|church tradition]], during the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Fourth Lateran Council]] formulated the following [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]]:

According to Adrian Langdon,
{{quote|The distinction between univocal, equivocal, and analogous language and relations corresponds to the distinction between the ''via positiva'', via ''negativa'', and ''via eminentiae''.

According to ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', the ''Doctor Angelicus'' and the [[Scholasticism|scholastici]] declare [that] 
{{quote|God is not absolutely unknowable, and yet it is true that we cannot define Him adequately. But we can conceive and name Him in an "analogical way". The perfections manifested by creatures are in God, not merely nominally (''equivoce'') but really and positively, since He is their source. Yet, they are not in Him as they are in the creature, with a mere difference of degree, nor even with a mere specific or generic difference (''univoce''), for there is no common concept including the finite and the Infinite. They are really in Him in a supereminent manner (''eminenter'') which is wholly incommensurable with their mode of being in creatures. We can conceive and express these perfections only by an analogy; not by an analogy of proportion, for this analogy rests on a participation in a common concept, and, as already said, there is no element common to the finite and the Infinite; but by an analogy of proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Sauvage |first=George |year=1907 |inline=1 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01449a.htm|title=Analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad [[analogies]] or false mind-pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brazier |first=P.

The mid-20th century Dutch philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friesen|first1=J. Glenn|title=The religious dialectic revisited|url=https://jgfriesen.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/revisited.pdf|website=jgfriesen.files|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature.&lt;ref name="VanDrunen"&gt;{{cite book |last=VanDrunen |first=David |title=Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms.

According to [[Deirdre Carabine]], negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s,{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i, viii}} resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.{{sfn|Carabine|2015|p=i-ii}}

According to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=4}} [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology.{{sfn|Fagenblat|2017|p=2}} According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Golan, "God, Man and Nietzsche: A Startling Dialogue between Judaism and Modern Philosophers" (New York: iUniverse, 2008), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian parallels==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|Shankara]]
There are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophical]] works which have apophatic themes include the [[Mukhya Upanishads|Principal Upanishads]] (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the [[Brahma Sutras]] (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], where Brahman is described as "[[neti neti]]" or "neither this, nor that".&lt;ref&gt;Tharaud, Barry. Emerson for the Twenty-First Century: Global Perspectives on an American Icon. Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp, 2010. p. 453. {{ISBN|978-0-87413-091-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:{{Quote|Whenever we deny something unreal, it is in reference to something real.&lt;ref&gt;Verse III.2.22, Brahma-Sutra, Translated by Swami Gambhirananda.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhist philosophy]] has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of [[anatta]] (not-[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]], not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. [[Madhyamaka]] is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by [[Nagarjuna]] (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness ([[Śūnyatā|shunyata]]). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the [[Prajnaparamita|prajñaparamita]] genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.

Apophatic movements in medieval [[Hindu philosophy]] are visible in the works of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] (8th century), a philosopher of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), and [[Bhartṛhari]] (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, [[Brahman]], is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Coward|Coward, Harold G.]] and Foshay, Toby. Derrida and Negative Theology. State University of New York, 1992. P. 21. {{ISBN|0-7914-0964-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita, Brahman is defined as being [[Nirguna]] or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, John.  Responses to One Hundred One Questions on Hinduism. Paulist Press, 1999. P. 75. {{ISBN|0-8091-3845-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taittiriya]] hymn speaks of Brahman as "one where the mind does not reach". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. 

Negative theology also figures in the [[Buddhist]] and Hindu [[polemics]]. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.

==Apophatic theology and atheism==
Even though the ''via negativa'' essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pondé|first1=Luiz Felipe|title=Crítica e profecia: a filosofia da religião em Dostoiévski |date=2003 |publisher=Editora 34 |location=São Paulo|pages=74–92|isbn=8573262842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of [[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]], since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology".{{sfn|Bryson|2016|p=114}} Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lonergan|Lonergan, Bernard]] (1972), "Method in Theology", New York, N.Y.: Seabury Press, {{ISBN|0-8164-2204-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the ''via negativa'' also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Buckley|Buckley, Michael J.]] (2004), "Denying and Disclosing God: The Ambiguous Progress of Modern Atheism", New Haven, C.T.: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 120ff, {{ISBN|0-30009384-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].

* 1990: [[Ashley Bickerton]] and [[Ronald Jones (Interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]] included in "Mind Over Matter: Concept and Object" exhibition of ”third generation Conceptual artists” at the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA113CF93AA25753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Brenson | title=Review/Art; In the Arena of the Mind, at the Whitney | date=19 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Abélard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Suárez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincaré's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant’s Conceptualism, and Kant’s Non-Conceptualism" – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41–64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4119">{{Chinese Legalism}}
'''Fa''' ({{zh|s=法}};{{IPA-cmn|fà}}) is a concept in [[Chinese philosophy]] that covers ethics, logic, and law. It can be translated as "law" in some contexts, but more often as "model" or "standard." First gaining importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought, the concept was principally elaborated in [[Chinese Legalism|Legalism]]. In [[Han Fei]]'s philosophy, the king is the sole source of ''fa'' (law), taught to the common people so that there would be a harmonious society free of chance occurrences, disorder, and "appeal to privilege". High officials were not to be held above ''fa'' (law or protocol), nor were they to be allowed to independently create their own ''fa'', uniting both [[Fiat (policy debate)|executive fiat]] and [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Han Fei. (2003). Basic Writings. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 7, 21- 28, 40, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], a philosopher that would end up being foundational in [[Han dynasty]] [[Confucianism]], also took up ''fa'', suggesting that it could only be properly assessed by the Confucian [[Sage (Sophos)|sage]] (ruler), and that the most important ''fa'' were the very rituals that Mozi had ridiculed for their ostentatious waste and lack of benefit for the people at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Robins |first=Dan |title=Xunzi |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Fall 2008 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/xunzi/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohism and the School of Names==
The concept of ''fa'' first gained importance in the [[Mohism|Mohist]] school of thought. To [[Mozi]], a standard must stand "three tests" in order to determine its efficacy and morality.&lt;ref name="University of Idaho Press"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/308/mozipp.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these tests was its origin; if the standard had precedence in the actions or thought of the semi-mythological [[Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors|sage kings]] of the [[Xia dynasty]] whose examples are frequently cited in classical Chinese philosophy. The second test was one of validity; does the model stand up to evidence in the estimation of the people? The third and final test was one of applicability; this final one is a [[utilitarian]] estimation of the net good that, if implemented, the standard would have on both the people and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Mozi. (2003). Basic Writings. Burton Watson, Ed. Columbia University Press: New York, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The third test speaks to the fact that to the Mohists, a ''fa'' was not simply an abstract model, but an active tool. The real-world use and practical application of ''fa'' were vital. Yet ''fa'' as models were also used in later Mohist logic as principles used in [[Inference|deductive]] reasoning. As classical Chinese philosophical logic was based on [[analogy]] rather than [[syllogism]], ''fa'' were used as benchmarks to determine the validity of logical claims through comparison. There were three ''fa'' in particular that were used by these later Mohists (or "[[School of Names|Logicians]]") to assess such claims, which were mentioned earlier. The first was considered a "root" standard, a concern for precedence and origin. The second, a "source", a concern for [[empiricism]]. The third, a "use", a concern for the [[Consequentialism|consequence]] and pragmatic utility of a standard. These three ''fa'' were used by the Mohists to both promote social welfare and denounce ostentation or wasteful spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Chris |title=Mohism |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2010 |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/mohism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">According to the '''growing block universe theory of time''' (or the '''growing block view'''), the past and present exist and the future does not exist. The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of [[spacetime]], where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.

The growing block view is an alternative to both [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to [[common sense|common-sense]] intuitions than the alternatives. [[C. D. Broad]] was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are [[Michael Tooley]] (in 1997) and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] (in 2004).

==Criticism==
Recently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and [[Trenton Merricks]] have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of "now" is an [[indexical]] and the second occurrence of "now" is the [[objective tensed property]]. Their observation implies the following sentence: "This part of spacetime has the property of being present".)

Take [[Socrates]] discussing, in the past, with [[Gorgias]], and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being.  But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.

However, some{{who|date=October 2017}} have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.

'''Hume's fork''' is an explanation, developed by later [[philosopher]]s, of [[David Hume]]'s 1730s division of "relations of ideas" from "matters of fact and real existence".&lt;ref name=Flew&gt;[[Antony Flew]], ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Hume's+fork p 156].&lt;/ref&gt;  A distinction is made between [[Modal logic|necessary]] versus [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] (concerning reality), {{nowrap|''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]''}} versus {{nowrap|''[[a posteriori]]''}} (concerning knowledge), and [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]] versus [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] (concerning language). Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, ''a priori'', analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, ''a posteriori'', synthetic).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

The "necessary" is generally true in all [[possible world]]s—usually by mere logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]—whereas the "contingent" hinges on the way the real world is.  The ''a priori'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''a posteriori'' is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The "analytic" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the "synthetic" is true by its terms' [[semantics|meanings]] in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Georges|title=The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition)|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. 

==History&lt;!--'Kant's pitchfork' redirects here--&gt;==
Hume's strong [[empiricism]], as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's [[problem of induction]], was taken as a threat to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion.  [[Immanuel Kant]] responded with [[rationalism]] in his 1781 ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those [[sense data]] into the experience of space and time.  Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic ''a priori''—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis ('''Kant's pitchfork'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant and the Foundations of Analytic Philosophy''. Clarendon Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus saving [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

[[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|In 1919]], Newton's theory fell to Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. In the late 1920s, the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] rejected Kant's synthetic ''a priori'' and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a [[logical syntax]] entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims [[verificationism|verifiable]] as either [[truth value|false or true]].  In the early 1950s, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating [[ontological relativity]], as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  By the early 1970s, [[Saul Kripke]] established the necessary ''a posteriori'', since if the [[Venus|Morning Star]] and the [[Venus|Evening Star]] are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy.  Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the [[No true Scotsman|''No true Scotsman'' move]].  Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin &amp; Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork".  ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.  Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, ''Bacon to Kant: An Introduction to Modern Philosophy'', 2nd Edition, p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hume's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork". ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as [[David Hume#Practical reason|beliefs versus desires]] and as impressions versus ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section II.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, ''relations of ideas'', and ''matters of fact''. Of the first kind are the sciences of [[Geometry]], [[Algebra]], and [[Arithmetic]] ...'' [which are] ''discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt; ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section IV, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]], [[Modal logic|necessary]], and [[knowledge|knowable]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], and knowable ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as [[analytic proposition]]s and members of the latter as [[synthetic proposition]]s. This terminology comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (Introduction to ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as ''"all bodies are extended"'', ''"all bachelors are unmarried"'', and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like ''"the sun rises in the morning"'', and ''"all bodies have mass"''.

Hume wants to prove that [[certainty]] does not exist in science.  First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern [[brain in a vat]] theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: "Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls." While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length." While some earlier philosophers (most notably [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]]) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the [[existence of God]] (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement "God exists," it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we take in our hand any volume; of [[divinity]] or school [[metaphysics]], for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166|ps=, emphasis removed}} — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

{{Distinguish|Landau principle}}
'''Landauer's principle''' is a [[Principle#Principle as scientific law|physical principle]] pertaining to the lower [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] limit of [[Energy conservation|energy consumption]] of [[computation]]. It holds that "any logically irreversible manipulation of [[Information#As a property in physics|information]], such as the erasure of a [[bit]] or the merging of two [[computation]] paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding [[entropy]] increase in non-information-bearing [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the information-processing apparatus or its environment".&lt;ref name = bennett&gt;{{Citation |arxiv=physics/0210005 |title=Notes on Landauer's principle, Reversible Computation and Maxwell's Demon |authorlink=Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist) |author=Charles H. Bennett |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=501–510 |year=2003 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(03)00039-X|bibcode=2003SHPMP..34..501B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

'''Logic models''' are hypothesized descriptions of the chain of causes and effects (see [[Causality]]) leading to an outcome of interest (e.g. prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, annual traffic collision, etc). While they can be in a narrative form, logic model usually take form in a graphical depiction of the "if-then" (causal) relationships between the various elements leading to the outcome. However, the logic model is more than the graphical depiction: it is also the theories, scientific evidences, assumptions and beliefs that support it and the various processes behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Renger R |date=2002|title=A Three-Step Approach to Teaching Logic Models |journal=The American Journal of Evaluation |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=493–503 |doi=10.1016/s1098-2140(02)00230-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Frechtling_2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frechtling|first=Joy A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Logic Models|date=2015 |work=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|pages=299–305|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.10549-5|isbn=978-0-08-097087-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the logic model ==

===Program planning===
One of the most important uses of the logic model is for program planning. It is suggested to use the logic model to focus on the intended outcomes of a particular program. The guiding questions change from "what is being done?" to "what needs to be done"? McCawley suggests that by using this new reasoning, a logic model for a program can be built by asking the following questions in sequence:

# What is the current situation that we intend to impact?
# What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?
# What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?
# What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?
# What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?
# What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~kgilbert/educ5165-731/Readings/The%20Logic%20Model.pdf|title=The logic model for program planning and evaluation|last=McCawley|first=Paul F. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of Idaho Extension|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By placing the focus on ultimate outcomes or results, planners can ''think backward'' through the logic model to identify how best to achieve the desired results. Here it helps managers to 'plan with the end in mind', rather than just consider inputs (e.g. budgets, employees) or the tasks that must be done.

===Evaluation===
The logic model is often used in [[government]] or not-for-profit organizations, where the mission and vision are not aimed at achieving a financial benefit. Traditionally, government programs were described only in terms of their [[budget]]s.  It is easy to measure the amount of money spent on a program, but this is a poor indicator of outcomes. Likewise it is relatively easy to measure the amount of work done (e.g. number of workers or number of years spent), but the workers may have just been 'spinning their wheels' without getting very far in terms of ultimate results or outcomes.

However, nature of outcomes varies. To measure the progress toward outcomes, some initiatives may require an ad hoc measurement instrument. In addition, in programs such as in [[education]] or [[social program]]s, outcomes are usually in the long-term and may requires numerous intermediate changes (attitudes, social norm, industry practices, etc.) to advance progressively toward the outcomes.

By making clear the intended outcomes and the causal pathways leading to them, a program logic model provides the basis upon which planners and evaluators can develop a measurement plan and adequate instruments. Instead of only looking at the outcome progress, planners can open the "black box" and examine if the intermediate outcomes progress as planned. In addition, the pathways of numerous outcomes are still largely misunderstood due their complexity, their unpredictability and lack of scientific / practical evidences. Therefore, with proper research design, one may not only assess the progress of intermediate outcomes, but evaluate as well if the program theory of change is accurate, i.e. is successful change of an intermediate outcomes provokes the hypothesized subsequent effects in the causal pathway. Finally, outcomes may easily be achieved through processes independent of the program and an evaluation of those outcomes would suggest program success when in fact external outputs were responsible for the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Rossi | first2 = Mark W | last2 = Lipsey | first3 = Howard E | last3 = Freeman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evaluation : a systematic approach |date=2004|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4|edition=7th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |oclc=52706526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Various types of logic models ==

=== The Inputs --&gt; Activities --&gt; Outputs --&gt; Outcomes template ===
Many authors and guides use the following template when speaking about logic model:&lt;ref name="Frechtling_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LM_EE" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McLaughlin |first=John A. |last2=Jordan |first2=Gretchen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Using Logic Models |date=2015-10-14 |work=Handbook of Practical Program Evaluation |pages=62–87 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/9781119171386.ch3 |isbn=978-1-119-17138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Many refinements and variations{{Which|date=October 2018}} have been added to the basic template. For example, many versions of logic models set out a series of outcomes/impacts, explaining in more detail the logic of how an intervention contributes to intended or observed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Weiss CH | date = 1972 | title = Evaluation Research. Methods for Assessing Program Effectiveness. | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc. | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others often distinguish short-term, medium-term and long-term results, and between direct and indirect results.

=== Intervention Mapping logic models ===
[[File:Logic_Model_of_the_Problem_for_Management_information_Decision_Support_Epilepsy_Tool.jpg|thumb|Logic Model of the Problem for Management information Decision Support Epilepsy Tool (MINDSET program) from Ruiter, DeSmet and Schneider (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shegog R, Begley CE | title = Clinic-Based Mobile Health Decision Support to Enhance Adult Epilepsy Self-Management: An Intervention Mapping Approach | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 5 | pages = 256 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29043247 | pmc = 5632356 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2017.00256 | quote = The full intervention mapping based protocol is available in the full article }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bartholomew et al. [[Intervention mapping|Intervention Mapping]] approach&lt;ref name="Eldredge_2016" /&gt; makes an extensive use of logic model through the whole life-cycle of a health promotion program. Since this method can start from as far as a vague desired outcomes (authors example is a city whose actors decide to address "health issues" of the city), planners goes through various steps in order to develop effective interventions and properly evaluate them (see [[Intervention Mapping]] entry for a more detailed account). Distinguishable but closely interweave logic models with different purposes are being developed through the process:

* '''Logic model of the problem''', which is a graphical depiction of at-risk population and its social environment behaviours (factors) leading to the health problem and their respective causal pathways (attitudes, beliefs, skills, etc.). This may include as well at-risk population physical environment related causes such as polluants or lack of physical activity infrastructure and their respective causes, i.e. environmental agents behaviours leading to the physical environment causes and their respective causal pathways;
* Once the most relevant behaviours and causal pathways are identified, planners develop a '''logic model of change'''. This is a model of behavioural changes (performance objective) that should happen and their corresponding necessary changes higher in the cause-effects chain.
* Finally, a '''logic model of the intervention''' is developed. This model describe the various activities that will happen and the cascades of effects they are expected to cause toward the desired outcome.

Evaluators thereafter use the logic model of the intervention to design a proper evaluation plan to assess [[Program evaluation#Assessing implementation|implementation]], [[Program evaluation#Assessing the impact (effectiveness)|impact]] and [[Program evaluation#Assessing efficiency|efficiency]].

==Advantages==
By describing work in this way, managers have an easier way to define the work and measure it.  [[Performance measurement|Performance measures]] can be drawn from any of the steps.  One of the key insights of the logic model is the importance of measuring final outcomes or results, because it is quite possible to waste time and money (inputs), "spin the wheels" on work activities, or produce outputs without achieving desired outcomes.  It is these outcomes (impacts, long-term results) that are the only justification for doing the work in the first place.  For commercial organizations, outcomes relate to [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].  For [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] or [[governmental organization]]s, outcomes relate to successful achievement of mission or program goals.

==Disadvantages==
There are some potential disadvantages of logic models due to tendencies toward oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The logic model guidebook : better strategies for great results | first1 = Lisa Wyatt | last1 = Knowlton | first2 = Cynthia C | last2 = Phillips | last3 =Phillips | first3 = Cynthia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|publisher=SAGE C.|isbn=978-1-4522-1675-1|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles|oclc=791492618}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
#Program logic is no guarantee of actual logic in how the program may work. The world is complex, and some situations cannot be ascertained before they are implemented, so some programs may even progress against the "logic" of the model.
#It is a partial representation of a complex system.
#It is a representation of reality, not reality itself. Programs are not linear
#Normally, it does not include effects besides those initially expected.
#They do not necessarily establish causality. Many factors exert influence upon the effects.

In [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] theory, the '''Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution''' ('''MRTS''')—or '''Technical Rate of Substitution''' ('''TRS''')—is the amount by which the quantity of one input has to be reduced (&lt;math&gt;-\Delta x_2&lt;/math&gt;) when one extra unit of another input is used (&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;), so that output remains constant (&lt;math&gt;y = \bar{y}&lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;math&gt;MRTS(x_1,x_2) =-\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1} = \frac{MP_1}{MP_2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;MP_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;MP_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[marginal product]]s of input 1 and input 2, respectively.

Along an [[isoquant]], the MRTS shows the rate at which one input (e.g. capital or labor) may be substituted for another, while maintaining the same level of output. Thus the MRTS is the absolute value of the slope of an isoquant at the point in question.

When relative input usages are optimal, the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal to the relative unit costs of the inputs, and the slope of the isoquant at the chosen point equals the slope of the [[isocost|isocost curve]] (see [[Conditional factor demands]]). It is the rate at which one input is substituted for another to maintain the same level of output.

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal revenue''' (R') is the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by one unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"&gt;Edwin Mansfield, "Micro-Economics Theory and Applications, 3rd Edition", New York and London:W.W. Norton and Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"&gt;Tirole, Jean,  "The Theory of Industrial Organization", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"&gt;John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be described as the [[total revenue|unit revenue]] the last item sold has generated for the firm.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;  In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan &amp; Sheffrin (2003), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because a firm in a [[perfect competition|competitive market]] will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; However, a [[monopoly]] determines the entire [[industry]]'s sales.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;  As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  The marginal revenue (the increase in [[total revenue]]) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. 

A firms profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals [[Marginal cost|marginal cost (MC)]]. If &lt;math&gt;MR &gt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should increase output for more profits, if &lt;math&gt;MR &lt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should decrease output for additional profits. A firm should choose the output level which is profit maximizing under perfect competition theory &lt;math&gt;MR = MC&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/432989728|title=Managerial economics : a strategic approach|last=David.|first=Prentice,|last2=1962-|first2=Waschik, Robert G.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415495172|location=|pages=33|oclc=432989728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small.  More formally, define the revenue function to be the following
:&lt;math&gt;R(q)=P(q)\cdot q &lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[product rule]], marginal revenue is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;R'(q)=P(q) + P'(q)\cdot q&lt;/math&gt;.

For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)=0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a [[monopoly]], the price decreases with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;).

==Marginal revenue curve==

The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S Price 2002. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity==
The relationship between marginal revenue and the [[price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]] by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R' = \frac{dR}{dQ} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle + \left( \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \right) Q &lt;/math&gt;
:as &lt;math&gt; \langle R \rangle = P &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle \left[ 1 + \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \frac{Q}{\langle R \rangle} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle (1 + 1 / e_{\langle R \rangle})&lt;/math&gt;

where e is the [[price elasticity of demand]]. If demand is inelastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1) then R' will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price.

==Marginal revenue and rule-of-thumb pricing==
Profit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.

:R' = C' 
:R' = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt; + &lt;R&gt;/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
:(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand.&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"/&gt; Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as:
:&lt;R&gt; = C'/(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus if e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is - 2 and mc is $5.00 then price is $10.00.

(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost.  The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic.&lt;ref name="Perloff"/&gt;

'''Example'''
If a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">As defined by the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]] the '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful''ness'' of the marginal use thus corresponds to the [[marginal utility]] of the good or service.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that an agent is [[Rational choice theory|economically rational]], each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein" /&gt;  And, in the absence of a complementarity across uses, [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|the “law” of diminishing marginal utility]] will obtain.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; “Utility”, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

The Austrian School of economics explicitly arrives at its conception of marginal utility as the utility of the marginal use, and “Grenznutzen” (the Austrian School term from which “marginal utility” was originally derived in translation&lt;ref&gt;Streissler, E., “Wieser, Friedrich, Freiherr von”, [[The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4  (1987), p. 921.&lt;/ref&gt;) literally means ''border-use''; other schools usually do not make an explicit connection.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic.

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

The mental model theory of reasoning was developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991). It has been applied to the main domains of deductive inference including relational inferences such as spatial and temporal deductions; propositional inferences, such as conditional, disjunctive and negation deductions; quantified inferences such as syllogisms; and meta-deductive inferences.

Ongoing research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led the theory to be extended to account for probabilistic inference (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 2006) and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] discussed the method of loci in his ''[[De Oratore]]''.]]
The '''method of loci''' (''loci'' being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. The method of loci is also known as the '''memory journey''', '''memory palace''', or '''mind palace technique'''. This method is a [[mnemonic]] device  adopted in [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Oratore]]'', and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''). Many [[Memory sport|memory contest]] champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

The term is most often found in specialised works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[Lynn Nadel]] refer to:&lt;blockquote&gt;'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by [[Frances Yates|Yates]] (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.&lt;ref name="cognitivemap"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = O'Keefe| first1 =John |last2 = Nadel |first2 =Lynn| authorlink2 = Lynn Nadel  | title =The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = December 7, 1978| location = Oxford|url =http://www.cognitivemap.net | isbn = 978-0198572060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Roman Room Technique| work = AcademicTips.org| url =http://www.academictips.org/memory/romanrom.html| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Many effective memorisers today use the "method of loci" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the [[World Memory Championship]], was initiated in 1991 and the first [[USA Memory Championship|United States championship]] was held in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Foer| first =Joshua| authorlink =Joshua Foer| title =Forget Me Not: How to win the U.S. memory championship| work =[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = March 16, 2005| url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html| accessdate = October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to [[long-term memory]] a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, "stop" at each locus, and "observe" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.

Memory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time [[World Memory Champion]] [[Dominic O'Brien]] uses this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 1997 World Memory Championships| work = Mind Sports Worldwide| url =http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121614/http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Town_System_for_Languages|title=Memory Town System for Languages - Memory Techniques Wiki|author=|date=|website=mt.artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[World Memory Champion]], [[Clemens Mayer]], used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in "number half marathon", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise [[pi]] to over 65,536 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Using this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. {{cn|date=September 2017}} The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 5 Minute Speed Cards| work = World Memory Statistics| publisher = World Memory Sports Council| url =http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/discipline.php?id=spdcards| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - Coursera|author=|date=|website=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:
# Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and
# Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.

The method of loci has also been shown to help sufferers of [[Major depressive disorder | depression]] remember positive, self-affirming memories.&lt;ref name="Dagleish"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalgleish |first=Tim |last2=Navrady |first2=Lauren |last3=Bird |first3=Elinor |last4=Hill |first4=Emma |last5=Dunn |first5=Barnaby D. |last6=Golden |first6=Ann-Marie |date=12 February 2013 |title=Method-of-Loci as a Mnemonic Device to Facilitate Access to Self-Affirming Personal Memories for Individuals With Depression |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702612468111 |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |doi=10.1177/2167702612468111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Maryland evaluated participants ability to accurately recall two sets of familiar faces, using a traditional desktop, and with a head-mounted display. The study was designed to leverage the method of loci technique, with virtual environments resembling memory palaces. The study found an 8.8% recall improvement in favor of the head-mounted display, in part due to participants being able to leverage their vestibular and proprioceptive sensations.&lt;ref name="EKrokos"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Krokos|first=Eric|last2=Plaisant|first2=Catherine|last3=Varshney|first3=Amitabh |date=16 May 2018|title=Virtual Memory Palaces: Immersion Aids Recall|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with [[elaborative encoding]] (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium Passages on Memory|first=Douglas Boin/Karl|last=Galinsky|date=|website=www.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/quintillian-on-memory-109.html|title=Quintilian on Memory - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=25 November 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.

A variation of the "method of loci" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bremer| first = Rod| title =The Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM)| publisher =  Fons Sapientiae Publishing | date = September 20, 2011| location = Cambridge, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0956990709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/memory-techniques-brazilian-portuguese-795.html|title=New Project: Use Memory Techniques to Learn Brazilian Portuguese - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=18 December 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something that is likely a reference to the "method of loci" techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finger| first =Stanley| title =Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = October 11, 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 333 | isbn = 978-0195146943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/first-place-second-place-5806.html|title="In the First Place, in the Second Place" - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=12 January 2015|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot [[Timothy Doner]] described in his 2014 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donor|first1=Timothy|title=Breaking the language barrier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book "How to learn and memorise German vocabulary". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.

==Applicability of the term==
The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the [[art of memory]], [[Art of memory#Origins and history|the origins of which are related]], according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]] and the collapsing banquet hall.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from [[The Art of Memory|Frances Yates]]) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the [[art of memory]]. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gutman| first =Sharon A.| title =Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals| publisher = SLACK Incorporated| date = December 1, 2007 |location =Thorofare, New Jersey| pages = 216| isbn =978-1556428005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the [[art of memory]], hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.

== Spatial mnemonics and specific brain activation ==

Brain scans of "superior memorizers", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the [[Parietal lobe|medial parietal cortex]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], and the [[Hippocampus|right posterior hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation.  In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.

In a classic study in cognitive [[neuroscience]], O'Keefe and Nadel proposed "that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated."&lt;ref This theory has generated considerable debate and further experiment. It has been noted that "[t]he hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal [[neurons]] supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fictional portrayals ==
Fictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myths]]. The method of loci also features prominently in the [[BBC]] series  ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in which the titular main character uses a "mind palace" to store information. In the original [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] stories, [[Sherlock Holmes]] referred to his [[brain]] as an [[attic]].&lt;ref name="Zielinski18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=The Secrets of Sherlock’s Mind Palace|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/secrets-sherlocks-mind-palace-180949567/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Smithsonian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], a detailed description of [[Hannibal Lecter]]'s memory palace is provided.&lt;ref name="harris-thomas-hanibal-rising"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris|first=Thomas|year=2006|title=[[Hannibal Rising]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|isbn=0385339410|pages=1-2,167,178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinez-conde-susana-sciam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez-Conde|first=Susana|title=Neuroscience in Fiction: Hannibal Lecter's Memory Palace|date=April 26, 2013|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">'''Model worker''' ({{zh|s=劳动模范|p=láodòng mófàn}}, abbreviated as 劳模 or '''''láomó''''') is a Communist Chinese political term referring to an exemplary worker who exhibits some or all of the traits appropriate to the ideal of the socialist worker. The idea is similar to the Soviet [[Stakhanovite]] icon.  Model workers are selected in China by central and provincial-level departments. Some cities and large companies also have processes for selecting and praising model workers.

The basic criteria for model workers are [[patriotism]], "worship of science," activities in [[environmental protection]], and the pursuit of excellence.

Model workers are often afforded privileges not available to other citizens or [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] members. "The possibility to become a model worker offered peasants and workers one of the few opportunities for upward mobility other than joining the army," writes scholar Yu Miin-lin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949-Present (The Harvard Cold War Studies Book Series)|last = Li &amp; Bernstein|first = Hua-Yu &amp; Thomas P.|publisher = Lexington Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0739142232|location = |pages = 254|chapter = “Labor Is Glorious”: Model Laborers in the People's Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model workers have an easier time joining the Communist Party, and also to become a higher-level cadre, manager, or other leader.

==Notable model workers==
[[File:Hao Jianxiu in textile mill.jpg|thumb|[[Hao Jianxiu]], model worker in 1951]]
One of the earliest model workers was the teenage textile worker [[Hao Jianxiu]] (awarded 1951), who invented the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method". She was sent to study at [[East China Textile Engineering Institute]] and was elevated to the upper echelon of Chinese politics, serving as Minister of Textile Industry, secretary of the [[CPC Central Secretariat]], and vice chair of the [[National Development and Reform Commission|State Planning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Lily Xiao Hong |last2=Stefanowska |first2=A.

He was elevated to leadership positions in the municipal governments of [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Tianjin]], and became a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]]. He also served as Chairman of the [[All-China Federation of Trade Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2013/0503/c1001-21348753.html |script-title=zh:倪志福同志生平 |trans-title=Biography of Ni Zhifu |work=People's Daily |date=3 May 2013 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Negative campaigning''' or '''mudslinging''' is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the [[public relations|public image]] of the described.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of  winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.

The public image of an entity can be defined as [[reputation]], esteem, [[respect]], acceptance of the entity's appearance, [[values]] and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a [[social group]], possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged,  in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In [[polygamous]] societies [[monogamy]] is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in [[Western culture]] was considered immoral and was [[Homosexuality#Legality|criminally prosecuted]] until the [[sexual revolution]] of the second half of the 20 century.
Thus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the [[Old Testament]] and other traditional religious societies [[adultery]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.

In [[United States politics]], negative campaigning has been called "as [[American way of life|American]] as Mississippi mud" and "as American as apple pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The modern presidential campaign: Mudslinging, bombast, and the vitality of American politics|last = Scher|first = R. K.|publisher = M. E. Sharpe|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/russian5.pdf|title=The Rational Attacker in Russia?

== Techniques ==

There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning.  Among the most effective is running [[advertisement]]s attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion.  There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent.  There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent.  Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent.  Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"&gt;Fridkin, K. L., &amp; Kenney, P. J. (2004). Do Negative Messages Work?: The Impact of Negativity on Citizens’ Evaluations of Candidates. American Politics Research, 32(570), 570–602. {{doi|10.1177/1532673X03260834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent.  The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative.  Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent.  Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"/&gt;

One of the most famous such ads was ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy Girl]]'' by the campaign of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that successfully portrayed Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] as threatening [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as [[lobbying|lobby groups]], to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] by allegedly independent bodies like [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

[[Push poll]]s are attacks disguised as [[Robo call#Political calls|telephone polls]]. They might ask a question like "How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

[[G. Gordon Liddy]] played a major role in developing these tactics during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the [[campaign of 1972]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[James Carville]], campaign manager of [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Lee Atwater]], best known for being an advisor to presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Political Legacy of Baaad Boy Atwater | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | date=September 20, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support [[mass communication]] of negative ideas. The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by [[tobacco companies]], or to discourage [[drunk driving]]. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

[[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin Wattenberg]] and [[Craig Brians]], of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and [[Shanto Iyengar]] in 1995&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"&gt;Ansolabehere, S. &amp; Iyengar, S. (1995). Going negative: How campaign advertising shrinks and polarizes the electorate. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. [[Rick Farmer]], PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the [[University of Akron]] found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622031838/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-22 |title=Sock it to 'em: can a negative marketing campaign have positive results? Here's what to know before you strike the first blow &amp;#124; Entrepreneur &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests negative campaigning introduces controversy and raises public awareness through additional news coverage&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.ucr.edu/news/SWET/Garrett_Asay.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323181046/http://www.economics.ucr.edu/news/SWET/Garrett_Asay.pdf |date=March 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, [[Kyle Mattes]] and [[David P. Redlawsk]] in ''The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning'' show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing [[voter turnout]] and radicalizing politics.&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"/&gt; 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization.  While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.&lt;ref name="Garramone 1990"&gt;Garramone, G. M., Atkin, C. K., Pinkleton, B. E., &amp; Cole, R. T. (1990, Summer). Effects of Negative Political Advertising on the Political Process. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 34(3), 299–311. {{doi|10.1080/08838159009386744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative ads can produce a backlash. A [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|disastrous ad]] was run by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 Canadian federal election]], apparently emphasizing [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Bell's Palsy]] partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] for running an [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|attack ad]] that suggested that [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence "we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of "whoever the idiot who approved that ad was," shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in [[Afghanistan]] at the time.  (See [[Canadian federal election, 2006]])

More recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in [[North Carolina]], Republican incumbent [[Elizabeth Dole]] attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger [[Kay Hagan]], who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to [[atheists]]. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying "There is no God!" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the [[2008 financial crisis]]). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be "going negative," with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013318/http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the [[University of Delaware]], in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at [[Texas Tech University]], and Sungkyoung Lee of [[Indiana University]], which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the "startle response," the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545187/ Viewers Are Repulsed by Negative Campaign Ads] Newswise, Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10630">'''Negative consequentialism''' is a version of the ethical theory [[consequentialism]], which is "one of the major theories of [[normative ethics]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|2013|page=vii}}: "Consequentialism is one of the major theories of normative ethics."&lt;/ref&gt; Like other versions of consequentialism, negative consequentialism holds that moral right and wrong depend only on the value of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bykvist|2009|page=19}}: "The whole family of utilitarian theories is captured by the equation: Utilitarianism = Consequentialism (nothing but the values of outcomes matter for the rightness of actions) + Welfarism (nothing but well-being matters for the value of outcomes)."&lt;/ref&gt; That is, for negative and other versions of consequentialism, questions such as "what should I do?" and "what kind of person should I be?" are answered only based on consequences. Negative consequentialism differs from other versions of consequentialism by giving greater weight in moral deliberations to what is bad (e.g. suffering or injustice) than what is good (e.g. happiness or justice).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “Negative consequentialism is the version of consequentialism that focuses on reducing harms. It has this focus because it assumes that there aren’t things of positive intrinsic value, while there are things of negative intrinsic value. Therefore, in deciding on whether to act in a particular way, a negative consequentialist would consider what harms it would cause, eliminate, increase or decrease.”
{{harvnb|Arrhenius|Bykvist|1995|p=115}}: “Our point of departure was the firm intuition that unhappiness and suffering have greater weight than happiness. By taking this stand we revealed ourselves as members of the negative utilitarian family.”
{{harvnb|Ord|2013}}: “NU [negative utilitarianism] comes in several flavours, which I will outline later, but the basic thrust is that an act is morally right if and only if it leads to less suffering than any available alternative. Unlike Classical Utilitarianism, positive experiences such as pleasure or happiness are either given no weight, or at least a lot less weight. (In what follows, I use the word 'happiness' to stand in for whatever aspects of life might be thought to have positive value).”
&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific type of consequentialism is [[utilitarianism]], which says that the consequences that matter are those that affect well-being.{{sfn|Bykvist|2009|page=19}} Consequentialism is broader than utilitarianism in that consequentialism can say that the value of outcomes depend on other things than well-being; for example, justice, fairness, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|Mason|Miller|2000|page=2}}: “Other consequentialist theories take other things to be valuable, for example justice, fairness, and equality.”&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negative utilitarianism]] is thus a form of negative consequentialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “One form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism.”&lt;/ref&gt; Much more has been written explicitly about [[negative utilitarianism]] than directly about negative consequentialism, although since negative utilitarianism is a form of negative consequentialism, everything that has been written about negative utilitarianism is by definition about a specific (utilitarian) version of negative consequentialism. Similarly to how there are many variations of consequentialism and negative utilitarianism, there are many versions of negative consequentialism, for example negative [[prioritarianism]] and negative consequentialist [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Animal Ethics, Inc.|Negative Consequentialism}}: “According to negative consequentialism such as negative prioritarianism, negative utilitarianism, and negative consequentialist egalitarianism...”&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. E. Moore]]'s ethics can be said to be a negative consequentialism (more precisely, a consequentialism with a negative utilitarian component), because he has been labeled a consequentialist,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1995|page=46}}: “Moore is indeed a consequentialist.”&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that "consciousness of intense pain is, by itself, a great evil"{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=213}} whereas "the mere consciousness of pleasure, however intense, does not, ''by itself'', appear to be a ''great'' good, even if it has some slight intrinsic value. In short, pain (if we understand by this expression, the consciousness of pain) appears to be a far worse evil than pleasure is a good."{{sfn|Moore|1951 |p=212}} Moore wrote in the first half of the 20th century before any of the terms 'consequentialism,' 'negative utilitarianism' or 'negative consequentialism' were coined, and he did not use the term 'negative consequentialism' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore died in 1958; the same year that both of the terms 'consequentialism' and 'negative utilitarianism' seem to have been coined. According to {{harvnb|Spielthenner|2005|page=231}}, "It seems that the term 'consequentialism' has been coined by E. Anscombe in her influential article 'Modern Moral Philosophy' (1958)." {{harvnb|Smart|1958}} is widely considered to have coined the term 'negative utilitarianism.'&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Moore, [[Ingemar Hedenius]] defended a consequentialism that could be called negative (or could be said to have a negative utilitarian component) because he assigned more importance to suffering than to happiness. Hedenius saw the worst in life, such as infernalistic suffering, as so evil that calculations of happiness versus suffering becomes unnecessary; he did not see that such evil could be counterbalanced by any good, such as happiness.{{sfn|Petersson|2009}}

Philosophy professor Clark Wolf defends "negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2009|page=360}}: "For a defence of a negative consequentialism as a component of a larger theory of justice, see Wolf (1999)." That is, see {{harvnb|Wolf|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] interprets [[Bernard Gert]]'s moral system as a "sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism."{{sfn|Sinnott-Armstrong|2002|p=147}} Jamie Mayerfeld argues for a strong duty to relieve suffering, which is consequentialist in form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=116}}: "The duty to relieve suffering, I have suggested, arises from the badness of suffering." {{harvnb|Mayerfeld|1999|page=117}}: "The duty to relieve suffering is consequentialist in form."&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "suffering is more bad than happiness is good,"{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=136}} and that "the lifelong bliss of many people, no matter how many, cannot justify our allowing the lifelong torture of one."{{sfn|Mayerfeld|1999|p=178}}

'''Negative luminescence''' is a physical phenomenon by which an electronic device emits less [[thermal radiation]] when an [[electric current]] is passed through it than it does in [[thermal equilibrium]] (current off). When viewed by a [[thermal camera]], an operating negative luminescent device looks colder than its environment.

== Physics ==
Negative luminescence is most readily observed in [[semiconductor]]s. Incoming [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed in the material by the creation of an [[electron–hole pair]]. An [[electric field]] is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before they have a chance to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.

Negative luminescence has also been observed in semiconductors in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the junction of a diode is not necessary and the effect can be observed in bulk material. A term that has been applied to this type of negative luminescence is ''galvanomagnetic luminescence''.

Negative luminescence might appear to be a violation of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]. This is not true, as the law only applies in [[thermal equilibrium]].

Another term that has been used to describe negative luminescent devices is "[[Emissivity]] switch", as an electric current changes the effective emissivity.

== History ==
This effect was first seen by Russian physicists in the 1960s in A.F.Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, Leningrad, Russia. Subsequently, it was studied in [[semiconductors]] such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), [[germanium]] (Ge) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) by workers in [[West Germany]], [[Ukraine]] (Institute of Semiconductor Physics, [[Kiev]]), Japan ([[Chiba University]]) and the United States. It was first observed in the mid-infrared (3-5 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) in the more convenient [[diode]] structures in InSb [[heterostructure]] diodes by workers at the [[Defence Research Agency]], [[Great Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (now [[QinetiQ]]). These British workers later demonstrated LWIR band (8-12&amp;nbsp;µm) negative luminescence using [[HgCdTe|mercury cadmium telluride]] [[diode]]s.

Later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington DC]], started work on negative luminescence in [[mercury cadmium telluride]] (HgCdTe). The phenomenon has since been observed by several university groups around the world.

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goodman's construction and use of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in [[analytic philosophy|conceptual analysis]].

==Grue and bleen defined==
Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

'''Nonsense''' is a [[Linguistics|communication]], via [[speech]], [[writing]], or any other [[symbolic system]], that lacks any coherent [[semantics|meaning]]. Sometimes in ordinary usage, nonsense is synonymous with [[absurdity]] or the [[ridiculous]]. Many [[poet]]s, [[novelist]]s and [[songwriter]]s have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from [[sense]] or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a [[coherence (linguistics)|coherent]] and [[consistent]] method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in [[cryptography]] regarding separating a [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].

[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]
{{Main|Literary nonsense}}
The phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" was coined by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with [[poetic symbolism]]. The individual ''words'' make sense and are arranged according to proper [[grammar|grammatical rules]], yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of [[contradiction]] and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase "the square root of Tuesday" (not a similar example; the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable){{vague|date=June 2014}} operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the ''[[kōan]]'' "What is the sound of one hand clapping?", where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another.

[[James Joyce]]’s final novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' also uses nonsense: full of [[portmanteau]] and strong words, it ''appears'' to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning, but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human’s interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one.

=== Verse ===
''[[Jabberwocky]]'', a [[Poetry|poem]] (of [[nonsense verse]]) found in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word ''jabberwocky'' is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jabberwocky|title=the definition of Jabberwocky|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways.  Its best-known exponent is [[Edward Lear]], author of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' and hundreds of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]].

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'' could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which ''appear'' to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song [[Mairzy Doats]].

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question ''How is a [[common raven|raven]] like a writing desk?''. Someone answered him, ''Because [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] wrote on both''. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. ''both have inky [[quill]]s'').

Lines of nonsense frequently figure in the [[refrain]]s of [[Folk music|folksong]]s, where nonsense [[riddle]]s and [[knock-knock joke]]s are often encountered.

== Philosophy of language and of science ==
{{Further|Sense}}
In the [[philosophy of language]] and the [[philosophy of science]], nonsense refers to a lack of [[sense]] or [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
{{Further|Logical positivism}}

=== Wittgenstein ===
{{Further|Ludwig Wittgenstein}}
In [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writings, the word "nonsense" carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word.  In this sense, "nonsense" does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of [[sense and reference]].  In this context, logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as "nonsense". For example, "1+1=2" is a nonsensical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=md-KV6HUueUC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=wittgenstein+tautology+nonsense|title=Wittgenstein: the way out of the fly-bottle |first=Severin |last=Schroeder |publisher=Polity |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7456-2615-4 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein wrote in [[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]] that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Biletzki, Anat and Anat Matar, "Ludwig Wittgenstein", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Sen ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']"&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, "nonsense" does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book ''Nonsense as the meaning'', highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in [[cryptography]] and other [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] fields.  For example, they need to distinguish [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] from [[signal noise|noise]].  [[Cryptanalysis|Cryptanalysts]] have devised [[algorithm]]s to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and [[Redundancy (linguistics)|redundancy]] in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, ''the'', ''is'' and ''and'' in a text in the [[English language]]. A [[Randomness|random]] scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. [[Zipf's law]] attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their [[cipher]] texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is ''higher'' than found in [[natural language]]s (for example, in the mysterious text of the [[Voynich manuscript]]).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==
{{See also|SCIgen}}
Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense.  The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the ''[[Mad Libs]]'' method: it involves creating templates for various [[Sentence (linguistics)#By structure|sentence structures]] and filling in the blanks with [[noun phrase]]s or [[verb phrase]]s; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add [[recursion]], giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. [[Racter]] was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter’s book, ''The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed'', proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output.

In [[logic]], the semantic '''principle (or law) of bivalence''' states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one [[truth value]], either [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]].&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi|title=Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA124|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A logic satisfying this principle is called a '''two-valued logic'''&lt;ref name="Goble2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bivalent logic'''.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürlimann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hürlimann|title=Dealing with Real-World Complexity: Limits, Enhancements and New Approaches for Policy Makers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BThojvh-XUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2009|publisher=Gabler Verlag|isbn=978-3-8349-1493-4|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] may or may not possess. It is not the same as the [[law of excluded middle]], however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which [[Natural language|natural-language]] statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences which predict events in the future, and sentences which seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; [[Many-valued logic]]s formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the [[Entailment|notion of consequence]] requires the admissibility of premises which, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by [[free logic]]s.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=vii|series=The handbook of the history of logic|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the law of the excluded middle ==

The principle of bivalence is related to  the [[law of excluded middle]] though the latter is a [[syntactic]] expression of the language of a logic of the form "P ∨ &amp;not;P". The difference between the principle and the law is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; For example, the [[three-valued logic|three-valued]] [[Logic of Paradox]] (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the [[law of non-contradiction]], ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its [[intended interpretation|intended semantics]] is not bivalent.&lt;ref name="Priest2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=An introduction to non-classical logic: from if to is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXVbmAw3YwC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85433-7|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the [[law of non-contradiction]] hold.&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA309|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[logic programming]] systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]].  The programmer may wish to add the law of the excluded middle by explicitly asserting it as true; however, it is not assumed ''a priori''.

== Classical logic ==
The intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for classical logic. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.

Assigning Boolean semantics to classical [[predicate calculus]] requires that the model be a [[complete Boolean algebra]] because the [[universal quantifier]] maps to the [[infimum]] operation, and the [[existential quantifier]] maps to the [[supremum]];&lt;ref name="SørensenUrzyczyn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morten Heine Sørensen|author2=Paweł Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52077-7|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is called a [[Boolean-valued model]]. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.

== Suszko's thesis ==
In order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shramko|first1=Y.|last2=Wansing|first2=H.|title=''Truth Values'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2015|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/suszko-thesis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===Future contingents===
{{main|Problem of future contingents}}
A famous example&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; is the ''contingent sea battle'' case found in [[Aristotle]]'s work, ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', chapter 9:

: Imagine P refers to the statement "There will be a sea battle tomorrow."

The principle of bivalence here asserts:

: Either it is true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or it is false that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.

Aristotle {{clarify|reason=replace with more specific words|text=hesitated|date=March 2016}} to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Chrysippus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.  The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the [[philosophy of time]] and the [[philosophy of logic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

One of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that "''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

===Vagueness===
Such puzzles as the [[Sorites paradox]] and the related [[continuum fallacy]] have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.  [[Fuzzy logic]] and some other [[multi-valued logic]]s have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:

: This apple is red.&lt;ref&gt;Note the use of the (extremely) definite article: "This" as opposed to a more-vague "The". If "The" is used, it would have to be accompanied with a pointing-gesture to make it definitive. Ff ''Principia Mathematica'' (2nd edition), p. 91. Russell &amp; Whitehead observe that this " this " indicates "something given in sensation" and as such it shall be considered "elementary".&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is motled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category " red " nor " yellow ", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is "50% red". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:

: This apple is red and it is not-red.

In other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.

However, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P [[And (logic)|and]] not-P implies P [[Inclusive or|or]] not-P, since "or" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.

'''Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases''': Kleene 1952&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Kleene 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', 6th Reprint 1971, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY, {{isbn|0-7294-2130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (§64, pp.&amp;nbsp;332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances "u" = undecided. He lets "t" = "true", "f" = "false", "u" = "undecided" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:

{{quote|We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.

Now if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded "third" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. […] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).

The third "truth value"  u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table".}}

The following are his "strong tables":&lt;ref&gt;"Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q &amp; R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are ''not'' the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: " This apple is red " is " u ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R  " This apple is not-red " is " u ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. " This apple is red AND this apple is not-red " will, per the tables, yield " u ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. " This apple is red OR this apple is not-red " will likewise yield " u ".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of charity''' or '''charitable interpretation''' requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Normand Baillargeon: ''Intellectual Self-Defense''. Seven Stories Press 2007, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, [[logical fallacies]], or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available. According to [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings."

==Application==
Neil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling "Charles") makes just the following five assertions containing the name "Caesar." […]&lt;br/&gt;
(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) &lt;br/&gt;
(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) &lt;br/&gt;
(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) &lt;br/&gt;
(4) Caesar was addicted to the use of the ablative absolute. (Ac)&lt;br/&gt;
(5) Caesar was married to Boadicea. (Bc)&lt;br/&gt;
[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word "Caesar" than does any other individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as ''the principle of rational accommodation''. He summarized it: ''We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement''. The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.

Since the time of Quine ''et al.'', other philosophers{{Who|date=August 2011}} have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:

#The other uses words in the ordinary way;
#The other makes true statements;
#The other makes valid arguments;
#The other says something interesting.

A related principle is the [[principle of humanity]], which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances" ([[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in ''The Intentional Stance'', p.&amp;nbsp;343).

:''This article discusses the history of the principle of least action. For the application, please refer to [[action (physics)]].''
The '''principle of least action''' – or, more accurately, the '''principle of stationary action''' – is a [[variational principle]] that, when applied to the [[action (physics)|action]] of a [[mechanics|mechanical]] system, can be used to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for that system. In relativity, a different action must be minimized or maximized. The principle can be used to derive [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] [[equations of motion]], and even [[general relativity]] (see [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]). The physicist Paul Dirac&lt;ref&gt;P.A.M. Dirac, Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion, Band 3, Heft 1, 64

Schwinger, Selected Papers on Electrodynamics, Dover Publications Inc.(1958), pp. 312.{{ISBN|9780883076484}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and after him Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman, demonstrated how this principle can also be used in quantum calculations.&lt;ref&gt;R.

It was historically called "least" because its solution requires finding the path that has the least value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chapter 19 of Volume II,  [[Richard Feynman|Feynman R]], [[Robert B.

The principle remains central in [[modern physics]] and [[mathematics]], being applied in [[thermodynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2008.04.007 |title=Thermodynamics based on the principle of least abbreviated action: Entropy production in a network of coupled oscillators |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=323 |issue=8 |pages=1844–58 |year=2008 |last1=García-Morales |first1=Vladimir |last2=Pellicer |first2=Julio |last3=Manzanares |first3=José A. |bibcode=2008AnPhy.323.1844G |arxiv=cond-mat/0602186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Principle_of_least_action&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1942PhDT.........5F |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |author1=Feynman |first1=Richard Phillips |year=1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[particle physics]], and [[string theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/LeastAction.pdf Principle of Least Action - damtp]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a focus of modern mathematical investigation in [[Morse theory]]. [[Maupertuis' principle]] and [[Hamilton's principle]] exemplify the principle of stationary action.

The action principle is preceded by earlier ideas in [[optics]]. In [[ancient Greece]], [[Euclid]] wrote in his ''Catoptrica'' that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Scholars often credit [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] for formulating the principle of least action because he wrote about it in 1744&lt;ref name="mau44"&gt;P.L.M. de Maupertuis, ''[[s:fr:Accord de différentes loix de la nature qui avoient jusqu’ici paru incompatibles|Accord de différentes lois de la nature qui avaient jusqu'ici paru incompatibles.]]'' (1744) Mém.

In 1933, [[Paul Dirac]] discerned the [[Path integral formulation#Quantum action principle|quantum mechanical underpinning]] of the principle in the [[Interference (wave propagation)#Quantum interference|quantum interference]] of amplitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=Paul A.

==General statement==
[[File:Least action principle.svg|250px|thumb|As the system evolves, '''q''' traces a path through [[configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (only some are shown). The path taken by the system (red) has a stationary action (''δS'' = 0) under small changes in the configuration of the system (''δ'''''q''').&lt;ref name=penrose&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The starting point is the ''[[action (physics)|action]]'', denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; (calligraphic S), of a physical system. It is defined as the [[integral (mathematics)|integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' between two instants of [[time in physics|time]] ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - technically a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') which define the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}, t_1, t_2] 
= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{\dot{q}}(t), t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

where the dot denotes the [[time derivative]], and ''t'' is time.

Mathematically the principle is&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"&gt;Analytical Mechanics, L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57572-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ'' (lowercase Greek [[Delta (letter)|delta]]) means a ''small'' change. In words this reads:&lt;ref name=penrose/&gt;

:''The path taken by the system between times t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and configurations q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the one for which the '''action''' is '''stationary (no change)''' to '''first order'''.''

In applications the statement and definition of action are taken together:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}},t) dt = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the coordinates in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

==Origins, statements, and controversy==

===Fermat===
{{main article|Fermat's principle}}
In the 1600s, [[Pierre de Fermat]] postulated that "''light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time''," which is known as the '''principle of least time''' or '''[[Fermat's principle]]'''.&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"/&gt;

===Maupertuis===
{{main article|Maupertuis principle}}
Credit for the formulation of the '''principle of least action''' is commonly given to [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], who felt that "Nature is thrifty in all its actions", and applied the principle broadly:

{{quote|The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements.|Pierre Louis Maupertuis&lt;ref&gt;Chris Davis. [http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html ''Idle theory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043538/http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html |date=2006-06-15 }} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This notion of Maupertuis, although somewhat deterministic today, does capture much of the essence of mechanics.

In application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the "[[vis viva]]",

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Maupertuis' principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta \int 2T(t)  dt=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

which is the integral of twice what we now call the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of the system.

===Euler===

[[Leonhard Euler]] gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the ''Additamentum 2'' to his ''Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes''. Beginning with the second paragraph:

{{cquote|Let the mass of the projectile be ''M'', and let its speed be ''v'' while being moved over an infinitesimal distance ''ds''.   The body will have a momentum ''Mv'' that, when multiplied by the distance ''ds'', will give {{nowrap|''Mv'' ''ds''}}, the momentum of the body integrated over the distance ''ds''.  Now I assert that the curve thus described by the body to be the curve (from among all other curves connecting the same endpoints) that minimizes
:&lt;math&gt;\int Mv\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
or, provided that ''M'' is constant along the path,
:&lt;math&gt;M\int v\,ds&lt;/math&gt;.|20px|20px|Leonhard Euler&lt;ref name="eul44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euler, [[s:la:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|Additamentum II]] ([http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E065h external link]), ibid. ([[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Translation:Methodus_inveniendi/Additamentum_II&amp;oldid=6399338| English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Euler states, ∫''Mv''d''s'' is the integral of the momentum over distance travelled, which, in modern notation, equals the abbreviated or [[reduced action]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Euler's principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta\int p\,dq=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

Thus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. Curiously, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.

===Disputed priority===

Maupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician [[Samuel König]], who claimed that it had been invented by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1707. Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works. König himself showed a ''copy'' of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to [[Jacob Hermann (mathematician)|Jacob Hermann]] with the principle, but the ''original'' letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery,&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; and even the [[Frederick the Great|King of Prussia]] entered the debate, defending Maupertuis (the head of his Academy), while [[Voltaire]] defended König.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Euler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752.&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by [[C.I. Gerhardt]] in 1898&lt;ref name="ger98" /&gt; and [[W. Kabitz]] in 1913&lt;ref name="kab13" /&gt; uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]] archives.

==Further development==

Euler continued to write on the topic; in his ''Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature'' (1748), he called the quantity "effort". His expression corresponds to what we would now call [[potential energy]], so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.

===Lagrange and Hamilton===
{{main article|Hamilton's principle}}
Much of the calculus of variations was stated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1760&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=D. J. Struik|title=A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200-1800|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|year=1969}} pp. 406-413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501496-0}} pp. 582-589&lt;/ref&gt; and he proceeded to apply this to problems in dynamics. In ''Méchanique Analytique'' (1788) Lagrange derived the general [[Lagrangian equations of motion|equations of motion]] of a mechanical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lagrange|first=Joseph-Louis|title=Mécanique Analytique|year=1788}} p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1834 and 1835&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Hamilton, "On a General Method in Dynamics", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/GenMeth.pdf Part I (1834) p.247-308]; [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/SecEssay.pdf Part II (1835) p. 95-144]. (''From the collection [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/ Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865): Mathematical Papers] edited by David R. Wilkins, School of Mathematics, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. (2000); also reviewed as [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/ On a General Method in Dynamics]'')&lt;/ref&gt; applied the variational principle to the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in their present form.

===Jacobi and Morse===
In 1842, [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] tackled the problem of whether the variational principle always found minima as opposed to other [[stationary points]] (maxima or stationary [[saddle points]]); most of his work focused on [[geodesics]] on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.J. Jacobi, ''Vorlesungen über Dynamik, gehalten an der Universität Königsberg im Wintersemester 1842-1843''. A. Clebsch (ed.) (1866); Reimer; Berlin. 290 pages, available online [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/cgi-bin/oeitem?id=OE_JACOBI__8_1_0  Œuvres complètes volume '''8'''] at [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/OEUVRES/ Gallica-Math] from the [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica Bibliothèque nationale de France].&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear general statements were given by [[Marston Morse]] in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Marston Morse (1934). "The Calculus of Variations in the Large", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publication'' '''18'''; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is now known as [[Morse theory]]. For example, Morse showed that the number of [[conjugate points]] in a trajectory equalled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.

===Gauss and Hertz===
Other extremal principles of [[classical mechanics]] have been formulated, such as [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]] and its corollary, [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Disputes about possible teleological aspects==

The  mathematical equivalence of the [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] and their [[integral equation|integral]]
counterpart has important philosophical implications.  The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time.  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

states that the ''instantaneous'' force '''F''' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration '''a''' at the same ''instant''.  By  contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) an extended region of space.  Moreover, in the usual formulation of [[classical physics|classical]] action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,

:''Given that the particle begins at position x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ends at position x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an [[extremum]] of the action integral.''

In particular, the fixing of the ''final'' state has been interpreted as giving the action principle a [[teleology|teleological character]] which has been controversial historically. However, according to W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, ''the teleological approach... presupposes that the variational principles themselves have mathematical characteristics which they ''de facto'' do not possess''&lt;ref name="Stöltzner1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stöltzner|first=Michael|title=Inside Versus Outside: Action Principles and Teleology|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-48649-4|pages=33–62 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48647-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some critics maintain this apparent [[teleology]] occurs because of the way in which the question was asked. By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) we are making some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this "backward" inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation. Teleology can also be overcome if we consider the classical description as a limiting case of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] formalism of [[Path integral formulation|path integration]], in which stationary paths are obtained as a result of interference of amplitudes along all possible paths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by the speculative fiction writer [[Ted Chiang]] contains visual depictions of [[Fermat's Principle]] along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. [[Keith Devlin]]'s ''The Math Instinct'' contains a chapter, "Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus" that discusses the calculus "embedded" in some animals as they solve the "least time" problem in actual situations.

The '''product/process distinction''' is the distinction between the product information and the process information of a consumer good. Product information is information that pertains to a consumer good, namely to its price, quality, and safety (its proximate attributes). Process information is information that pertains to the means by which the consumer good is made [[i.e.]] the working conditions under which it comes into being, as well as the treatment of animals involved in its production chain (its peripheral attributes).

The product/process distinction is used by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as a way to determine whether or not a complaint filed by an importing nation is valid and warrants [[trade barriers]] against the exporting nation. Under WTO rules, an importing nation can lodge a complaint with the WTO that the exporting nation uses methods for obtaining or producing the good in question that the importing nation finds to be immoral or unethical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} If the independent World Trade Organization Advisory Board, made up of a panel of international law and trade experts, finds that the importing nation has a legitimate complaint, enforces said ethical standards for domestic production, and isn't trying to merely skirt its free trade obligations, then the Board will rule that trade barriers are justified.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Despite what World Trade Organization officials have said, in practice the World Trade Organization finds these complaints illegitimate the vast majority of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For example, if the [[European Union]] (EU) wants to ban imports of cosmetics that were tested on laboratory animals on grounds that such testing is unethical, it can file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and, in theory, the WTO would allow the EU to enact trade barriers provided that the EU bans its own domestic cosmetic producers from testing on laboratory animals. 
In these cases, however, the World Trade Organization has consistently ruled that such barriers are illegal because only the process is different, while the final product itself is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KIRK|first1=lisbeth|title=MEPs vote for EU ban on cosmetics tested on animal|url=https://euobserver.com/news/1966|website=euobserver|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the WTO has made the product/process distinction an important factor in determining whether trade barriers are justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howse/Regan|title=The Product/Process Distinction--An Illusory Basis for Disciplining Unilateralism in Trade Policy|url=http://iatp.org/files/ProductProcess_Distinction--An_Illusory_Basis_.htm|website=WTO Paper|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Organization has stated that if nations were able to enact barriers merely because the importing nation's standards differ from their own, control could be lost and barriers could be enacted around the world for frivolous reasons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, many complain that these rulings go against the stated intentions of the World Trade Organization, and prove that the organization often puts commercial interests above environmental, ethical, and  human rights issues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The figure shows the four stages of the PCM - awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. On each stage, there is a horizontal decision making process. Inputs (green arrows) influence the internal processing (blue boxes) that creates outputs (yellow arrows). The outcomes are shown in the four different stages of the PCM (grey boxes). The unique decision making process is based upon the level of involvement of the consumer towards a sport/team/event. The following sequence is shown in each stage:

Inputs --&gt; Internal Processing &lt;--&gt; Output

The PCM framework states that, through the processing of internal and external inputs, individuals progress upward along the four psychological connection stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Lock, D., Darcy, S., &amp; Taylor, T.| year=2009| title= ''Starting with a clean slate: An analysis of member identification with a new sports team''| publisher = Sport Management Review, 12, 15-25..}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall evaluation of an object at a specific stage is the product of the processing of personal, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C. Funk |year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7506-8666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==

===Awareness===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Awareness'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John’s introduction to road cycling occurred at the age of 15 through a key socialising agent, his uncle Jack. Jack bought John his first bike, which he rode to school every day. When John was 15 and saw the Tour the France on television, he was amazed by the event. When Jack gave John one of his old road bikes and took him cycling on the weekend, John's progression to the Attraction stage began.
}}
[[Awareness]] stands for the notion when an individual first learns that a certain sport, event or team exists. In this stage the individual has not formed a preference or favourite. The PCM suggests that awareness of sport, teams and events stems from formal and informal channels, for examples parents, friends, school and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Funk, D. C.| year=2002| title= Consumer-based marketing: The use of micro-segmentation strategies for understanding sport consumption| journal = [[International Journal of Sports Marketing &amp; Sponsorship]] |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=231–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases awareness begins during [[childhood]], but can also derive from other socializing agents. The value placed on the specific sport and event from a societal perspective is important in the awareness stage. The examples of ''I know about football'' and ''I know about Liverpool FC'' illustrate the awareness stage box.

===Attraction===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attraction'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John began to realize that cycling provided him a number of positive outcomes. He was able to meet other cyclists, make new friends and spend time with his uncle. He received pleasure from riding outside and the thrill of riding down hills at fast speed. His self-esteem rose by getting into shape and being one of the fastest riders among his friends. He also enjoyed the break from his daily routine when riding the bike. }}

In the attraction stage, the individual has a favourite sport, event, team or leisure hobby.   Attraction is based upon a number of extrinsic and intrinsic motives.  In other words,  the sport, event, or leisure hobby provides the opportunity to satisfy needs and receive benefits. The motives stem from a combination of personal, psychological and environmental factors. The Attraction processing creates outcomes of positive affect and intentions, as well as engaging in consumption behaviour related to the sport and event. The examples of ''I like football'' and ''I like Liverpool FC'' illustrate the attraction stage box.

===Attachment===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attachment'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progresses into the attachment stage relatively quickly and within a year begins riding every Saturday and Sunday morning. Cycling now is an important part in his life. He often wears cycling clothes to class, spent time visiting bike shops and uses the Internet to follow international cycling events. He even joins a cycling club and travels to regional cycling competitions with his friends who are predominantly cyclists.
}}

In the attachment stage the benefits and the sport object are internalised taking on a collective emotional, functional, and symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Filo, K., Funk, D.C., &amp; O’Brien, D.| year=2009| title= ''The Meaning Behind Attachment: Exploring Camaraderie, Cause, and Competency at a Charity Sport Event''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 23, 361-387.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological connection towards a sport, event, team or leisure hobby strengthens. Internal processes become more important and the influence of socializing agents decreases. Examples for the attachment stage are ''I am a football player'' or ''I am a Liverpool Fan''.

===Allegiance===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Allegiance'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progressed into the allegiance stage during his last year of college as the strength of his connection to cycling became durable. He thought of cycling and related activities daily. He always found time to ride and follow the sport regardless of university and work requirements or other sport opportunities. John’s psychological connection to cycling has strengthened and is now guiding his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Funk, D.C., &amp; James, J.| year=2006| title= ''Consumer Loyalty: The Meaning of Attachment in the Development of Sport Team Allegiance''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 20, 189-217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the attachment processing continues, the internal collective meaning becomes more durable in terms of persistence and resistance and has greater impact on activities and behaviour. This is noted by the examples of ''I live for football'' and ''I live for Liverpool FC'' within the allegiance stage.

[[File:Ueber Sinn und Bedeutung Frege 1892.jpg|thumb|right|360px| ''Die Gleichheit fordert das Nachdenken heraus durch Fragen, die sich daran knüpfen und nicht ganz leicht zu beantworten sind''. Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer]]

In the [[philosophy of language]], the distinction between '''sense and reference''' was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]] in 1892 (in his paper "'''On Sense and Reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;"; German: "Über Sinn und Bedeutung"),&lt;ref name=A/&gt; reflecting the two ways he believed a [[singular term]] may have [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].

The [[reference]] (or "referent"; ''Bedeutung'') of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (''bedeuten''), its sense (''Sinn'') is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its [[truth value]], its sense is the thought that it expresses.&lt;ref name=A&gt;"On Sense and Reference" ["Über Sinn und Bedeutung"], ''[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]'', vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25–50, esp. p. 31.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.
#Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name "[[Odysseus]]" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds.
#The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as "[[Hesperus]] is the same planet as [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[analytic philosophy]] is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.&lt;ref name=Speaks&gt;Jeff Speaks, [https://www3.nd.edu/~jspeaks/courses/2011-12/83104/handouts/frege-reference.pdf "Frege's theory of reference"] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]) led to his views on a [[theory of reference]].&lt;ref name=Speaks/&gt;

==Background==
Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' ('concept script') of 1879 and ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Grundlagen]]'' ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Evans, ''The Varieties of Reference'', Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its ''Bedeutung'', literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', '''M''eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the [[Argument of a function|arguments]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Function and Concept", p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.

==Sense==
[[File:Mengs, Hesperus als Personifikation des Abends.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Hesperus]]]]
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, The Countess de Brac as Aurora (1741).jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]]] 
Frege introduced the notion of "sense" (German: ''Sinn'') to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.

First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If ''the evening star'' has the same reference as ''the morning star'', it follows that ''the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun'' has the same truth value as ''the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun''. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its ''sense''.

Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference.&lt;ref&gt;"On Sense and Reference", p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.&lt;ref&gt;See Frege's undated letter to [[Philip Jourdain]], published in ''Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence'', ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cumming, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/names/Names Names], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts based on the work of [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meaning and Necessity]]'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]&lt;ref&gt;“A Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation”, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., ''Structure, Method, and Meaning'', New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; treat sense as an [[intension]], or a function from [[possible world]]s to [[Extension (semantics)|extensions]]. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. [[John McDowell]] supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.&lt;ref&gt;“On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name”, ''Mind'', 86: 159–85, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Devitt&lt;ref&gt;''Designation'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.

==Sense and description==
In his [[theory of descriptions]], [[Bertrand Russell]] held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised [[definite description]]s. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as "The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander," or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the [[descriptivist theory of names]]. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, [[Saul Kripke]] argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; proper names are [[rigid designator]]s which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than [[Richard Nixon]], e.g. [[Hubert Humphrey]], might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot ''mean'' the same as a description.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming and Necessity'' p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by [[Gareth Evans (philosopher)|Gareth Evans]] in ''The Varieties of Reference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gareth|title=The Varieties of Reference|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|editor=John McDowell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John McDowell]] in "The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDowell|first=John|title=On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name|journal=Mind|date=April 1977|volume=86|series=New Series|issue=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Michael Dummett]], who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction ''does'' have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.

==Translation of ''Bedeutung''==
As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German ''Bedeutung'' in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by [[Wiley-Blackwell#Blackwell Publishing history|Blackwell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Beaney (''The Frege Reader'', Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of ''Bedeutung'' by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was based on the principle of [[exegetical neutrality]], namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of [[exegesis]], then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.&lt;ref&gt;Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung'': A Reply to Dr. Bell', ''Analysis'' 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., "On the Translation of Frege's ''Bedeutung''", ''Analysis'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of ''Bedeutung'', and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of ''Bedeutung'' well,&lt;ref&gt;Beaney, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.

==Precursors==
===Antisthenes===
The Greek philosopher [[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], apparently distinguished "a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference." This "suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Susan |title=Antisthenes of Athens: Texts, Translations, and Commentary|publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2015}} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; 
The principal basis of this claim is a quotation in [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]'s “Comments on [[Aristotle]]'s 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: 
# the semantic medium, δι' ὧν λέγουσι
# an object external to the semantic medium, περὶ οὗ λέγουσιν
# the direct indication of a thing, σημαίνειν … τὸ …&lt;ref&gt;Prince 2015, pp. 518–522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between [[connotation]] and [[denotation]], which originates with [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;See section §5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's [[A System of Logic]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mill, a common term like 'white' ''denotes'' all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (''Begriff''). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet [[Earth]], and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept ''planet''. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging ''of'' anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, "A critical elucidation of some points in E. Schroeder's ''Vorlesungen Ueber Die Algebra der Logik'', ''Archiv fur systematische Philosophie'' 1895, pp. 433-456, transl. Geach, in Geach &amp; Black 86-106.{{primary-inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9918">In [[mathematics]], '''signed measure''' is a generalization of the concept of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] by allowing it to have [[negative and positive numbers|negative]] values. Some authors may call it a '''charge,'''&lt;ref&gt;A charge need not be countably additive: it can be only [[Sigma additivity#Additive (or finitely additive) set functions|finitely additive]]. See reference {{Harvnb|Bhaskara Rao|Bhaskara Rao|1983}} for a comprehensive introduction to the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with [[electric charge]], which is a familiar distribution that takes on positive and negative values.

==Definition==
There are two slightly different concepts of a signed measure, depending on whether or not one allows it to take infinite values.  In research papers and advanced books signed measures are usually only allowed to take finite values, while undergraduate textbooks often allow them to take infinite values. To avoid confusion, this article will call these two cases "finite signed measures" and "extended signed measures".

Given a [[measurable space]] (''X'', Σ), that is, a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' with a [[sigma algebra]] Σ on it, an '''extended signed measure''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mu:\Sigma\to \mathbb {R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is [[sigma additivity|sigma additive]], that is, it satisfies the equality
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;
where the series on the right must converge absolutely, for any [[sequence]]  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of [[disjoint set]]s in Σ. One consequence is that any extended signed measure can take +∞ as value, or it can take &amp;minus;∞ as value, but both are not available. The expression ∞&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;∞ is undefined &lt;ref&gt;See the article "''[[Extended real number line#Arithmetic operations|Extended real number line]]''" for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; and must be avoided.

A '''finite signed measure''' (aka. '''real measure''') is defined in the same way, except that it is only allowed to take real values. That is, it cannot take +∞ or &amp;minus;∞.

Finite signed measures form a vector space, while extended signed measures are not even closed under addition, which makes them rather hard to work with. On the other hand,  measures are extended signed measures, but are not in general finite signed measures.

==Examples==
Consider a nonnegative measure ν on the space (''X'', Σ) and a [[measurable function]] ''f'':''X''→ '''R''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! |f(x)| \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Then, a finite signed measure is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu (A) = \int_A \! f(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''A'' in Σ.

This signed measure takes only finite values. To allow it to take +∞ as a value, one needs to replace the assumption about ''f'' being absolutely integrable with the more relaxed condition

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! f^-(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = max(&amp;minus;''f''(''x''), 0) is the [[positive and negative parts|negative part]] of ''f''.

==Properties==

What follows are two results which will imply that an extended signed measure is the difference of two nonnegative measures, and a finite signed measure is the difference of two finite non-negative measures.

The [[Hahn decomposition theorem]] states that given a signed measure μ, there exist two measurable sets ''P'' and ''N'' such that:

#''P''∪''N'' = ''X'' and  ''P''∩''N'' = ∅;
#μ(''E'') ≥ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''P'' &amp;mdash; in other words, ''P'' is a [[positive and negative sets|positive set]];
#μ(''E'') ≤ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''N'' &amp;mdash; that is, ''N'' is a negative set.
Moreover, this decomposition is unique [[up to]] adding to/subtracting μ-[[null set]]s from ''P'' and ''N''.

Consider then two nonnegative measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^+(E) = \mu(P\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^-(E)=-\mu(N\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

for all measurable sets ''E'', that is, ''E'' in Σ.

One can check that both μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are nonnegative measures, with one taking only finite values, and are called the ''positive part'' and ''negative part'' of μ, respectively. One has that μ = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The measure  |μ| = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is called the ''variation'' of μ, and its maximum possible value, ||μ|| = |μ|(''X''), is called the ''[[total variation]]'' of μ.

This consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is called the ''Jordan decomposition''. The measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and  |μ| are independent of the choice of ''P'' and ''N'' in the Hahn decomposition theorem.

==The space of signed measures==

The sum of two finite signed measures is a finite signed measure, as is the product of a finite signed measure by a real number: they are closed under [[linear combination]]. It follows that the set of finite signed measures on a measurable space (''X'', Σ) is a real [[vector space]]; this is in contrast to positive measures, which are only closed under [[conical combination]], and thus form a [[convex cone]] but not a vector space. Furthermore, the [[total variation]] defines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in respect to which the space of finite signed measures becomes a [[Banach space]]. This space has even more structure, in that it can be shown to be a [[Dedekind complete]] [[Riesz space|Banach lattice]] and in so doing the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]] can be shown to be a special case of the [[Freudenthal spectral theorem]].

If ''X'' is a compact separable space, then the space of finite signed Baire measures is the dual of the real Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on ''X'', by the  [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]].

Given the structure of the [[experiment]], it may not be possible to perform it, and even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it.

The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question:
::"A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent)" (Yeates, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;150).

Examples of thought experiments include [[Schrödinger's cat]], illustrating [[quantum indeterminacy]] through the manipulation of a perfectly sealed environment and a tiny bit of [[radioactive]] substance, and [[Maxwell's demon]], which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics|2nd law of thermodynamics]].

== Overview ==
The ancient Greek '''δείκνυμι''' ''([[Transliteration|transl.]]: deiknymi)'', or thought experiment, "was the most ancient pattern of [[mathematical proof]]", and existed before Euclidean mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Szábo, Árpád. (1958) " 'Deiknymi' als Mathematischer Terminus fur 'Beweisen' ", ''Maia'' N.S. '''10''' pp. 1–26 as cited by [[Imre Lakatos]] (1976) in ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' p.9. (John Worrall and Elie Zahar, eds.) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-21078-X}}. The English translation of the title of Szábo's article is "'Deiknymi' as a mathematical expression for 'to prove'", as translated by [http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf András Máté] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231500/http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; where the emphasis was on the conceptual, rather than on the experimental part of a thought-experiment. Perhaps the key experiment in the history of modern science is [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This is widely thought&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Martin, "Wittgenstein's Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments", Blackwell, (Oxford), 2005, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  to have been a straightforward physical demonstration, involving climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy  weights off it, whereas in fact, it was a logical demonstration, using the 'thought experiment' technique. The 'experiment' is described by Galileo in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche]]'' (1638) (literally, 'Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations') thus:

{{quote|''Salviati''. If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter. Do you not agree with me in this opinion?

''Simplicio''. You are unquestionably right.

''Salviati''. But if this is true, and if a large stone moves with a speed of, say, eight while a smaller moves with a speed of four, then when they are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before moved with a speed of eight. Hence the heavier body moves with less speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your supposition. Thus you see how, from your assumption that the heavier body moves more rapidly than the lighter one, I infer that the heavier body moves more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/tns61.htm |title=Galileo on Aristotle and Acceleration  |accessdate=2008-05-24 }} &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the extract does not convey the elegance and power of the 'demonstration' terribly well, it is clear that it is a 'thought' experiment, rather than a practical one. Strange then, as Cohen says, that philosophers and scientists alike refuse to acknowledge either Galileo in particular, or the thought experiment technique in general for its pivotal role in both science and philosophy. (The exception proves the rule&amp;nbsp;— the iconoclastic philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], has also observed this methodological prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paul Feyerabend, 'Against Method', Verso (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Instead, many philosophers prefer to consider 'Thought Experiments' to be merely the use of a hypothetical [[scenario]] to help understand the way things are.

== Variety ==
Thought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]]. In philosophy, they have been used at least since [[classical antiquity]], some pre-dating [[Socrates]]. In law, they were well-known to [[Roman law]]yers quoted in the [[Pandects|Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pandects'' "every logical rule of law is capable of illumination from the law of the Pandects."&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].

==Origins and use of the literal term==
Johann Witt-Hansen established that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] was the first to use the Latin-German mixed term ''Gedankenexperiment'' (lit. thought experiment) circa 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen (1976). Although ''Experiment'' is a German word, it is derived from [[Latin]]. The synonym ''Versuch'' has purely [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] roots.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted was also the first to use its entirely German equivalent, ''Gedankenversuch'', in 1820.

Much later, [[Ernst Mach]] used the term ''Gedankenexperiment'' in a different way, to denote exclusively the ''imaginary'' conduct of a ''real'' experiment that would be subsequently performed as a ''real physical experiment'' by his students.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1883), The Science of Mechanics (6th edition, translated by Thomas J. McCormack), LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court, 1960.  pp. 32-41, 159-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical and mental experimentation could then be contrasted: Mach asked his students to provide him with explanations whenever the results from their subsequent, real, physical experiment differed from those of their prior, imaginary experiment.

The English term ''thought experiment'' was coined (as a [[calque]]) from Mach's ''Gedankenexperiment'', and it first appeared in the 1897 English translation of one of Mach’s papers.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1897), "On Thought Experiments", in ''Knowledge and Error'' (translated by Thomas J. McCormack and Paul Foulkes), Dordrecht Holland: Reidel, 1976, pp. 134-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its emergence, the activity of posing hypothetical questions that employed subjunctive reasoning had existed for a very long time (for both scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of categorizing it or speaking about it. This helps to explain the extremely wide and diverse range of the application of the term "thought experiment" once it had been introduced into English.

==Uses==
Thought experiments, which are well-structured, well-defined hypothetical questions that employ [[subjunctive]] reasoning ([[irrealis moods]]) – "What might happen (or, what might have happened) if . . . " – have been used to pose questions in philosophy at least since Greek antiquity, some pre-dating [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Nicholas Rescher|last=Rescher |first= N.|chapter=Thought Experiment in Pre-Socratic Philosophy|pages=31–41 |editor1-last=Horowitz  |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Massey |editor2-first=G.J.  |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003190/ |title=Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, (Savage)|year=1991 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences many thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th Century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo]].

In thought experiments we gain new information by rearranging or reorganizing already known empirical data in a new way and drawing new (a priori) inferences from them or by looking at these data from a different and unusual perspective. In Galileo’s thought experiment, for example, the rearrangement of empirical experience consists in the original idea of combining bodies of different weight.&lt;ref&gt;Brendal, Elke, "Intuition Pumps and the Proper Use of Thought Experiments". Dialectica. V.58, Issue 1, p 89–108, March   2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought experiments have been used in [[philosophy]] (especially [[ethics]]), [[physics]], and other fields (such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[social psychology]], [[law]], [[organizational studies]], [[marketing]], and [[epidemiology]]).  In law, the synonym "hypothetical" is frequently used for such experiments.

Regardless of their intended goal, all thought experiments display a patterned way of thinking that is designed to allow us to explain, predict and control events in a better and more productive way.

===Theoretical consequences===
In terms of their theoretical consequences, thought experiments generally:
* challenge (or even refute) a prevailing theory, often involving the device known as [[reductio ad absurdum]], (as in Galileo's original argument, a [[proof by contradiction]]),
* confirm a prevailing theory,
* establish a new theory, or
* simultaneously refute a prevailing theory and establish a new theory through a process of mutual exclusion

===Practical applications===
Thought experiments can produce some very important and different outlooks on previously unknown or unaccepted theories. However, they may make those theories themselves irrelevant, and could possibly create new problems that are just as difficult, or possibly more difficult to resolve.

In terms of their practical application, thought experiments are generally created to:
* challenge the prevailing [[status quo]] (which includes activities such as correcting [[misinformation]] (or misapprehension), identify flaws in the argument(s) presented, to  preserve (for the long-term) objectively established fact, and to refute  specific assertions that some particular thing is permissible, forbidden, known, believed, possible, or necessary);
* [[extrapolate]] beyond (or [[interpolate]] within) the boundaries of already established fact;
* [[predict]] and [[forecasting|forecast]] the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable future;
* explain the past;
* the [[retrodiction]], [[postdiction]] and [[hindcast]]ing of the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable past;
* facilitate decision making, choice and strategy selection;
* solve problems, and generate ideas;
* move current (often insoluble) problems into another, more helpful and more productive problem space (e.g.: [[functional fixedness]]);
* attribute causation, preventability, blame and responsibility for specific outcomes;
* assess [[culpability]] and [[compensatory damages]] in social and legal contexts;
* ensure the repeat of past success; or
* examine the extent to which past events might have occurred differently.
* ensure the (future) avoidance of past failures

==In science==
Scientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, "proxy" experiments prior to a real, "physical" experiment ([[Ernst Mach]] always argued that these '''''gedankenexperiments''''' were "a necessary precondition for physical experiment"). In these cases, the result of the "proxy" experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.

Scientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct ([[Carl Gustav Hempel]] labeled these sorts of experiment "''theoretical experiments-in-imagination''"), such as [[Einstein's thought experiments|Einstein's thought experiment]] of chasing a light beam, leading to [[special relativity]].  This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.

==Relation to real experiments==
The relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect ([[EPR paradox]]). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E.T. (1989).[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf  Clearing up the Mysteries], opening talk at the 8th International MAXENT Workshop, St John's College, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that  ''quantum mechanics should be described as "incomplete"''. [[Niels Bohr]] asserted a refutation of Einstein's analysis immediately, and his view prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P., Taylor, E.F. (1979/1989). ''An Introduction to Quantum Physics'', Van Nostrand Reinhold (International), London, {{ISBN|0-442-30770-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J.A, Zurek, W.H., editors (1983). ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;d'Espagnat, B. (2006). ''On Physics and Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0-691-11964-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the [[Bell inequalities]] published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by empirical fact (e.g. by the optical ''real experiments'' of  [[Alain Aspect]]).

Thus ''thought experiments'' belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to [[theoretical physics]], but often to [[theoretical philosophy]]. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has "the final decision on ''true'' or ''not true''", at least in physics.

==Causal reasoning==
The first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation
in time.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, 2004, pp.138-143.&lt;/ref&gt; They are either:
* ''Antefactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what might have happened prior to a specific, designated event, or
* ''Postfactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what may happen subsequent to (or consequent upon) a specific, designated event.

The second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to “the present
moment standpoint” of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:
* Their ''temporal direction'': are they past-oriented or future-oriented?
* Their ''temporal sense'':
:(a) in the case of past-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the past, or from the past to the present? or,
:(b) in the case of future-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the future, or from the future to the present?

== Seven types ==
[[File:The Prefactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Generally speaking, there are seven types of thought experiments in which one reasons from causes to effects, or effects to causes:&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates, 2004, pp.138-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefactual===
''Prefactual (before the fact) thought experiments'' — the term '''[[Defensive_pessimism#Prefactual_thinking|prefactual]]''' was coined by Lawrence J. Sanna in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Sanna, L.J., "Defensive Pessimism and Optimism: The Bitter-Sweet Influence of Mood on Performance and Prefactual and Counterfactual Thinking", ''Cognition and Emotion'', Vol.12, No.5, (September 1998), pp.635-665. (Sanna used the term ''prefactual'' to distinguish these sorts of thought experiment from both ''semifactuals'' and ''counterfactuals''.)&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask "What will be the outcome if event E occurs?"

===Counterfactual===
[[File:The Counterfactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a counterfactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Counterfactual (contrary to established fact) thought experiments'' — the term ''[[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s (1946) notion of a "contrary-to-fact conditional"&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, R.M., "The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional", ''Mind'', Vol.55, No.220, (October 1946), pp.289-307.&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the possible outcomes of a different past;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (''[[Shadows of the Mind|Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness]]'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford),1994, p.240) considers counterfactuals to be "things that might have happened, although they did not in fact happen".&lt;/ref&gt; and ask "What might have happened if A had happened instead of B?" (e.g., "If [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]  '''''had'''''  cooperated with each other, what would mathematics look like today?").&lt;ref&gt;In 1748, when defining causation, [[David Hume]] referred to a counterfactual case: "…we may define a cause to be an ''object, followed by another, and where all objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second''. Or in other words, ''where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed'' …" (Hume, D. (Beauchamp, T.L., ed.), ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1999, (7), p.146.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifactual===
[[File:The Semifactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a semifactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Semifactual thought experiments'' — the term ''semifactual'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman's original concept has been subsequently developed and expanded by (a) Daniel Cohen (Cohen, D., "Semifactuals, Even-Ifs, and Sufficiency", ''International Logic Review'', Vol.16, (1985), pp.102-111), (b) Stephen Barker (Barker, S., "''Even'', ''Still'' and Counterfactuals", ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', Vol.14, No.1, (February 1991), pp.1-38; Barker, S., "Counterfactuals, Probabilistic Counterfactuals and Causation", ''Mind'', Vol.108, No.431, (July 1999), pp.427-469), and (c) Rachel McCloy and Ruth Byrne (McCloy, R. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J., "Semifactual 'Even If' Thinking", ''Thinking and Reasoning'', Vol.8, No.1, (February 2002), pp.41-67).&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the extent to which things might have remained the same, despite there being a different past; and asks the question Even though X happened instead of E, would Y have still occurred? (e.g., Even if the goalie '''''had''''' moved left, rather than right, could he have intercepted a ball that was traveling at such a speed?).

Semifactual speculations are an important part of clinical medicine.

===Prediction===
[[File:Prediction, Forecasting and Nowcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of prediction, forecasting and nowcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[prediction]] attempts to project the circumstances of the present into the future. According to David Sarewitz and Roger Pielke (1999, p123), scientific prediction takes two forms:
:(1) “The elucidation of invariant — and therefore predictive — principles of nature”; and
:(2) “[Using] suites of observational data and sophisticated numerical models in an effort to foretell the behavior or evolution of complex phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;Sarewitz, D. &amp; Pielke, R., "Prediction in Science and Policy", ''Technology in Society'', Vol.21, No.2, (April 1999), pp.121-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they perform different social and scientific functions, the only difference between the qualitatively identical activities of ''predicting'', ''forecasting,'' and ''nowcasting'' is the distance of the speculated future from the present moment occupied by the user.&lt;ref&gt;Nowcasting (obviously based on forecasting) is also known as ''very-short-term forecasting''; thus, also indicating a ''very-short-term'', ''mid-range'', and ''long-range forecasting'' continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the activity of nowcasting, defined as “a detailed description of the current weather along with forecasts obtained by extrapolation up to 2 hours ahead”, is essentially concerned with describing the current state of affairs, it is common practice to extend the term “to cover very-short-range forecasting up to 12 hours ahead” (Browning, 1982, p.ix).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, K.A. (ed.), ''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, and Brown — Murphy, A.H. &amp; Brown, B.G., "Similarity and Analogical Reasoning: A Synthesis", pp.3-15 in Browning, K.A. (ed.),
''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982 — describe a large range of specific applications for meteorological nowcasting over wide range of user demands:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Agriculture: (a) wind and precipitation forecasts for effective seeding and spraying from aircraft; (b) precipitation forecasts to minimize damage to seedlings; (c) minimum temperature, dewpoint, cloud cover, and wind speed forecasts to protect crops from frost; (d) maximum temperature forecasts to reduce adverse effects of high temperatures on crops and livestock; (e) humidity and cloud cover forecasts to prevent fungal disease crop losses ; (f) hail forecasts to minimize damage to livestock and greenhouses; (g) precipitation, temperature, and dewpoint
forecasts to avoid during- and after-harvest losses due to crops rotting in the field; (h) precipitation forecasts to minimize losses in drying raisins; and (i) humidity forecasts to reduce costs and losses resulting from poor conditions for drying tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Construction: (a) precipitation and wind speed forecasts to avoid damage to finished work (e.g. concrete) and minimize costs of protecting exposed surfaces, structures, and work sites; and (b) precipitation, wind speed, and high/low temperature forecasts to schedule work in an efficient manner.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Energy: (a) temperature, humidity, wind, cloud, etc. forecasts to optimize procedures related to generation and distribution of electricity and gas; (b) forecasts of thunderstorms, strong winds, low temperatures, and freezing precipitation minimize damage to lines and equipment and
to schedule repairs.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Transportation: (a) ceiling height and visibility, winds and turbulence, and surface ice and snow forecasts minimize risk, maximize efficiency in pre-flight and in-flight decisions and other adjustments to weather-related fluctuations in traffic; (b) forecasts of wind speed and direction, as well as severe weather and icing conditions along flight paths facilitate optimal airline route planning; (c) forecasts of snowfall, precipitation, and other storm-related events allow truckers, motorists, and public transportation systems to avoid damage to weather-sensitive goods, select optimum routes, prevent accidents, minimize delays, and maximize revenues under conditions of adverse weather.&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Public Safety &amp; General Public: (a) rain, snow, wind, and temperature forecasts assist the general public in planning activities such as commuting, recreation, and shopping; (b) forecasts of temperature/humidity extremes (or significant changes) alert hospitals, clinics, and the public to weather conditions that may seriously aggravate certain health-related illnesses; (c) forecasts related to potentially dangerous or damaging natural events (e.g., tornados, severe thunderstorms, severe winds, storm surges, avalanches, precipitation, floods) minimize loss of life and property damage; and (d) forecasts of snowstorms, surface icing, visibility, and other events (e.g. floods) enable highway maintenance and traffic control organizations to take appropriate actions to reduce risks of traffic accidents and protect roads from damage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindcasting===
[[File:Hindcasting.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of hindcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[Backtesting#Hindcast|hindcasting]] involves running a forecast model after an event has happened in order to test whether the model's [[simulation]] is valid.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;Not only did their hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrodiction===
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[retrodiction]]'' (or ''postdiction'') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (e.g., [[reverse engineering]] and [[forensics]]).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which "past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) the produced them" and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] "involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes",&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Einhorn, H.J. &amp; Hogarth, R.M., "Prediction, Diagnosis, and Causal Thinking in Forecasting", ''Journal of Forecasting'', (January–March 1982), Vol.1, No.1, pp.23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between prediction and retrodiction could be characterized as:
::'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''
regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient.&lt;ref&gt;"…We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term “backward inference”). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, 'Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards' …"(Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1982, p.24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcasting===
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[backcasting]]'' — the term ''backcasting'' was coined by John Robinson in 1982&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson, J.B., "Energy Backcasting: A Proposed Method of Policy Analysis", ''Energy Policy'', Vol.10, No.4 (December 1982), pp.337-345; Robinson, J.B., "Unlearning and Backcasting: Rethinking Some of the Questions We Ask About the Future", ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', Vol.33, No.4, (July 1988), pp.325-338; Robinson, J., "Future Subjunctive: Backcasting as Social Learning", ''Futures'', Vol.35, No.8, (October 2003), pp.839-856.&lt;/ref&gt; — involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (Ducot, C. &amp; Lubben, G.J., "A Typology for Scenarios", ''Futures'', Vol.11, No.1, (February 1980), pp.51-57), and Bunn and Salo (Bunn, D.W. &amp; Salo, A.A., "Forecasting with scenarios", European Journal of Operational Research, Vol.68, No.3, (13 August 1993), pp.291-303).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving 'working backwards' from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;p.814, Dreborg, K.H., "Essence of Backcasting", ''Futures'', Vol.28, No.9, (November 1996), pp.813-828.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503:&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, L., "Towards a Sustainable Future, en route with Technology", pp.496-525 in Dutch Committee for Long-Term Environmental Policy (ed.), ''The Environment: Towards a Sustainable Future (Environment &amp; Policy, Volume 1)'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (Dortrecht), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==In philosophy==
In philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment.  (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.)  The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference.  The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.

For example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others.  Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action's consequences (See [[Consequentialism]]).  [[John Searle]] imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual.  Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist theory of mind]] is correct.

It is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits.  (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to "what we should say," or some such locution.)  A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared.  But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.

Other philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also.  In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.

For example, in the [[veil of ignorance]], [[John Rawls]] asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the [[state of nature]] to imagine the origins of government, as by [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], may also be considered a thought experiment. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] explored the possible ethical and religious implications of [[Abraham]]'s [[binding of Isaac]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' Similarly, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.

An early written thought experiment was [[Plato]]'s [[allegory of the cave]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Rep.'' vii, I–III, 514–518B.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historic thought experiment was [[Avicenna]]'s "[[Avicennism#Thought experiments on self-consciousness|Floating Man]]" thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] in order to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]], and the [[Substance theory|substantiality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility===
In many thought experiments, the scenario would be [[nomological possibility|nomologically possible]], or possible according to the laws of nature.  John Searle's [[Chinese room]] is nomologically possible.

Some thought experiments present scenarios that are not [[Subjunctive possibility|nomologically]] possible.  In his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], [[Hilary Putnam]] asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water.  It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as [[metaphysical possibility]].  It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.

In some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all.  [[David Chalmers]] says that we can imagine that there are [[philosophical zombie|zombies]], or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness.  This is supposed to show that [[physicalism]] is false.  However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable:  we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.

===Interactive thought experiments in digital environments===
{{External links|section|date=May 2018}}
The philosophical work of [[Stefano Gualeni]] focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-52178-1|location=Basingstoke (UK)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book [http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137521774 ''Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools''.]

Gualeni's argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|date=2016|title=Self-reflexive videogames: observations and corollaries on virtual worlds as philosophical artifacts|url=http://www.gamejournal.it/gualeni-self-reflexive-videogames/|journal=G A M E, The Italian Journal of Game Studies|volume=1, 5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like those of thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Among the most visible thought experiments designed by [[Stefano Gualeni]]:

* [[Braitenberg vehicle]]s (robotics, neural control and sensing systems) (some have been built)
* [[Doomsday argument]] ([[anthropic principle]])
* [[The Lady, or the Tiger?]] (human nature)&lt;ref&gt;While the problem presented in this short story's scenario is not unique, it is extremely unusual. Most thought experiments are intentionally (or, even, sometimes unintentionally) skewed towards the inevitable production of a particular solution to the problem posed; and this happens because of the way that the problem and the scenario are framed in the first place. In the case of ''The Lady, or the Tiger?'', the way that the story unfolds is so "end-neutral" that, at the finish, there is no "correct" solution to the problem. Therefore, all that one can do is to offer one's own innermost thoughts on how the account of human nature that has been presented might unfold ? according to one's own experience of human nature ? which is, obviously, the purpose of the entire exercise. The extent to which the story can provoke such an extremely wide range of (otherwise [[equipollent]]) predictions of the participants' subsequent behaviour is one of the reasons the story has been so popular over time.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18028">In the [[security engineering]] subspecialty of [[computer science]], a '''trusted system''' is a system that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the trusted system is trusted to enforce).

The meaning of the word "trust" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A system trusted by a user, is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to do tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorised programs; while trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from that expected, whether or not those programs are innocent, [[malware|malicious]] or execute tasks that are undesired by the user.

==Trusted systems in classified information==

A subset of trusted systems ("Division B" and "Division A") implement [[mandatory access control]] (MAC) labels; as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing [[classified information]]. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel mode, compartmented mode, dedicated mode, and system-high mode. The National Computer Security Center's "Yellow Book" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.

Central to the concept of [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]-style "trusted systems" is the notion of a "[[reference monitor]]", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamper-proof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]'s 1983 [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC), or "Orange Book", a set of "evaluation classes" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.

Key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1) is the dedication of significant system engineering toward minimization of the complexity (not ''size'', as often cited) of the [[trusted computing base]] (TCB), defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy.

An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of "correctness" with that of "trustworthiness".

In contrast to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes&amp;mdash;the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards&amp;mdash;the more recently introduced [[Common Criteria]] (CC)&amp;mdash;which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various [[NATO]] countries&amp;mdash;provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven "evaluation classes" that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the "target of evaluation" (TOE) and support&amp;mdash;even encourage&amp;mdash;an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined "protection profiles." While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a "chain of evidence" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of [[classified information]] derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, working under the close technical guidance and economic sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Ft. Hanscom, MA), devised what is known as the [[Bell-LaPadula model]], in which a more or less trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of '''objects''' (passive repositories or destinations for data, such as files, disks, printers) and '''subjects''' (active entities&amp;mdash;perhaps users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of those users&amp;mdash;that cause information to flow among objects). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded a "history" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows.

At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with "lattice-based information flows" in computer systems. (A mathematical "lattice" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices is either "dominates," "is dominated by," or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of "labels"&amp;mdash;corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, ''e.g.'', TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO&amp;mdash;that are attached to entities.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report&amp;mdash;entitled, ''Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation''&amp;mdash;whereby labels attached to objects represented the sensitivity of data contained within the object (though there can be, and often is, a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself), while labels attached to subjects represented the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. The concepts are unified with two properties, the "simple security property" (a subject can only read from an object that it ''dominates'' [''is greater than'' is a close enough&amp;mdash;albeit mathematically imprecise&amp;mdash;interpretation]) and the "confinement property," or "*-property" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as "no-read-up" and "no-write-down," respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow "downhill" to a repository whence insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the  no-read-up and no-write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are provably sufficient to constrain [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], one of the most general classes of attack (''sciz.'', the popularly reported [[Computer worm|worms]] and [[viruses]] are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).

The Bell-LaPadula model technically only enforces "confidentiality," or "secrecy," controls, ''i.e.'', they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of "integrity"(i.e., the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects)  and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, [[Biba_Model|K. J. Biba]]. Other integrity models include the [[Clark-Wilson model]] and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, "The SeaView Model"&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa &amp; Denning, Dorothy &amp; R. Schell, Roger &amp; Heckman, Mark &amp; R. Shockley, William. (1990). The SeaView Security Model.. IEEE Trans. Software Eng.. 16. 593-607. 10.1109/SECPRI.1988.8114. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220071090_The_SeaView_Security_Model (Source)]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed [[discretionary access control]]s(DACs), '''are''' under the direct control of the system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as [[File_system_permissions#Numeric_notation|permission bits]] (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and&amp;mdash;in a more flexible and powerful form&amp;mdash;by Multics since earlier still) and [[access control list|access control lists (ACLs)]] are familiar examples of DACs.

The behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model&amp;mdash;which may be more or less rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints&amp;mdash;that takes the form of a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) with state criteria, state [[transition constraint]]s, a set of "operations" that correspond to state transitions (usually, but not necessarily, one), and a [[Multiple_single-level#Cross-domain_solutions|descriptive top-level specification]] (DTLS) which entails a user-perceptible [[interface (computing)|interface]] (''e.g.'', an [[API]], a set of [[system call]]s [in [[UNIX]] parlance] or [[Exit_(system_call)|system exit]]s [in [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] parlance]); each element of which engenders one or more model operations.

==Trusted systems in trusted computing==

The [[Trusted Computing Group]] creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.

==Trusted systems in policy analysis==

Trusted systems in the context of [[national security|national]] or [[homeland security]], [[code enforcement|law enforcement]], or [[social control]] policy are systems in which some conditional [[prediction]] about the behavior of people or objects within the system has been determined prior to authorizing access to system resources.&lt;ref&gt;The concept of trusted systems described here is discussed in Taipale, K.A. (2005). [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MIS.2005.89 The Trusted Systems Problem: Security Envelopes, Statistical Threat Analysis, and the Presumption of Innocence], Homeland Security - Trends and Controversies, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Vol. 20 No. 5, pp. 80-83 (Sept./Oct. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, trusted systems include the use of "security envelopes" in national security and counterterrorism applications, "[[trusted computing]]" initiatives in technical systems security, and the use of [[credit score|credit or identity scoring]] systems in financial and anti-fraud applications; in general, they include any system (i) in which probabilistic threat or [[Probabilistic risk assessment|risk analysis]] is used to assess "trust" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems [[Integrity constraints|constraints]] to control behavior within the system), or (ii) in which [[deviation analysis (computing)|deviation analysis]] or systems [[surveillance]] is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.

The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT=DENY) for counterterrorism, anti-fraud, and other purposes is helping accelerate the ongoing transformation of modern societies from a notional Beccarian model of [[criminal justice]] based on accountability for deviant actions after they occur – see [[Cesare Beccaria]], On Crimes and Punishment (1764) – to a Foucauldian model based on authorization, preemption, and general social compliance through ubiquitous preventative [[surveillance]] and control through system constraints – see [[Michel Foucault]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975, [[Alan Sheridan]], tr., 1977, 1995).

In this emergent model, "security" is geared not towards [[policing]] but to [[risk management]] through [[surveillance]], exchange of information, [[auditing]], communication, and [[Categorization|classification]].  These developments have led to general concerns about individual [[privacy]] and [[civil liberty]] and to a broader [[philosophical]] debate about the appropriate forms of [[social control|social governance]] methodologies.

==Trusted systems in information theory==

Trusted systems in the context of [[information theory]] is based on the definition of trust as ''''Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel'''' by Ed Gerck.&lt;ref name="Trust Points"&gt;Feghhi, J. and P. Williams (1998) ''Trust Points'', in Digital Certificates: Applied Internet Security. Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-201-30980-7}}; [http://mcwg.org/mcg-mirror/trustdef.htm Toward Real-World Models of Trust: Reliance on Received Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Information Theory]], information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning. In the context of Information Theory, information is simply that which is transferred from a source to a destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect—as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.

Likewise, trust as defined by Gerck has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts.  Trust is not taken  in the purely subjective sense either,  nor as a feeling or something purely personal or psychological—trust is understood as something potentially communicable. Further, this definition of trust is abstract, allowing different instances and observers in a trusted system  to communicate based on a common idea of trust (otherwise communication would be isolated in domains), where all necessarily different subjective and intersubjective realizations of trust in each subsystem (man and machines) may coexist.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance"&gt;[http://nma.com/papers/it-trust-part1.pdf Trust as Qualified Reliance on Information, Part I], The COOK Report on Internet, Volume X, No. 10, January 2002, {{ISSN|1071-6327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together in the model of Information Theory, '''information is what you do not expect''' and '''trust is what you know'''. Linking both concepts, trust is seen as  '''qualified reliance on received information'''. In terms of trusted systems, an assertion of trust cannot be based on the record itself, but on information from other information channels.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, John D. (1997). [http://pages.ca.inter.net/~euclid1/call.html John D. Electronic Legal Records: Pretty Good Authentication?]&lt;/ref&gt; The deepening of these questions leads to complex conceptions of trust which have been thoroughly studied in the context of business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Huemer, L. (1998). [http://www.borea.nu/index.asp?PAGE=1&amp;ARTICLE=1&amp;saID=78 Trust in business relations: Economic logic or social interaction?] Umeå: Boréa. {{ISBN|91-89140-02-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also leads to conceptions of information where the "quality" of information integrates trust or trustworthiness in the structure of the information itself and of the information system(s) in which it is conceived: higher quality in terms of particular definitions of accuracy and precision means higher trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]]  (1972). [http://www.informatik.umu.se/~kivanov/diss-avh.html Quality-control of information: On the concept of accuracy of information in data banks and in management information systems].The University of Stockholm and The Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

An introduction to the calculus of trust (Example: 'If I connect two trusted systems, are they more or less trusted when taken together?') is given in.&lt;ref name="Trust as Qualified Reliance" /&gt;

The [[IBM]] Federal Software Group &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher"&gt;Daly, Christopher. (2004). A Trust Framework for the DoD Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Environment, IBM Corp., 2004. (Request from the IEEE Computer Society's [http://issaa.org/documents/ ISSAA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726192910/http://issaa.org/documents/ |date=2011-07-26 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that &lt;ref name="Trust Points" /&gt; provides the most useful definition of trust for application in an information technology environment, because it is related to other information theory concepts and provides a basis for measuring trust. In a network centric enterprise services environment, such notion of trust is considered &lt;ref name="Daly, Christopher" /&gt; to be requisite for achieving the desired collaborative, service-oriented architecture vision.

{{Selfref|Regarding the use–mention distinction when writing Wikipedia articles, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Text formatting|Words as words}} and {{section link|Wikipedia:Writing better articles|Use of "refers to"}}.}}

The '''use–mention distinction''' is a [[foundational]] concept of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler (2005) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; according to which it is necessary to make a [[Dichotomy|distinction]] between {{em|using}} a word (or phrase) and {{em|mentioning}} it,&lt;ref name="Devitt99"&gt;Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"&gt;[[W.V. Quine]] (1940) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and many philosophical works have been "vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention".&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt; The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"/&gt;

The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word ''cheese'':&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"/&gt;
* ''Use'': Cheese is derived from milk.
* ''Mention'': 'Cheese' is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''ċēse''.

The first sentence is a statement about the substance called "cheese"; it &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]]; it &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt; the word without &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it to refer to anything other than itself.

== Grammar ==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}

In written language, '''mentioned''' words or phrases often appear between [[quotation mark]]s (as in {{" '}}Chicago' contains three vowels") or in [[italics]] (as in "When I say ''honey'', I mean the sweet stuff that bees make"), and style authorities such as ''[[Strunk and White]]'' insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. '''Used''' words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Shomir|title=A Computational Theory of the Use-Mention Distinction in Natural Language|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11694|publisher=Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If quotation marks are used, it is sometimes the practice to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other:
* When Larry said, "That has three letters," he was referring to the word 'bee'.
* With reference to 'bumbershoot', Peter explained that "The term refers to an umbrella."

A few authorities recommend against such a distinction, and prefer one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Butcher's Copy-Editing: the Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders.'' 4th edition, by Judith Butcher, Caroline Drake and Maureen Leach. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Butcher's recommends against the practice, but ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', section 7.58 (15th edition, 2003), indicates that "philosophers" use single quotes for a practice akin to the use/mention distinction, though it is not explained in this way.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
The general phenomenon of a term's having different [[references]] in different contexts was called ''[[Supposition Theory|suppositio]]'' (substitution)  by medieval logicians.&lt;ref&gt;See Read, Stephen (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-terms Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms]. In [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning—that is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are:
* Properly with a ''[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and real referent'': "That is my ''pig''" (assuming it exists). (personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''concrete but unreal referent'': "Santa Claus's pig is very big." (also personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''generic referent'': "Any ''pig'' breathes air." (simple supposition)
* Improperly by way of ''metaphor'': "Your grandfather is a ''pig''". (improper supposition)
* As a ''pure term'': "''Pig'' has only three letters". (material supposition)

The last sentence contains a mention example.

The use–mention distinction is especially important in [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotation|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quotation/#2.2|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or [[meaningless statement]]s or [[category error]]s. For example, the following correctly distinguish between use and mention:
* "Copper" contains six letters, and is not a metal.
* Copper is a metal, and contains no letters.

The first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word "copper" and not the chemical element. Notably, the word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing.  The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. Notably, the element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters.

[[Stanisław Leśniewski]] was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the [[fallacy]] that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Peter|title=[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2nd edition|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-02-866072-2|edition=e-book|authorlink=Peter Simons (academic)|editor=Borchert, Donald M|page=292|chapter=Leśniewski, Stanisław}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the logical level, a use–mention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{anchor|both use and mention}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] told that in his student years, "quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions". He presented a class of sentences like
{{quote|Quine said that "quotation has a certain anomalous feature."}}
which both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to [[W. V. Quine]], to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of [[proper name|naming]] it or [[definite description|describing]] its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00126690| issn = 0040-5833| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 27–40| last = Davidson| first = Donald| title = Quotation| journal = Theory and Decision| accessdate = 8 December 2010| date = March 1979| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v234l47038554624/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]] statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical [[paradox]]es, such as [[Quine's paradox]]. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] ([[diagonal lemma]]). There are many examples of self-reference and use–mention distinction in the works of [[Douglas Hofstadter]], who makes the distinction thus:

{{quote|When a word is used to ''refer'' to something, it is said to be being ''used''. When a word is ''quoted'', though, so that someone is examining it for its surface aspects (typographical, phonetic, etc.), it is said to be being ''mentioned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Metamagical Themas |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |year=1985 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Logic, Logic, and Logic |last=Boolos |first=George |authorlink=George Boolos |year=1999 |page=398 |quote=In this 1995 paper, Boolos discussed ambiguities in using quotation marks as part of a [[formal language]], and proposed a way of distinguishing levels of mentioning using a finite number of marks, using "′" to modify the succeeding "°", as in:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. Quine]],&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;Whose views on quotation are fine,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;°Boston° names Boston,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;and ′°°Boston°′° names °Boston°, &lt;!-- sic; for more explanation, you must read the paper --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;But 9 doesn't designate 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction "may seem rather pedantic".&lt;ref name="Devitt99" /&gt;

In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher [[John Searle]], [[Jacques Derrida]] mentioned the distinction as "rather laborious and problematical".&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Derrida |year=1977 |p=79 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''−1''' is the [[additive inverse]] of [[1 (number)|1]], that is, the number that when [[addition|added]] to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the [[negative number|negative]] [[integer]] greater than negative two (−2) and less than&amp;nbsp;[[0 (number)|0]].

Negative one bears relation to [[Euler's identity]] since ''e''{{sup|''i''{{pi}}}} = −1.

In [[software development]], '''−1''' is a common initial value for integers and is also used to show that [[Sentinel value|a variable contains no useful information]].

In [[programming languages]], '''−1''' can be used to [[array slicing|index]] the last (or 2nd last) item of an [[array data structure|array]], depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.

'''Negative one''' has some similar but slightly different properties to positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrh89dLWZqEC Mathematical analysis and applications]

== Algebraic properties ==
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=1\cdot x+(-1)\cdot x=(1+(-1))\cdot x=0 \cdot x=0&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot x=(0+0)\cdot x=0\cdot x+0\cdot x \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

so (−1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x'', or&amp;nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.

=== Square of −1 ===
The [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.

For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot 0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\cdot1+(-1)\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\cdot(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.

=== Square roots of −1 ===
Although there are no [[Real number| real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 has infinite solutions]].

== Exponentiation to negative integers ==
[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.

−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.

== Computer representation ==
{{Main|Signed number representations}}
Most computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring "11111111", or "FF" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string "11111111" above represents 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;255.

== Programming languages ==
In some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.
If the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.
If the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.
