{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A priori'' and ''a posteriori''}}
The [[Latin]] phrases '''''a priori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the earlier") and '''''a posteriori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the later") are [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[term of art|terms of art]] popularized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (first published in 1781, second edition in 1787), one of the most influential works in the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Birdarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Graham Bird |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=439 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in their Latin forms they appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|BCE}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

These terms are used with respect to reasoning ([[epistemology]]) to distinguish "necessary conclusions from first premises" (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from "conclusions based on [[sense observation]]" which must follow it. Thus, the two kinds of [[knowledge]], [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]], or [[argument]], may be glossed:

*''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of [[experience]], as with [[mathematics]] (3 + 2 = 5), [[tautology (grammar)|tautologies]] ("All bachelors are unmarried"), and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[pure reason]] (e.g., [[Ontological argument|ontological proofs]]).{{refn|[[Galen Strawson]] has stated that an ''a priori'' argument is one in which "you can see that it is [[Truth|true]] just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref name="Galen Strawson interviewed by Tamler Sommers"&gt;{{harvnb|Sommers|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  
*[[A posteriori knowledge|''A posteriori'' knowledge]] or justification depends on [[experience]] or [[empirical evidence]], as with most aspects of [[science]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal knowledge]].

There are many points of view on these two types of knowledge, and their relationship gives rise to one of the oldest problems in [[modern philosophy]].

The terms ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' are primarily used as [[adjective]]s to modify the [[noun]] "knowledge" (for example, "''a priori'' knowledge"). However, "''a priori''" is sometimes used to modify other nouns, such as "truth". Philosophers also may use "apriority" and "aprioricity" as nouns to refer (approximately) to the quality of being "''a priori''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitcher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}

Although definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of philosophy, they have consistently labeled two separate epistemological notions. See also the related distinctions: [[deductive reasoning|deductive]]/[[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic]], [[Contingency (philosophy)|necessary/contingent]].

==Examples==
The intuitive distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge (or justification) is best seen via examples, as below:

;''A priori''
:Consider the proposition, "If George V reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days."  This is something that one knows ''a priori'', because it expresses a statement that one ''can'' derive by reason alone. 
;''A posteriori''
:Compare this with the [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]] expressed by the sentence, "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936."  This is something that (if true) one must come to know ''a posteriori'', because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.

==Analyticity and necessity==
===Relation to the analytic-synthetic===
{{details|Analytic-synthetic distinction}}

Several philosophers reacting to Kant sought to explain ''a priori'' knowledge without appealing to, as [[Paul Boghossian]] (MD) explains, "a special faculty ... that has never been described in satisfactory terms."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Boghossian|2003|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory, popular among the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] of the early 20th century, is what Boghossian calls the "analytic explanation of the a priori."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996" /&gt; The distinction between [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic and synthetic propositions]] was first introduced by Kant. While Kant's original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment, the contemporary version of the distinction primarily involves, as the American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] put it, the notions of "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact."&lt;ref name=Q21&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning alone, while ''a posteriori analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning ''and'' certain facts about the world. According to the analytic explanation of the ''a priori'', all ''a priori'' knowledge is analytic; so ''a priori'' knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure intuition, since it can be accounted for simply by one's ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question.  In short, proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious metaphysical faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity.

However, the analytic explanation of ''a priori'' knowledge has undergone several criticisms.  Most notably, Quine argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is illegitimate. Quine states: "But for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the soundness of Quine's critique is highly disputed, it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the ''a priori'' in terms of the analytic.

===Relation to the necessary and contingent===
The metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent truths has also been related to ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge. A proposition that is ''[[Modal logic|necessarily true]]'' is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, it is said to be true in every [[possible world]]). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or the meaning of the word "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be true. Thus, the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is ''contingently true'' is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is ''not'' true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known ''a priori'', because "[s]ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §3&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kant, some philosophers have considered the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, "[[logical positivism|Positivism]], in particular, took it for granted that ''a priori'' truths must be necessary...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fodor|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed. [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|Analytic propositions]] were largely taken to be "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact",&lt;ref name=Q21/&gt; while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the [[truth-value]] of synthetic propositions.

Aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other. The American philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), for example, provided strong arguments against this position.  Kripke argued that there are necessary ''a posteriori'' truths, such as the proposition that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (if it is true). According to Kripke, this statement is necessarily true (since water and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are the same thing, they are identical in every possible world, and truths of identity are logically necessary) and ''a posteriori'' (since it is known only through empirical investigation). Following such considerations of Kripke and others (such as [[Hilary Putnam]]), philosophers tend to distinguish more clearly the notion of aprioricity from that of necessity and analyticity.

Kripke's definitions of these terms, however, diverge in subtle ways from those of Kant. Taking these differences into account, Kripke's controversial analysis of naming as contingent and ''a priori'' would, according to Stephen Palmquist, best fit into Kant's epistemological framework by calling it "analytic a posteriori".{{refn|group=nb |In this pair of articles, Stephen Palmquist demonstrates that the context often determines how a particular proposition should be classified. A proposition that is synthetic ''a posteriori'' in one context might be analytic ''a priori'' in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmquist|1987|pp=269, 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Aaron Sloman]] presented a brief defence of Kant's three distinctions (analytic/synthetic, apriori/empirical and necessary/contingent) in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloman|first=A.|date=1965-10-01|title='Necessary', 'a priori' and 'analytic'|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/26.1.12|journal=Analysis|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=12–16|doi=10.1093/analys/26.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It did not assume "possible world semantics" for the third distinction, merely that some part of ''this'' world might have been different.

Thus, the relationship between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity is not easy to discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the ''a priori''/''a posteriori'' distinction is [[epistemology|epistemological]], the analytic/synthetic distinction is [[linguistics|linguistic]], and the necessary/contingent distinction is [[metaphysics|metaphysical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early uses===
The phrases "''a priori''" and "''a posteriori''" are [[Latin]] for "from what comes before" and "from what comes later" (or, less literally, "from first principles, before experience" and "after experience"). They appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

An early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of ''a priori'' knowledge (though not called by that name) is [[Plato]]'s [[Innatism|theory of recollection]], related in the  dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' (380&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), according to which something like ''a priori'' knowledge is knowledge inherent, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] in the human mind.

[[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], a 14th-century logician, wrote on both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. W. Leibniz]] introduced a distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' criteria for the possibility of a notion in his (1684) short treatise "Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' arguments for the existence of God appear in his ''[[Monadology]]'' (1714).&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

[[George Berkeley]] outlined the distinction in his 1710 work ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (para. XXI).

===Immanuel Kant===
The 18th-century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1781) advocated a blend of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] theories. Kant says, "Although all our cognition begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises [is caused by] from experience"&lt;ref name="kant_1781"&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1781|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, ''a priori'' cognition is [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], or based on the ''form'' of all possible experience, while ''a posteriori'' cognition is empirical, based on the ''content'' of experience. Kant states, "[…] it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions [sense data] giving merely the ''occasion'' [opportunity for a cause to produce its effect]."&lt;ref name="kant_1781"/&gt; Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. And unlike the rationalists, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the [[condition of possibility|conditions of possible experience]]. These ''a priori'', or transcendental conditions, are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular (although an argument exists that ''a priori'' intuitions can be "triggered" by experience). 

Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a [[transcendental logic]] with which to consider the deduction of the ''a priori'' in its pure form. [[Space]], [[time]] and [[causality]] are considered pure ''a priori'' intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure ''a priori'' intuitions are established via his [[transcendental aesthetic]] and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these ''a priori'' forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i.&amp;nbsp;e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental deduction]] and it is the central argument of his major work, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the ''a priori'', this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of [[subjectivity]],  what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.

===Johann Fichte===
After Kant's death, a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy, leading to the various forms of [[German Idealism]]. One of these philosophers was [[Johann Fichte]]. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], accused him of rejecting the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge:

{{Quote|... Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Schopenhauer|''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Afro-pessimism''' is a framework and critical idiom that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of enslavement including the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], and their impact on structural conditions as well as personal, subjective, and lived experience, and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality. 

The term was first coined  in 1990 in an article in ''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeune Afrique Economie]]'' by Francophone Cameroonian author [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71173671 |title=African literature : an anthology of criticism and theory |last=Tansi |first=Sony Labou |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub |isbn=1405112018 |location=Malden, MA |pages=54-60 |chapter=An Open Letter to Africans c/o The Punic One Party State |oclc=71173671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Labou Tansi, "Lettre aux Africains... sous couvert du parti punique," ''Jeune Afrique Economie 1''36 (1990): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[intellectual]] [[Frank B. Wilderson III]] developed the term in his political [[memoir]] about his time spent teaching and participating in the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] during [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/9780822374985-003|work=Incognegro|pages=96–146|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822374985|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Tansi, "Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time," which is the "tragedy" that Africa's position "dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of "accumulation and fungibility" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.

Wilderson, along with [[Hortense Spillers]], [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Jared Sexton]], and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the [[Martinique|Martinician]] psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer [[Frantz Fanon]] as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. 

Afro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a [[wikt:transcendence|transcendent]] position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that [[pessimism]] might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of [[African descent]]. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling [[white supremacy]] would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the [[modern world]].

Discussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an [[online]] context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, [[poetics]], and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Afro-Pessimism:The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|date=2016|issue=29|url=http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|issn=1555-9998|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907061732/http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|archive-date=2017-09-07|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Africanism ==
Afro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about [[pan-African]] identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the [[African Diaspora]] and peoples on the [[Africa|African continent]]. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentricity]] as a move away from the colonialism and violence of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]]. The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], a [[Martinique|Martinican]] psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. 

=== Négritude ===
The [[Pan-African]] movement [[négritude]] represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an [[existentialist]] position. A key figure in the movement, [[Aimé Césaire]], uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.

==In international relations theory==
Afro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilderson|first1=Frank|title=Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4692-0|page=346|oclc=457770963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood.&lt;ref name="de B'eberi and Louw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de B’béri |first1=Boulou Ebanda |last2=Louw |first2=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69039">{{short description|Philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the observers}}
{{redirect|Anthropic bias|the book|Anthropic Bias (book)}}
The '''anthropic principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical consideration]] that observations of the [[universe]] must be compatible with the [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[sapience|sapient]] [[life]] that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the [[age of the universe|age]] and the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the [[Fine-tuned Universe|narrow range thought to be compatible with life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html  Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ James Schombert, Department of Physics at University of Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''strong anthropic principle''' ('''SAP''') as explained by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life [[emergence|emerge]] within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a '''weak anthropic principle''' ('''WAP''') similar to the one defined by [[Brandon Carter]], which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the [[multiverse]] for there to be a [[statistical population]] of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of ''only'' this universe, compatible with ''our'' life) could occur.

==Definition and basis==
The principle was formulated as a response to a [[Fine-tuned Universe|series of observations]] that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on [[Earth]].  The anthropic principle states that this is a [[a priori and a posteriori|necessity]], because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe ''some'' universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.

The term ''[[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]]'' in "anthropic principle" has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín J., (2005), ''Antropic Explanations in Cosmology'', in  Hajek, Valdés &amp; Westerstahl (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 12th International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''; http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1658/"&lt;/ref&gt; to be a [[misnomer]].&lt;ref&gt;"anthropic" means "of or pertaining to mankind or humans".&lt;/ref&gt;  While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require [[human]] life or some kind of [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf The Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617015335/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf |date=June 17, 2012 }}, Victor J. Stenger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5FLwnCTMAC&amp;client=firefox-a Anthropic Bias], Nick Bostrom, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking [[falsifiability]] and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropic%20principle anthropic principle]. ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; is "easy" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[truism]].&lt;!--, albeit a "vacuously true" statement [removed for the time being] --&gt;  However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~lwilliam/sota/anth/SAP_FAP.htm The Strong Anthropic Principle and the Final Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstpraxis.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-knowing-sagan-from-pale-blue-dot/ On Knowing, Sagan from Pale Blue Dot]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropic 'coincidences'==
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
In 1961, [[Robert Dicke]] noted that the [[age of the universe]], as seen by living observers, cannot be random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = Dicke, R. H.  | journal = Nature | title = Dirac's Cosmology and Mach's Principle | volume = 192 | pages = 440–441| date = 1961 | doi = 10.1038/192440a0|bibcode = 1961Natur.192..440D | issue=4801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a "golden age", neither too young nor too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Paul Davies | author = Davies, P. | title = The Goldilocks Enigma | publisher = Allen Lane| date = 2006 | isbn = 0-7139-9883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of
[[metallicity]] (levels of elements besides [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]) especially [[carbon]], by [[nucleosynthesis]].  Small rocky planets did not yet exist.  If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the [[main sequence]] and would have turned into [[white dwarf]]s, aside from the dimmest [[red dwarf]]s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|Dirac's varying-G theory]].

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] needed to prevent the [[Big Crunch]] (the "Dicke coincidences" [[argument]]). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of [[baryon]]ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of [[dark matter]] account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a [[Cosmological constant problem|cosmological constant]]. [[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | author = Weinberg, S. | title = Anthropic bound on the cosmological constant | journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 59| pages = 2607–2610| date = 1987 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2607 | pmid = 10035596 | issue = 22 | bibcode=1987PhRvL..59.2607W}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the value [[particle physics]] predicts (this has been described as the "worst prediction in physics").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/02/physicists-debate-nature-of-space-time.html New Scientist Space Blog: Physicists debate the nature of space-time - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s (such as the [[fine-structure constant]]) governing the four [[fundamental interaction]]s are balanced as if [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? ] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html John Baez, mathematical physicist. U. C. Riverside], April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in the [[strong interaction]] would bind the [[dineutron]] and the [[diproton]], and [[nuclear fusion]] would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''Arthur Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Presentation, Volume 1'', Routledge, 2016, p. 211: "the world [is a] mere ''presentation'', object for a subject..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson, ''Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man'', Numen Books, 2015, p. 71: "[Schopenhauer] said that "the world is our conception." A world without a perceiver would in that case be an impossibility. But we can—he said—gain knowledge about Essential Reality for looking into ourselves, by introspection. ... This is one of many examples of the anthropic principle. The world is there for the sake of man."&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "anthropic principle" first appeared in [[Brandon Carter]]'s contribution to a 1973 [[Kraków]] [[symposium]] honouring [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the [[Copernican Principle]], which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the [[Universe]]. As Carter said: "Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=B.| last = Carter | authorlink = Brandon Carter | booktitle =IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data | publisher =Reidel | date = 1974 | location = Dordrecht |title = Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology | pages = 291–298}}; republished in General Relativity and Gravitation (Nov. 2011), Vol. 43, Iss. 11, p. 3225-3233, with an introduction by [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]] (available on [[Arxiv]]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the [[Perfect Cosmological Principle]], which states that all large regions ''and times'' in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the [[steady-state theory]], which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the [[Big Bang]]).

Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a "weak" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged [[spacetime]] locations in the universe, and a more controversial "strong" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.

[[Roger Penrose]] explained the weak form as follows:

{{quote|The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the Earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the Earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the Sun. At any other epoch, the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around to measure the physical constants in question—so the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!|''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'', Chapter 10}}

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make "predictions" about the parameters. But second, "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into ''explanations'' by assuming that there ''is'' more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the [[multiverse]] ("world ensemble" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a [[selection effect]], exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: "why do the [[list of laws of science|fundamental laws of physics]] take the particular form we observe and not another?"

Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term "anthropic principle" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; published that year which distinguished between "weak" and "strong" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: "Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Alfred R.

==Variants==
'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' ([[Brandon Carter|Carter]]): "[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is ''necessarily'' privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers." Note that for Carter, "location" refers to our location in time as well as space.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Carter): "[T]he universe (and hence the [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental parameters]] on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase [[Descartes]], ''cogito ergo mundus talis est''."&lt;br&gt;The Latin tag ("I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]") makes it clear that "must" indicates a [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a [[truism]].

In their 1986 book, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barrow, John D. | title = Anthropic Definitions | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 24| pages = 146–53 | date = 1997 | bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..146B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow &amp; Tipler's definitions are quoted verbatim at ''[http://www.dhushara.com/book/quantcos/anth/anth.htm Genesis of Eden Diversity Encyclopedia.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The observed values of all physical and [[cosmological]] quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where [[carbon-based life]] can [[evolution|evolve]] and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just "observers". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[Spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|spacetime dimensions]], and the [[cosmological constant]]—topics that fall under Carter's SAP.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the "must" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers'."
::This can be seen as simply the classic [[design argument]] restated in the garb of contemporary [[cosmology]]. It implies that the purpose of the universe is to give rise to [[Sapience|intelligent life]], with the [[physical law|laws of nature]] and their fundamental physical constants set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.
* "Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being."
::Barrow and Tipler believe that this is a valid conclusion from [[quantum mechanics]], as [[John Archibald Wheeler]] has suggested, especially via his idea that information is the fundamental reality (see [[It from bit]]) and his '''Participatory anthropic principle (PAP)''' which is an [[Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] associated with the ideas of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]].
* "An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the existence of our Universe."
::By contrast, Carter merely says that an [[multiverse|ensemble of universes]] is necessary for the SAP to count as an explanation.

For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for ''anthropic bias''—that is, the bias created by anthropic [[selection effect]]s (which Bostrom calls "observation" selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

{{quote|Many 'anthropic principles' are simply confused. Some, especially those drawing inspiration from Brandon Carter's seminal papers, are sound, but... they are too weak to do any real scientific work. In particular, I argue that existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories, though these theories quite plainly can be and are being tested empirically by astronomers. What is needed to bridge this methodological gap is a more adequate formulation of how observation [[selection effect]]s are to be taken into account.|''Anthropic Bias'', Introduction&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N. (2002), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''[[Self-sampling assumption|Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA)]]''' ([[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom]]): "Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its [[reference class]]."&lt;br&gt; Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of "observer-moments" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate "reference class": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the anthropic principle essentially just says that the [[conditional probability]] of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as "gravity won't change tomorrow". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the [[prior distribution]] of [[multiverse|alternative universes]] are necessary.&lt;ref name="RgenSchmidhuber"&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], 2000, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic theories of everything.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], 2002, "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html The Speed Prior: A New Simplicity Measure Yielding Near-Optimal Computable Predictions.]" ''Proc. 15th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory'' (COLT 2002), Sydney, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer: 216-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and novelist [[Michael Frayn]] describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book ''The Human Touch'', which explores what he characterises as "the central oddity of the Universe":

{{quote|It's this simple paradox. The Universe is very old and very large. Humankind, by comparison, is only a tiny disturbance in one small corner of it - and a very recent one. Yet the Universe is only very large and very old because we are here to say it is... And yet, of course, we all know perfectly well that it is what it is whether we are here or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frayn]], ''The Human Touch''. Faber &amp; Faber {{ISBN|0-571-23217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Character of anthropic reasoning ==
Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the "fundamental parameters"—that is, the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s and initial conditions for the [[Big Bang]]. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuned]] to permit life. Collins &amp; Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins C. B. | author-link = C. B. Collins | author2 = Hawking, S. W. | author2-link = Stephen Hawking | title = Why is the universe isotropic? | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 180 | pages = 317–334 | date = 1973 | doi = 10.1086/151965 | bibcode=1973ApJ...180..317C}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the "typical" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tegmark, M. | authorlink = Max Tegmark | title = Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?| journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 270 | pages = 1–51| date = 1998 | doi = 10.1006/aphy.1998.5855|arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important development in the 1980s was the combination of [[inflation theory]] with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by [[symmetry breaking]] in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as "fundamental constants" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[string landscape]] emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the number of non-compact dimensions, see [[String theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a [[theory of everything]] having no free parameters. As [[Einstein]] said: "What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world." In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a "theory of everything", [[string theory]], proclaimed "the end of the anthropic principle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kane, Gordon L. | author2 = Perry, Malcolm J. | author3 = Zytkow, Anna N. | last-author-amp = yes | title=The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 7 | date = 2002 | pages = 45–53  | doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00088-4 | arxiv=astro-ph/0001197|bibcode = 2002NewA....7...45K }}&lt;/ref&gt; since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see [[#String theory|below]]).

The modern form of a [[design argument]] is put forth by [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning]] observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, [[Elliott Sober|Sober]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliott, 2005, "[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf The Design Argument]" in Mann, W. E., ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion''. Blackwell Publishers. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903095009/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ikeda and [[William H. Jefferys|Jefferys]],&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W., "The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism," in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150-166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-59102-381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W. (2006). Unpublished FAQ "[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism.]"&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see [[fine-tuned universe]].

[[Paul Davies]]'s book ''[[The Goldilocks Enigma]]'' (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:
#The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.
#The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics which necessitates the Universe being the way it is. Some [[Theory of Everything]] will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.
#The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a universe that allows us to exist.
#Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.
#The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.
#The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: "perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist". This is [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler's]] Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP).
#The fake universe: We live inside a [[virtual reality simulation]].

Omitted here is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Fecund universes theory|cosmological natural selection]], also known as "fecund universes", which proposes that universes have "offspring" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, James N., 2005, "[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-physical-constants-as-biosignature-an-anthropic-retrodiction-of-the-selfish-biocosm-hypothesis The Physical Constants as Biosignature: An anthropic retrodiction of the Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis,]" ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carter, B. | title = The anthropic principle and its implications for biological evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = A310 | pages = 347–363 | date = 1983 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1983.0096 | last2 = McCrea | first2 = W. H. | issue = 1512 |bibcode = 1983RSPTA.310..347C }}&lt;/ref&gt; inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account [[cosmological]] and [[astrophysical]] considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the [[age of the universe]], the evolutionary chain culminating in ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' probably admits only one or two low probability links.

==Observational evidence==
No possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is "required" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in ''our'' portion of ''this'' universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.

Philosopher [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. (1986) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Carter SAP (with [[multiverse]]) predicts the following:
* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early [[phase transition]]s occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;
* Various theories for generating [[multiverse|multiple universes]] will prove robust;
* Evidence that the universe is [[fine tuned universe|fine tuned]] will continue to accumulate;
* No life with a [[alternative biochemistry|non-carbon chemistry]] will be discovered;
* Mathematical studies of [[galaxy formation]] will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

Hogan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hogan, Craig | title = Why is the universe just so? | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume =  72 | date = 2000 | pages = 1149–1161 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1149 | bibcode=2000RvMP...72.1149H|arxiv = astro-ph/9909295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe ''not'' to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:
#a particular multiverse with a "[[measure theory|measure]]", i.e. a well defined "density of universes" (so, for parameter ''X'', one can calculate the [[prior probability]] ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dX'' that ''X'' is in the range ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''X'' &lt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''dX''), and
#an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, ''N''(''X'') (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).
The probability of observing value ''X'' is then proportional to ''N''(''X'') ''P''(''X''). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be "over-tuned", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the [[cosmological constant]] can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would ''not'' count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence  that the Earth or the [[solar system]] occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the [[Copernican principle]] (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see [[Copernican principle]]), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a [[necessary condition]] for our existence as observers.

==Applications of the principle==
{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}

===The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12===
[[Fred Hoyle]] may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on [[carbon-12]] [[atom]]s, that there must be an undiscovered [[resonance]] in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the [[triple-alpha process]]. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;University of Birmingham [http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm Life, Bent Chains and the Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927094126/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 29 (1957) 547&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alfred Fowler|Willie Fowler]]'s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.

However, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (2010) When is a prediction anthropic? Fred Hoyle and the 7.65 MeV carbon resonance. http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5332/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic inflation ===

[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] criticized the entire theory of [[cosmic inflation]] as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D.N. | last = Page | date= 1983 | title = Inflation does not explain time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | page = 39 | doi = 10.1038/304039a0|bibcode = 1983Natur.304...39P | issue=5921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic [[arrow of time]] in a universe with a [[Big Bang]] origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the [[entropy]] of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. [[Paul Davies]] rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = P.C.W. | last = Davies |authorlink = Paul Davies | date = 1984 | title = Inflation to the universe and time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | page =  524 | doi = 10.1038/312524a0|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..524D | issue=5994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any "ad hoc" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

=== String theory ===
{{Main|String theory landscape}}
[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the "backgrounds" or "vacua". The set of these vacua is often called the "[[multiverse]]" or "[[String theory landscape|anthropic landscape]]" or "string landscape". [[Leonard Susskind]] has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

Others—most notably [[David Gross]] but also [[Lubos Motl]], [[Peter Woit]], and [[Lee Smolin]]—argue that this is not predictive. [[Max Tegmark]],&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Livio]], and [[Martin Rees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Livio, M. | author2 = Rees, M.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2000–2002) points out that [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]] and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some [[prior distribution]] on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

===Dimensions of spacetime===
[[File:Spacetime dimensionality.svg|thumb|300px|Properties of ''n''+''m''-dimensional spacetimes]]
There are two kinds of dimensions, [[spatial dimension|spatial]] (bidirectional) and [[temporal dimension|temporal]] (unidirectional).&lt;ref name="Skow2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skow|first1=Bradford|title=What makes time different from space?|journal=Noûs |date=2007 |volume=41 |pages=227–252 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824025031/http://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/research/temporality.pdf |accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let the number of spatial dimensions be ''N'' and the number of temporal dimensions be ''T''. That ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by [[string theory]] and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting ''N'' differ from 3 and ''T'' differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue.  

The implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who in the [[Discourse on Metaphysics]] suggested that the world is [[wikiquote:Gottfried Leibniz|"the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypothesis and the richest in phenomena."]]&lt;ref name="Leibniz1686"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried|title=Die philosophischen schriften von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Volume 4|date=1880|publisher=Weidmann|page=427&amp;ndash;463|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Metaphysics|accessdate=13 April 2018|chapter=Discourse on Metaphysics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square [[law of universal gravitation]]. While Kant's argument is historically important, [[John D. Barrow]] says that it "[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa" (Barrow 2002: 204).&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is because the law of gravitation (or any other [[inverse-square law]]) follows from the concept of [[flux]] and the proportional relationship of flux density and the strength of field. If ''N'' = 3, then 3-dimensional solid objects have surface areas proportional to the square of their size in any selected spatial dimension. In particular, a sphere of [[radius]] ''r'' has area of 4π''r''&amp;nbsp;². More generally, in a space of ''N'' dimensions, the strength of the gravitational attraction between two bodies separated by a distance of ''r'' would be inversely proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Paul Ehrenfest]] showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the [[orbit]] of a [[planet]] about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its [[galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ehrenfest| first = Paul| authorlink = Paul Ehrenfest| title = How do the fundamental laws of physics make manifest that Space has 3 dimensions?|journal = Annalen der Physik| volume = 61| pages = 440| date = 1920| doi = 10.1002/andp.19203660503|issue = 5 |bibcode = 1920AnP...366..440E}}. Also see Ehrenfest, P. (1917) "In what way does it become manifest in the fundamental laws of physics that space has three dimensions?" ''Proceedings of the Amsterdam Academy''20: 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a [[wave]] impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are &lt;math&gt;5 + 2k&lt;/math&gt; spatial dimensions, where ''k'' is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, [[Hermann Weyl]] showed that [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]] works only with three dimensions of space and one of time.&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, H. (1922) ''Space, time, and matter''. Dover reprint: 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] or disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tangherlini| first = F. R.| title = Atoms in Higher Dimensions| journal = Nuovo Cimento| volume = 14 | issue = 27| pages = 636| date= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tegmark| first = Max| authorlink = Max Tegmark| title = On the dimensionality of spacetime| journal = Classical and Quantum Gravity| volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = L69–L75| date= April 1997| url = http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf| doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002| accessdate = 2006-12-16 |arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''T'' differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant [[partial differential equation]]s. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if ''T'' &gt; 1, Tegmark maintains that [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) If ''N'' &lt; 3, gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe is probably too simple to contain observers. For example, when ''N'' &lt; 3, nerves cannot cross without intersecting.

In general, it is not clear how physical law could function if ''T'' differed from 1. If ''T'' &gt; 1, subatomic particles which decay after a fixed period would not behave predictably, because time-like [[geodesic]]s would not be necessarily maximal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1976386 | last1 = Dorling | first1 = J. | year = 1970 | title = The Dimensionality of Time | url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/38/539/1 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 539–40 |bibcode = 1970AmJPh..38..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''N'' = 1 and ''T'' = 3 has the peculiar property that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a ''lower bound'' on the velocity of matter; all matter consists of [[tachyon]]s.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim" /&gt; 

Hence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, which happens to describe the world around us.

== Metaphysical interpretations ==
Some of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare [[Omega Point]]), expressing a ''creatio evolutiva'' instead the elder notion of ''creatio continua''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Johann.&amp;nbsp;Dorschner. und.&amp;nbsp;Ralph.&amp;nbsp;Neuhäuser.&amp;nbsp;Evolution. des.

James Birx, Teilhard de Chardin, V&amp;R unipress GmbH, 2005, p. 109 ff&lt;/ref&gt; From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Karl W. Giberson]]&lt;ref&gt;Giberson, Karl. "Anthropic principle: A postmodern creation myth?". ''Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies''. 9.1/2 (1997): 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt; has been sort of laconic in stating that{{Quote|text=What emerges is the&amp;nbsp;suggestion&amp;nbsp;that cosmology may at last be in possession of some raw material for a&amp;nbsp;[[postmodern]] creation myth.|sign=[[Karl W. Giberson]]|source=}}

===''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle''===
A thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]], a [[cosmologist]], and [[Frank J. Tipler]], a [[cosmologist]] and [[mathematical physicist]]. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical [[astrophysics]], it also touches on [[quantum physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. An entire chapter argues that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is, with high probability, the only [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent species]] in the [[Milky Way]].

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the [[history of ideas]] the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of [[teleology]] and [[intelligent design]]. They discuss the writings of [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Bergson]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and the [[Omega Point]] cosmology of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish [[teleology|teleological]] reasoning from [[eutaxiology|''eutaxiological'']] reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hicks| first= L. E.| date=1883| title=A Critique of Design Arguments| location=New York| publisher=Scribner's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the [[final anthropic principle]] (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and "closely connected with moral values". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the [[universe]], constraints developed further in Tipler's ''The Physics of Immortality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = F. J. | last = Tipler |authorlink = Frank Tipler | title = The Physics of Immortality | publisher = DoubleDay | date = 1994 |isbn =  0-385-46798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such constraint is that the universe must end in a [[big crunch]], which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about [[dark energy]], based on observations of very distant [[supernova]]s.

In his review&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, M.]], "WAP, SAP, PAP, and FAP," ''The New York Review of Books 23'', No. 8 (May 8, 1986): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; of Barrow and Tipler, [[Martin Gardner]] ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):

{{quote|At the instant the [[Omega Point]] is reached, life will have gained control of ''all'' matter and forces not only in a single universe, but in all universes whose existence is logically possible; life will have spread into ''all'' spatial regions in all universes which could logically exist, and will have stored an infinite amount of information, including ''all'' bits of knowledge which it is logically possible to know. And this is the end.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 677&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception and controversies  ==
Carter  has frequently regretted his own choice of the word "anthropic", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. message from [[Martin Rees]] presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links)&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised the word "principle" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of [[selection effects]].

A common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy [[deus ex machina]] which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: "[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Penrose, R. |authorlink = Roger Penrose | title = The Emperor's New Mind | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-851973-7 | date =1989}} Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as [[truism]]s or trivial [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]—that is, statements true solely by virtue of their [[logical form]] (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying "if things were different, they would be different", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a [[scientific method|scientific statement]] but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a [[multiverse]], although some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Starkman, G. D. | author2 = Trotta, R. | title = Why Anthropic Reasoning Cannot Predict Λ | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 |page = 201301 | date = 2006 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.201301 | pmid = 17155671 | issue = 20 | bibcode=2006PhRvL..97t1301S|arxiv = astro-ph/0607227 }} See also this [http://www.physorg.com/news83924839.html news story.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's ''anthropic cosmological principle'', which are [[Teleology|teleological]] notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a ''necessary prerequisite'' for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| date =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | date= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time| isbn=0-7167-3090-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shermer| first=Michael | date= 2007 | title=Why Darwin Matters| isbn=0-8050-8121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] through [[natural selection]] to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]], for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called "[[carbon chauvinism]]", see also [[alternative biochemistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal | author = [[Bernard Carr|Carr, B. J.]] |author2=[[Martin Rees|Rees, M. J.]] | title = The anthropic principle and the structure of the physical world | journal = Nature | volume = 278 | pages = 605–612| date = 1979 | doi = 10.1038/278605a0 | bibcode=1979Natur.278..605C | issue=5705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a [[fine tuned universe]] have argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stenger| first=Victor J| authorlink = Victor Stenger | date= 2000| title=Timeless Reality: Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes| publisher=Prometheus Books| isbn = 1-57392-859-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Harnik et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harnik, R. | author2 = Kribs, G. | author3 = Perez, G. | date = 2006 | title =A Universe without Weak interactions | journal = Physical Review | volume = D74 | page = 035006 | doi =10.1103/PhysRevD.74.035006 |arxiv= hep-ph/0604027 | bibcode=2006PhRvD..74c5006H | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a [[weakless universe]] in which the [[weak nuclear force]] is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other [[fundamental interaction]]s, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—[[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[galaxies]], etc.

[[Lee Smolin]] has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his [[Lee Smolin#Cosmological natural selection|fecund universes]] theory, which assumes universes have "offspring" through the creation of [[black hole]]s whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lee Smolin| author-link=Lee Smolin | editor=Tyson, Neil deGrasse | editor-link=Neil deGrasse Tyson | editor2=Soter, Steve | editor2-link=Steven Soter| date=2001| title=Cosmic Horizons: Astronomy at the Cutting Edge | publisher= The New Press| isbn = 978-1-56584-602-9 | pages =148–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophers of cosmology [[John Earman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Earman John | date = 1987 | title = The SAP also rises: A critical examination of the anthropic principle | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 24 | pages = 307–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernan McMullin]],&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan. (1994). "Fine-tuning the Universe?" In M. Shale &amp; G. Shields (ed.), ''Science, Technology, and Religious Ideas'', Lanham: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jesús Mosterín]] contend that "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation".&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús. (2005). Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed "anthropic" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

{{quote|The suggestion that an infinity of objects characterized by certain numbers or properties implies the existence among them of objects with any combination of those numbers or characteristics [...] is mistaken. An infinity does not imply at all that any arrangement is present or repeated. [...] The assumption that all possible worlds are realized in an infinite universe is equivalent to the assertion that any infinite set of numbers contains all numbers (or at least all Gödel numbers of the [defining] sequences), which is obviously false.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11532">British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] formulated three [[adage]]s that are known as '''Clarke's three laws''', of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited. They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception|last=Beech|first=Martin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9781461406150|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws include:

#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}} When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}} The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}} Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's "laws" were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2006|isbn=9780312340049|location=New York|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'" in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as "Clarke's Law" in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths|last=Shermer|first=Michael|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|year=2011|isbn=9780805091250|location=New York|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: "As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there".

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the "Hazards of Prophecy" essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Popular Library|year=1973|isbn=9780330236195|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: "Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned".&lt;ref&gt;"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon", ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: "...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic," and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood."

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he "would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic", referring to his memory of "seeing and hearing [[Lynotype|Linotype]] machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’".&lt;ref name="Gooden2015"/&gt;

== Proposed fourth law ==
A fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws. [[Geoff Holder]] quotes: "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,"&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2009). ''101 Things to Do with a Stone Circle''. The History Press, 2009. Holder offers as his source Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' (Millennium Edition, 1999, paperback edition page 143, {{ISBN|0-575-40277-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of American economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert, but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact", from his 1995 book ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[ Massimo Pigliucci]], ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk'', 2010, {{ISBN|0226667871}}; an epigraph to Chapter 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;pg=PA279 p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants of the third law ==

The third law has inspired many [[snowclone]]s and other variations:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Comstock–Needham system''' is a naming system for [[insect]] [[Insect wing|wing]] [[veins]], devised by [[John Henry Comstock|John Comstock]] and [[James George Needham|George Needham]] in 1898. It was an important step in showing the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of all [[insect wings]]. This system was based on Needham's ''pretracheation theory'' that was later discredited by [[Frederic Charles Fraser]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, F. C.  1938.  A note on the fallaciousness of the theory of pretracheation in the venation of Odonata.  ''Proc. Roy. Ent. Soc. London'' (A) 13: 60–70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vein terminology==

===Longitudinal veins===
[[Image:Comstock-needham.svg|thumb|Insect wing venation, showing the names after the Comstock–Needham system|400px|right]]The Comstock and Needham system attributes different names to the veins on an insect's wing. From the [[anterior]] (leading) edge of the wing towards the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (rear), the major [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] veins are named:
*{{anchor|costa}}''costa'' '''C''', meaning ''rib''
*{{anchor|subcosta}}''subcosta'' '''Sc''', meaning ''below the rib''
*{{anchor|radius}}''radius'' '''R''', in analogy with a bone in the forearm, the [[radius (bone)|radius]]
*{{anchor|media}}''media'' '''M''', meaning ''middle''
*{{anchor|cubitus}}''cubitus'' '''Cu''', meaning ''elbow''
*{{anchor|anal veins}}''anal veins'' '''A''', in reference to its posterior location

Apart from the costal and the anal veins, each vein can be branched, in which case the branches are numbered from anterior to posterior. For example, the two branches of the {{anchor|subcostal vein}}subcostal vein will be called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

The {{anchor|radial veins}}radius typically branches once near the base, producing anteriorly the '''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and posteriorly the ''radial sector'' '''Rs'''. The radial sector may fork twice.

The media may also fork twice, therefore having four branches reaching the wing margin.

According to the Comstock–Needham system, the cubitus forks once, producing the {{anchor|cubital vein}}cubital veins Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 
According to some other authorities, Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may fork again, producing the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1a&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;1b&lt;/sub&gt;.

As there are several anal veins, they are called '''A1''', '''A2''', and so on. They are usually unforked.

===Crossveins===
Crossveins link the longitudinal veins, and are named accordingly (for example, the medio-cubital crossvein is termed '''m-cu'''). Some crossveins have their own name, like the [[humeral]] crossvein '''h''' and the sectoral crossvein '''s'''.

==Cell terminology==
The cells are named after the vein on the anterior side; for instance, the cell between Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is called '''Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

In the case where two cells are separated by a crossvein but have the same anterior longitudinal vein, they should have the same name. To avoid this, they are attributed a number. For example, the R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cell is divided in two by the radial cross vein: the basal cell is termed "first R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;", and the distal cell "second R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;".

If a cell is bordered anteriorly by a forking vein, such as R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the cell is named after the distal vein, in this case R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Abélard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Suárez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincaré's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant’s Conceptualism, and Kant’s Non-Conceptualism" – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41–64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept is usually perceived as a regularity in events or objects or in their records. While constructing a [[concept map]], it is essential to keep in mind that the concept be built with reference to a focus question. Hence, initially, the focus question to which we seek to answer is carefully chosen because learners usually tend to deviate from this question relating only to domains and thus, fails to answer the question.

With the selected domain and the focus question, the next step is to identify the key concepts which apply to this domain.About 15 to 25 concepts is sufficient which is usually ordered in a rank ordered list. Such list should be established from the most general and inclusive concept for the particular chosen problem. This list will assist in at least in the beginning of the construction of the concept map. The list is referred to as Parking Lot since the list is constantly shuffled to build up the required network of the concept. Two or more concepts are connected to each other using linking words or phrases which can only then complete a meaningful sentence.Another important characteristics of a concept map is the [[cross-link]]s.  This cross link acts as the relationship between two different domains  used in the concept map.This helps in a clear representation of the knowledge contained in the concept and also gives a clear background with specific examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/howto/assesslearning/conceptmaps.html |title=Concept Maps - Enhancing Education - Carnegie Mellon University |publisher=Cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cosmology}}
In modern [[physical cosmology]], the '''cosmological principle''' is the notion that the spatial distribution of matter in the universe is [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[Isotropy|isotropic]] when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large-scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the [[Big Bang]].

==Definition==
Astronomer William Keel explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.&lt;ref name=Keel&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Galaxy Formation (2nd ed.) |author=William C. Keel |isbn=978-3-540-72534-3 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cosmological principle depends on a definition of "observer," and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences.

"Observers" means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, "the cosmological principle [means that] the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are."&lt;ref name=Liddle&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.) |author=Andrew Liddle |isbn=978-0-470-84835-7 |year=2003 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the Sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a "foamy" texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics.

The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]]. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout" {{dubious|Homogeneity vs isotropy|date=September 2016}}). The principles are distinct but closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.

== Origin ==
The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) of Isaac Newton.{{dubious|it is debatable that Newton stated the cosmological principle in the form we intend at this day and age.|date=May 2018}} In contrast to earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of universe, Newton conceptualized the Earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the Sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of "[[universal gravitation]]" that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the Moon around the Earth, the Earth around the Sun, and to falling bodies on Earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself.

== Implications ==
Observations show that more distant galaxies are closer together and have lower content of chemical elements heavier than lithium.&lt;ref name="CMB_Timeline300"&gt;[[:Image:CMB Timeline75.jpg]] - NASA (public domain image)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the cosmological principle, this suggests that heavier elements were not created in the Big Bang but were produced by [[nucleosynthesis]] in giant stars and expelled across a series of supernovae explosions and new star formation from the supernovae remnants, which means heavier elements would accumulate over time. Another observation is that the furthest galaxies (earlier time) are often more fragmentary, interacting and unusually shaped than local galaxies (recent time), suggesting evolution in galaxy structure as well.

A related implication of the cosmological principle is that the largest discrete structures in the universe are in [[mechanical equilibrium]]. Homogeneity and isotropy of matter at the largest scales would suggest that the largest discrete structures are parts of a single indiscrete form, like the crumbs which make up the interior of a cake. At extreme cosmological distances, the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested; however, under the assumption of the cosmological principle, it cannot be detected parallel to the line of sight (see [[timeline of the formation of the Universe|timeline of the universe]]).

Cosmologists agree that in accordance with observations of distant galaxies, a universe must be non-static if it follows the cosmological principle. In 1923, [[Alexander Friedmann]] set out a variant of [[Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] that describe the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic universe.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Welt als Raum und Zeit (The World as Space and Time) |publisher=Ostwalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften |author=[[Alexander Friedmann]] |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/248202523&amp;referer=brief_results  |isbn=3-8171-3287-5  |year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abramovitch&gt;{{cite book |page=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DPC4a0CSq4C&amp;pg=PA219 |isbn=0-521-38470-2 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |title=Alexander A. Friedmann: The Man who Made the Universe Expand |author1=Ėduard Abramovich Tropp |author2=Viktor Ya. Frenkel |author3=Artur Davidovich Chernin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, [[Georges Lemaître]] derived in 1927 the equations of an expanding universe from the General Relativity equations.&lt;ref name=Lemaitre1927&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Un univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques | year=1927 | journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | issue=5 | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L | pages=49–56 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }} ''translated by [[A. S. Eddington]]'': {{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Expansion of the universe, A homogeneous universe of constant mass and increasing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extra-galactic nebulæ | year=1931 | journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=91 | bibcode=1931MNRAS..91..483L | pages=483–490 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | doi=10.1093/mnras/91.5.483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a non-static universe is also implied, independent of observations of distant galaxies, as the result of applying the cosmological principle to [[general relativity]].

== Criticism ==
[[Karl Popper]] criticized the cosmological principle on the grounds that it makes "our ''lack'' of knowledge a principle of ''knowing something''". He summarized his position as:
:the “cosmological principles” were, I fear, dogmas that should not have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh: [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9062/1/Popper_%26_cosmology_PhilSci.pdf “The most philosophically of all the sciences”: Karl Popper and physical cosmology] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations ==
Although the universe is inhomogeneous at smaller scales, it ''is'' statistically homogeneous on scales larger than 250 million light years. The [[cosmic microwave background]] is isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/universe-homogeneous-300-million-light-years/24149/]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent findings have called this view into question. Data from the [[Planck Mission]] shows hemispheric bias in 2 respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). Therefore, the [[European Space Agency]] (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored.&lt;ref name="Planck"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sci.esa.int/planck/51551-simple-but-challenging-the-universe-according-to-planck/ | title=Simple but challenging: the Universe according to Planck | work=[[ESA Science &amp; Technology]] | origyear=March 21, 2013 |date= October 5, 2016 | accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconsistencies===
The ''cosmological principle'' implies that at a sufficiently large scale, the universe is [[homogeneous]]. This means that different places will appear similar to one another, so sufficiently large structures cannot exist{{clarify|what is actually meant by existence of a structure here?|date=April 2017}}. Yadav and his colleagues have suggested a maximum scale of 260[[Parsec#Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs|/h Mpc]] for structures within the universe according to this{{which|date=April 2017}} [[heuristic]]. Other authors have suggested values as low as 60/h Mpc.&lt;ref name=Yadav&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Jaswant |author2=J. S. Bagla |author3=Nishikanta Khandai|title=Fractal dimension as a measure of the scale of homogeneity|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=25 February 2010|volume=405|issue=3|pages=2009–2015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16612.x |arxiv = 1001.0617 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2009Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadav's calculation suggests that the maximum size of a structure can be about 370&amp;nbsp;Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clowers |first=Roger G. |year=2013 |title=A structure in the early universe at z ~ 1.3 that exceeds the homogeneity scale of the R-W concordance cosmology |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=429 |issue=4 |pages=2910–2916|arxiv=1211.6256 |bibcode=2013MNRAS.429.2910C |doi= 10.1093/mnras/sts497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of observations conflict with predictions of maximal structure sizes:

*The [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], discovered in 1991, has a length of 580 Mpc, and is marginally larger than the consistent scale.
*The [[Sloan Great Wall]], discovered in 2003, has a length of 423 Mpc,&lt;ref name=apj624_2_463&gt;{{Cite journal | display-authors=1 | last1=Gott | first1=J. Richard, III | last2=Jurić | first2=Mario | last3=Schlegel| first3=David | last4=Hoyle | first4=Fiona | last5=Vogeley | first5=Michael | last6=Tegmark | first6=Max | last7=Bahcall | first7=Neta |last8=Brinkmann | first8=Jon | title=A Map of the Universe | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=624 | issue=2 | pages=463–484 |date=May 2005 | doi=10.1086/428890 | bibcode=2005ApJ...624..463G |arxiv = astro-ph/0310571}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is only just consistent with the cosmological principle.
*[[U1.11]], a [[large quasar group]] discovered in 2011, has a length of 780 Mpc, and is two times larger than the upper limit of the homogeneity scale.
*The [[Huge-LQG]], discovered in 2012, is three times longer than, and twice as wide as is predicted possible according to these current models, and so challenges our understanding of the universe on large scales.
*In November 2013, a new structure 10 billion light years away measuring 2000-3000 Mpc (more than seven times that of the SGW) has been discovered, the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]], putting further doubt on the validity of the cosmological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1311.1104|last1= Horvath|first1= I.|title= The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts|last2=  Hakkila|first2= J.|last3=  Bagoly|first3= Z.|class= astro-ph.CO|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, however, studies of the expansion of the Universe that have used data taken by the ''[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]'' mission show it to be highly [[isotropy|isotropical]], reinforcing the cosmological principle&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07178 How isotropic is the Universe?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect cosmological principle==
The '''perfect cosmological principle''' is an extension of the cosmological principle, and states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space ''and'' time. In this view the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. The perfect cosmological principle underpins [[Steady State theory]] and emerges{{clarify|underpins emerging? does this mean underpins the emergence of something (unstated) from chaotic inflation theory?|date=April 2017}} from [[chaotic inflation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aguirre, Anthony|author2=Gratton, Steven|last-author-amp=yes|title=Inflation without a beginning: A null boundary proposal|journal= Phys.

'''D'Alembert's principle''', also known as the '''Lagrange–d'Alembert principle''', is a statement of the fundamental [[classical physics|classical]] laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the [[France|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].  It is the dynamic analogue to the ''principle of [[virtual work]] for applied forces'' in a static system and in fact is  more general than [[Hamilton's principle]], avoiding restriction to [[holonomic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |edition=4th |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holonomic constraint depends only on the coordinates and time.

The principle states that the sum of the differences between the [[force]]s acting on a system of mass particles and the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system itself projected onto any [[virtual displacement]] consistent with the constraints of the system is zero. Thus, in symbols d'Alembert's principle is written as following,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where :

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; || is an integer used to indicate (via subscript) a variable corresponding to a particular particle in the system,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the total applied force (excluding constraint forces) on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt; m_i \scriptstyle&lt;/math&gt; || is the mass of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the acceleration of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || together as product represents the time derivative of the momentum of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle if the masses do not change with time, and
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the virtual displacement of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle, consistent with the constraints.
|}

This above equation is often called d'Alembert's principle, but it was first written in this variational form by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1956), ''Mechanics:  Lectures on Theoretical Physics'', Vol 1, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Alembert's contribution was to demonstrate that in the totality of a dynamic system the forces of constraint vanish.  That is to say that the [[generalized forces]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf Q}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; need not include constraint forces.  It is equivalent to the somewhat more cumbersome [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]].

==General case with changing masses==
The general statement of d'Alembert's principle mentions "the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system". The momentum of the ''i''-th mass is the product of its mass and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i = m_i \mathbf v_i&lt;/math&gt;

and its time derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In many applications, the masses are constant and this equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

which appears in the formula given above. However, some applications involve changing masses (for example, chains being rolled up or being unrolled) and in those cases both terms &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt; have to remain present, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i - \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i)\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation for special cases==
To date, nobody has shown that D'Alembert's principle is equivalent to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]]. D'Alembert's principle is a more general case .  And it is true only for some very special cases e.g. rigid body constraints.  However, an approximate solution to this problem does exist.&lt;ref name="Rebhan2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rebhan |first=Eckhard |title=Mechanik |series=Theoretische Physik |year=2006 |publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany  |isbn=978-3-8274-1716-9 |chapter=Exkurs 5.1: Ableitung des d'Alembert Prinzips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider Newton's law for a system of particles, i. The total force on each particle is&lt;ref name="Torby1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America  |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} = m_i \mathbf {a}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)}&lt;/math&gt; || are the total forces acting on the system's particles,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf {a}_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || are the inertial forces that result from the total forces.
|}

Moving the inertial forces to the left gives an expression that can be considered to represent quasi-static equilibrium, but which is really just a small algebraic manipulation of Newton's law:&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} - m_i \mathbf {a}_i = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the [[virtual work]], &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt;, done by the total and inertial forces together through an arbitrary virtual displacement, &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the system leads to a zero identity, since the forces involved sum to zero for each particle.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The original vector equation could be recovered by recognizing that the work expression must hold for arbitrary displacements. Separating the total forces into applied forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_i&lt;/math&gt;, and constraint forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i + \sum_{i} \mathbf {C}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If arbitrary virtual displacements are assumed to be in directions that are orthogonal to the constraint forces (which is not usually the case, so this derivation works only for special cases), the constraint forces do no work. Such displacements are said to be ''consistent'' with the constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title = Teaching Students Work and Virtual Work Method in Statics:A Guiding Strategy with Illustrative Examples|first = Ing-Chang|last = Jong|conference = 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition|year = 2005|url = http://search.asee.org/search/fetch?url=file%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FE%3A%2Fsearch%2Fconference%2F29%2FAC%25202005Paper1212.pdf&amp;index=conference_papers&amp;space=129746797203605791716676178&amp;type=application%2Fpdf&amp;charset=|accessdate = June 24, 2014|section = Improving Mechanics of Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the formulation of ''d'Alembert's principle'', which states that the difference of applied forces and inertial forces for a dynamic system does no virtual work:.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a corresponding principle for static systems called the [[virtual work#Principle of virtual work for applied forces|principle of virtual work for applied forces]].

==D'Alembert's principle of inertial forces==
D'Alembert showed that one can transform an accelerating rigid body into an equivalent static system by adding the so-called "[[inertial force]]"  and "[[inertial torque]]" or moment. The inertial force must act through the center of mass and the inertial torque can act anywhere. The system can then be analyzed exactly as a static system subjected to this "inertial force and moment" and the external forces. The advantage is that, in the equivalent static system one can take moments about any point (not just the center of mass). This often leads to simpler calculations because any force (in turn) can be eliminated from the moment equations by choosing the appropriate point about which to apply the moment equation (sum of moments = zero). Even in the course of Fundamentals of Dynamics and Kinematics of machines, this principle helps in analyzing the forces that act on a link of a mechanism when it is in motion. In textbooks of engineering dynamics this is sometimes referred to as ''d'Alembert's principle''.

===Example for 1D motion of a rigid body===
[[File:Dalembert example.JPG|thumb|280x280px|Free body diagram of a wire pulling on a mass with weight W, showing the d’Alembert inertia “force” ma.
]]
To illustrate the concept of ''d'Alembert's principle'', let's use a simple model with a weight''' '''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, suspended from a wire. The weight is subjected to a gravitational force, &lt;math&gt;W=mg&lt;/math&gt;, and a tension force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' '''in the wire. The mass accelerates upward with an acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]] becomes &lt;math&gt;T-W=ma&lt;/math&gt;''''' '''''or &lt;math&gt;T=W+ma&lt;/math&gt;. As an observer with feet planted firmly on the ground, we see that the force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; accelerates the weight, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, but, if we are moving with the wire we don’t see the acceleration, we feel it. The tension in the wire seems to counteract an acceleration “force” &lt;math&gt;ma&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(W/g)a&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Rigid Body in Free Fall with Angular Velocity.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Free body diagram depicting an inertia moment and an inertia force on a rigid body in free fall with an angular velocity.]]

===Example for plane 2D motion of a rigid body===
For a planar rigid body, moving in the plane of the body (the ''x''–''y'' plane), and subjected to forces and torques causing rotation only in this plane, the inertial force is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_i = - m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_c&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the centre of mass of the body, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body. The inertial torque (or moment) is

:&lt;math&gt;T_i = -I\ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. If, in addition to the external forces and torques acting on the body, the inertia force acting through the center of mass is added and the inertial torque is added (acting around the centre of mass is as good as anywhere) the system is equivalent to one in static equilibrium. Thus the equations of static equilibrium

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum F_x &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum F_y &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum T &amp;= 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

hold. The important thing is that &lt;math&gt;\sum T&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of torques (or moments, including the inertial moment and the moment of the inertial force) taken about ''any'' point. The direct application of Newton's laws requires that the angular acceleration equation be applied ''only'' about the center of mass.

===Dynamic equilibrium===
D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system.  Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that is to be
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = (Q_1 + Q^*_1)\delta q_1 + \ldots + (Q_m + Q^*_m)\delta q_m = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
for any set of virtual displacements δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.  This condition yields m equations,
:&lt;math&gt; Q_j + Q^*_j = 0, \quad j=1, \ldots, m,&lt;/math&gt;
which can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} -\frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} = Q_j, \quad j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system.

[[File:Islm.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''model''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct representing economic [[wikt:process|processes]] by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic [[Conceptual model|model]] is a simplified, often [[Mathematical model|mathematical]], framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit [[Coefficient of regression|structural parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various [[exogenous variable]]s, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.&lt;ref&gt; [[Mary S. Morgan]], 2008 "models," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Vivian Walsh 1987. "models and theory," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study.

''Simplification'' is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=M. |authorlink=Milton Friedman |chapter=The Methodology of Positive Economics |title=Essays in Positive Economics |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, [[institution]]al and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely [[random]] fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

''Selection'' is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at, and how they will be compiled. For example, [[inflation]] is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional [[academia|academic]] interest, the use of models include:
* [[Forecasting]] economic activity in a  way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing [[economic policy]] to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence [[corporation|company]] strategy at the level of the firm,  or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* [[Plan]]ning and [[allocation of resources|allocation]], in the case of centrally [[planned economy|planned]] economies, and on a smaller scale in [[logistics]] and [[management]] of [[business]]es.
* In [[finance]] predictive models have been used since the 1980s for [[Trade|trading]] ([[investment]], and [[speculation]]), for example emerging market [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the [[developing nation]] issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term [[risk management]] models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a [[Monte Carlo method]]).

A model establishes an ''[[logical argument|argumentative framework]]'' for applying logic and [[mathematics]] that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be ''theories of everything economic''; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by [[computation]]al infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior.  Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts.  However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful [[approximation]]s of key relationships.  In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

== Types of models ==

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model's intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model's ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent's characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

*'''Stochastic models''' are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by [[Jan Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and later [[Herman Wold|Wold]] are [[autoregressive]] models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and related ones such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and [[GARCH]] models for the modelling of [[heteroskedasticity]].
*'''Non-stochastic models''' may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
*'''Qualitative models''' – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is naturally available.  We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
*An [[accounting]] model is one based on the premise that for every [[credit (finance)|credit]] there is a [[debit]]. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for [[money]] and it is the basis for [[national income]] accounting.  Accounting models are true by [[Convention (norm)|convention]], that is any [[experiment]]al failure to confirm them,  would be attributed to [[fraud]], arithmetic error or an extraneous  injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

*Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[utility]] [[utility maximization|maximization]].  An example of such a model is given by the [[comparative statics]] of [[tax]]ation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x,t) = x p(x) - C(x) - t x \quad&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xp(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue obtained from selling the product, &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of bringing the product to [[Market (economics)|market]] at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The [[profit maximization]] assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate ''x'' if that rate maximizes the firm's profit. Using [[differential calculus]] we can obtain conditions on ''x'' under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for ''x'' is

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial  \pi(x,t)}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial x} -t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:Regarding ''x'' as an implicitly defined function of ''t'' by this equation (see  [[implicit function theorem]]), one concludes that the [[derivative]] of ''x'' with respect to ''t'' has the same sign as

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial^2 x}={\partial^2\pi(x,t)\over \partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:which is negative if the [[Second derivative test|second order condition]]s for a [[local maximum]] are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on [[bounded rationality]].

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by [[Paul Samuelson]], this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an ''operationally meaningful theorem''; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. [[Macroeconomics]] needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as [[Output (economics)|output]], the [[price level]], the [[interest rate]] and so on. Now real output is actually a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as cars, passenger airplanes, [[computer]]s, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly [[price]] is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example [[Wassily Leontief|Leontief]] [[input-output model]]s are of this kind.  However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]]. For this reason, [[macroeconomic model]]s usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as ''output'' or ''price''. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories.  This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by [[econometrics]]. For instance, one ingredient of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian model]] is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(''Y'').  This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[Externality|externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing [[problems with economic models]], or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth.  An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French [[physiocrat]]ic school in the Eighteenth century.  Among these economists, [[François Quesnay]] should be noted, particularly for his development and use of tables he called ''[[Tableau économique|Tableaux économiques]]''.  These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith's 1776 [[Wealth of Nations]]) simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of [[insurance]]. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of [[gambling]], and played an important role both in the development of [[probability theory]] itself and in the development of [[actuarial science]]. Many of the giants of 18th century [[mathematics]] contributed to this field. Around 1730, [[De Moivre]] addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]''. Even earlier (1709), [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] studies problems related to savings and interest in the [[Ars Conjectandi]]. In 1730, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] studied "moral probability" in his book [[Mensura Sortis]], where he introduced what would today be called "logarithmic utility of money" and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical [[St. Petersburg paradox|Saint Petersburg problem]]. All of these developments were summarized by [[Laplace]] in his [[Analytical Theory of Probabilities]] (1812). Clearly, by the time [[David Ricardo]] came along he had a lot of well-established math to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s the [[Brookings Institution]] compared 12 leading [[macroeconomic models]] available at the time. They compared the models' predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a [[monetary]] loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in [[GDP]] after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Jeffrey A.|title=The Sources of Disagreement Among International Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination|work=NBER Working Paper No. 1925 |date=May 1986 |doi=10.3386/w1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to 'fine-tune' the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, ([[Model (economics)#Pitfalls|listed above]]) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of [[unintended consequence]]s, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The [[Lag operator|time lag]] in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to 'steer' them (mostly through [[monetary]] policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. [[Milton Friedman]] has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through [[econometric]] measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model's relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker's actions (through [[game theory]]), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the [[rational expectations]] revolution and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]]'s [[Lucas critique]] of non-[[microfounded]]) models. If the response to the decision maker's actions (and their [[time inconsistency|credibility]]) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

[[Complex systems]] specialist and mathematician [[David Orrell]] wrote on this issue in his book [[Apollo's Arrow]] and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems : (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=FAQ for Apollo's Arrow Future of Everything|author=|date=|website=www.postpythagorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Although the modern mathematical work on [[chaotic systems]] began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in ''[[Econometrica]]'' as early as 1958:
:"Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions....(with the property that)....a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions."
:([[William Baumol]], Econometrica, 26 ''see'': [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/keynotes/Keynote_OXLEY.pdf ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'']).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to [[butterfly effect]]s of initial-condition sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] on his early research in finance: "I quickly dropped... chaos theory (as) it was too easy to construct ‘toy models’ that looked plausible but were useless in practice." {{citation|first=Paul|last=Wilmott|title=Frequently Asked Questions in Quantitative Finance| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4swgjSoMyIC&amp;pg=PT227 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ages/files/NL_Chaos_and_%20Macro%20-%20429%20Essay.pdf|format=PDF|first=Steve|last=Kuchta|title=Nonlinearity and Chaos in Macroeconomics and Financial Markets|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[econometric]] research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 [[Philip Mirowski]] challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased "crusade" against it by [[neo-classical economics]] in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in [[finance]] may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the [[University of Canterbury]] study ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'' concludes that after noise is removed from [[S&amp;P 500]] returns, evidence of [[determinism|deterministic]] chaos ''is'' found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see [[Economic models#Comparison with models in other sciences|Comparison with models in other sciences]] above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of [[free market]] economic thinking is that the market's [[invisible hand]] guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than [[command economy|central planning]] using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model, because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The [[equivalence principle]] is one of the corner-stones of [[gravitation|gravitation theory]].  Different formulations of the '''equivalence principle''' are labeled ''weakest'', ''weak'', ''middle-strong'' and ''strong.''  All of these formulations are based on the empirical equality of inertial mass, gravitational active and passive charges.

The ''weakest'' equivalence principle is restricted to the motion law of a probe point mass in a uniform [[gravitational field]]. Its localization is the ''weak'' equivalence principle that states the existence of a desired local inertial frame at a given world point. This is the case of equations depending on a gravitational field and its first order derivatives, e. g., the equations of mechanics of probe point masses, and the equations of electromagnetic and Dirac fermion fields. The ''middle-strong'' equivalence principle is concerned with any matter, except a gravitational field, while the ''strong'' one is applied to all physical laws.

The above-mentioned variants of the equivalence principle aim to guarantee the transition of [[General Relativity]] to [[Special Relativity]] in a certain [[frame of reference|reference frame]]. However, only the particular ''weakest'' and ''weak'' equivalence principles are true. 
To overcome this difficulty, the equivalence principle can be formulated in geometric terms as follows.

In the spirit of [[Felix Klein|Felix Klein's]] [[Erlanger program]], Special Relativity can be characterized as the [[Klein geometry]] of [[Lorentz group]] invariants. Then the '''geometric equivalence principle''' is formulated to require the existence of Lorentz invariants on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This requirement holds if the [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; admits an atlas with Lorentz transition functions, i.e., a structure group of the associated [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to the Lorentz group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;. By virtue of the well known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], this reduction takes place if and only if the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX/\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\to \scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; possesses a global section, which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the geometric equivalence principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] on a world manifold.

Based on the geometric equivalence principle, gravitation theory is formulated as [[gauge gravitation theory|gauge theory]] where a gravitational field is described as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] responsible for spontaneous breakdown of space-time symmetries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

'''Gauss's Pythagorean right triangle proposal''' is an idea attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] for a method to signal extraterrestrial beings by constructing an immense [[right triangle]] and three squares on the surface of the Earth. The shapes would be a symbolical representation of the [[Pythagorean theorem]], large enough to be seen from the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]].

Although credited in numerous sources as originating with Gauss, with exact details of the proposal set out, the specificity of detail, and even whether Gauss made the proposal, have been called into question. Many of the earliest sources do not actually name Gauss as the originator, instead crediting a "German Astronomer" or using other nonspecific descriptors, and in some cases naming a different author entirely. The details of the proposal also change significantly upon different retellings. Nevertheless, Gauss's writings reveal a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]], and that he did, at the least, propose using amplified light using a [[Heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], his own 1818 invention, to signal supposed inhabitants of the Moon.

==Proposal==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is credited with an 1820 proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Glenn|last=Garelik |first2=J.

Details vary between sources, but typically the "drawing" was to be constructed on the [[Geography of Russia#Tundra|Siberian tundra]], and made up of vast strips of pine forest forming the right triangle's borders, with the interior of the drawing and exterior squares composed of fields of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kahn|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEH_rHkgaogC&amp;pg=PA958|date=1996|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauss is said to have been convinced that Mars harbored intelligent life and that this geometric figure, invoking the Pythagorean theorem through the squares on the outside borders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Universe Is Not Ours Alone; From the edge of the galaxy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/09/29/archives/the-universe-is-not-oues-alone-from-the-edge-of-the-galaxy.html|subscription=yes|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter S.

==Attribution==
The specificity of the proposal's details as it appears in most later sources—even its attribution to Gauss—is called into question in [[University of Notre Dame]] Professor Michael J. Crowe's 1986 book, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900'', in which he surveys the origins of the Gauss proposal and observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of this proposal&amp;nbsp;... can be traced through two dozen or more pluralist writings reaching back to the first half of the nineteenth century. When this is done, however, it turns out that the story exists in almost as many forms as its retellings. Furthermore, these versions share one characteristic: Never is reference supplied to where in the writings of Gauss&amp;nbsp;... the [proposal] appear[s]!&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some early sources explored by Crowe for the attribution and form of Gauss's proposal include Austrian astronomer, [[Joseph Johann Littrow]]'s statement in ''Wunder des Himmels'' that "one of our most distinguished geometers"&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; proposed that a geometric figure "for example the well known so-called square of the hypotenuse, be laid out on a large scale, say on a particular broad plain of the earth".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; and Patrick Scott's ''Love in the Moon'', in which a "learned man" is described as proposing a signal formed by a "great plantation of tree" in the form of "47th Proposition of Euclid" in "the great African dessert {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; In ''[[Chambers's Edinburgh Journal]]'' it was written that a Russian savant had proposed to "communicate with the moon by cutting a large figure of the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid on the plains of Siberia, which, he said, any fool would understand".&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

In the writings of astronomers [[Asaph Hall]] and of [[Norman Lockyer]], each refer separately to a "German Astronomer" who proposed the method of contact be by "fire signals" from Siberia. Writing in 1902, [[Simon Newcomb]] placed the origin of a Siberian triangle "several hundred miles in extent" not with Gauss, but at the feet of German astronomer [[Franz Xaver von Zach]]. In lectures presented by [[François Arago]] at the [[Paris Observatory]], he named Siberia as the location of an extraterrestrial signaling project advanced by an unnamed "German geometer",&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; but that the signaling method was to be through the use of mirrors, rather than any large symbol drawn upon the Earth.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Despite this version's departure from a geometric figure, the appearance of mirrors as a signaling device has a connection with Gauss's background. Gauss invented the [[Heliotrope (instrument)|Heliotrope]] in 1818,&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight in a manner allowing a {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} square mirror to be seen {{convert|8|mi|km}} away even in sunny weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New American encyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-lDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63|date=1872|editors=George Ripley &amp; Charles A. Dana|volume=IX|publisher=D. Appleton|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss wrote of the heliotrope's potential as a celestial signaling device in a March 25, 1822 letter to [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]], by which he reveals a belief and interest in finding a method to contact [[extraterrestrial life]]: "With 100 separate mirrors, each of 16 square feet, used conjointly, one would be able to send good heliotrope-light to the moon&amp;nbsp;.... This would be a discovery even greater than that of America, if we could get in touch with our neighbors on the moon."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Finally, in the October 1826 issue of the ''[[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]]'' an unnamed author wrote that in a conversation with [[Franz von Gruithuisen]], Gauss stated words to the effect that "the plan of erecting a geometrical figure on the plains of Siberia corresponded with his opinion, because, according to his view a correspondence with the inhabitants of the moon could only be begun by means of such mathematical contemplations and ideas, which we and they have in common."&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt; Crowe concluded in sum that his review of earliest sources failed to confirm the detail of the proposal and Gauss as its author, but that his origination of the idea was not unlikely given the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Crowe" /&gt;

* '''Gossen's First Law''' is the [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|"law" of diminishing marginal utility]]: that [[marginal utility|marginal utilities]] are diminishing across the ranges relevant to decision-making.
* '''[[Gossen's second law|Gossen's Second Law]]''', which presumes that [[utility]] is at least weakly quantified, is that in equilibrium an agent will allocate expenditures so that the ratio of marginal utility to price (marginal cost of acquisition) is equal across all [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]].

Not only does the initial intensity of pleasure become smaller but also the duration of the enjoyment becomes shorter, so that satiety is reached sooner. Moreover, the sooner the repetition, the smaller becomes the initial intensity as well as the duration of the enjoyment." (p.lxxx)

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met. Copyright in such a case protects the particular literary or pictorial expression chosen by the author. But it gives the copyright owner no exclusive rights concerning the idea, method or system involved. ''CIT : [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ31.pdf US Copyright Office], circular 31 reviewed: 01 ⁄ 2012 P&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In the case of copyright law, it is the work that realizes the idea that is protected (i.e. a document), and it is the act of recording that work that fixes copyright in the item itself.'' – CIT : [https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/protect/p21_protecting_ideas The UK Copyright Service], Issued: 17th May 2007, Last amended: 17th May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''(…) there is likely to be an infringement of copyright if the way the information is expressed in the copyrighted work used without the permission of the copyright owner and no exception to infringement applies to the use.

&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectual property consists of products, work or processes that you have created and which give you a competitive advantage. There are 3 subcategories : '''Industrial property''' : inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs, new varieties of plants and geographic indications of origin '''Artistic work''' protected by copyright: original literary and artistic works, music, television broadcasting, software, databases, architectural designs, advertising creations and multimedia '''Commercial strategies''' : trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements, or rapid production.'' – CIT : [https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/start-grow/intellectual-property-rights/index_en.htm Intellectual property rights], [https://europa.eu/ European Union], Updated 22/01/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''instantiation principle''' or '''principle of instantiation''' or '''principle of exemplification''' is the [[concept]] in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]] (first put forward by [[David Malet Armstrong]]) that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified [[property (philosophy)|properties]] (or [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.

To make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The property of being red would exist even if all red things were to be destroyed, because it has been instantiated. This broadens the range of properties which exist if the principle is true. 

Those who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as ''in re'' (in thing or in reality) realists or '[[immanent realist]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''philosophical interpretation''' is the assignment of meanings to various concepts, symbols, or [[wikt:object|objects]] under consideration. Two broad types of interpretation can be distinguished: interpretations of physical objects, and interpretations of concepts ([[Conceptual model]]).

== Conceptual interpretations ==

=== Aesthetic interpretation ===
{{Main|Aesthetic interpretation}}

Interpretation is related to perceiving the things. An [[aesthetic]] interpretation is an explanation of the [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses an understanding of a work of art, a poem, performance, or piece of literature. There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'. Some people, instead of interpreting work of art, believe in interpreting artist himself. It pretty much means "how or what do I believe about (subject)"&lt;ref&gt;http://classof1.com/homework_answers/philosophy/aesthetics_interpretation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial interpretation ===
{{Main|Judicial interpretation|Textualism|Strict constructionism|5=Originalism|6=Prudentialism }}

A judicial interpretation is a conceptual interpretation that explains how the judiciary should interpret the law, particularly [[constitution]]al documents and [[legislation]] (see [[statutory interpretation]]).

=== Logical interpretation ===
{{Main|Logical interpretation}}

In [[logic]], an interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the [[Symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a language. The [[formal languages]] used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called ''formal semantics''.

=== Religious interpretation ===
{{Main|Religious interpretation}}

Religious interpretation and similarly religious self-interpretation define a section of religion-related studies (theology, comparative religion, reason) where attention is given to aspects of perception—where religious symbolism and the self-image of all those who hold religious views have important bearing on how others perceive their particular belief system and its adherents.

== Scientific interpretation ==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}

=== Descriptive interpretation ===
{{Main|Descriptive interpretation}}

An interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' (also called a ''factual interpretation'') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, the name of a physical object, or observable property. A descriptive interpretation is a type of interpretation used in science and logic to talk about empirical entities.

=== Scientific model ===
{{Main|Scientific modeling}}

When scientists attempt to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences, they use an interpretation to [[Scientific model|model reality]], in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will serve as a conceptual model of reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.

A '''knowledge arena''' is a virtual space where individuals can manipulate [[concept]]s and relationships to form a [[concept map]]. Individuals using a computer with appropriate software can represent concepts and the relationships between concepts in a node-relationship-node formalism. The process of thinking about the concepts and making associations between them has been called "off-loading" by McAleese.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R ( 1988) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: reflection in action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6,1,1&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concept map]] is a form of  a semantic network or semantic graph. It is formally based on [[graph theory]]. In the concept map, concepts are represented by nodes. The relationship between nodes are represented by ''typed links'' or ''edges''.  (See [[Graph theory]].) In creating a map or graphic representation of what is known an individual intentionally interacts with the graphical interface or map and through a reflective process adds nodes (concepts) and /or adds relationships (edges or typed links) or modifies existing node-relationship-node instances. It is likely that the process of engaging with concepts and relationships between concepts brings about the creation of understandings as well as making the understandings explicit.

Many different claims have been made for the utility of the [[concept map]]. The interactive and reflective nature of map creation is highlighted by the use of the description Knowledge Arena. Although maps may represent what an individual knows at a point in time; it is likely that by interacting with the concepts and relationships in the knowledge arena individual continues to create and modify what that individual ''knows''.

In [[philosophy]] and [[media studies]], a '''knowledge space''' is described as an emerging anthropological space in which the knowledge of individuals becomes the primary focus for social structure, values, and beliefs. The concept is put forward and explored by philosopher and media critic [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] in his 1997 book ''Collective Intelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Levy, ''Collective Intelligence'', trans. Robert Bononno, Perseus Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropological Space ==
Levy's notion of the "knowledge space" relies on his conception of anthropological spaces, which he defines as "a system of proximity (space) unique to the world of humanity (anthropological), and thus dependent on human technologies, significations, language, culture, conventions, representations, and emotions" (5). Building on the language of the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], he states that "anthropological spaces in themselves are neither infrastructures nor superstructures but planes of existence, frequencies, velocities, determined within the social spectrum" (147). Each space contains "worlds of signification" (149) by which humans come to understand and make sense of the world. Furthermore, although one space may dominate, many spaces can and do exist simultaneously.

Levy describes three existing anthropological spaces. They are:
# ''Earth'' - This space corresponds with hunter-gatherer eras in which people identify themselves by familial relationships, derive meaning via intimate connection with the signifier, and where conceptions of time are driven by reminiscence. Passed down narratives become the guiding instruments that exist within the body of the community.
# ''Territorial'' - This space corresponds to the rise of civilizations and the insistent division of things and signs. Within this space history becomes closed and authoritative.  Within territorial space people identify themselves by property ownership and nationality and look to religion for guidance, with the book become the substrate of choice.
# ''Commodity'' - This space corresponds to the rise of industrial revolution and world-markets in which people begin to identify themselves through one's career and wealth. In this space, meaning becomes illusory, our sense of time becomes abstract and uniform (through the use of clocks) while our sense of space becomes configured into a network. Statistics and probability become guiding concepts and indexes and networks of information becomes the substrate through which knowledge is passed on. (175,210)

==The emerging knowledge space==
The knowledge space is an emerging anthropological space which, while it has always existed (139), is only now coming into fruition as a guiding space of humanity. In this space, singularities (individuals) are recognized as singularities and knowledge becomes the guiding value for humanity. Since all human experience represents unique knowledge, within the knowledge space all individuals are valued for their unique knowledge regardless of race (earth space), nationality (territorial space), or economic status (commodity space). Within this space static identity gives way to the "quantum identities" as individuals become participates and the distinction between of "us" and "them" disappears (159). Instead, humanity forms "collective intelligences" in which knowledge is valued and freely traded. What is "real" becomes "that which implies the practical activity, intellectual and imaginary, of living subjects" (168). Life, experiences, and knowledge become the underlying and ever changing guiding path for human societies.

== Relation to Technology ==
Levy's theories rely heavily on the technological developments of the 1990s, particularly the rise of biotechnology, nanotechnology, the Internet, new media and information technologies. In chapter 3, he describes how technologies have made a shift from the molar to the molecular (a move which makes literal a distinction by Delueze and Guattari) in that technologies now handle units as individuals (his term is "singularities") rather than in mass. He suggests that this mirrors our rising recognition of the individuals as singularities rather than massive conglomerated groups.

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

{{Distinguish|Landau principle}}
'''Landauer's principle''' is a [[Principle#Principle as scientific law|physical principle]] pertaining to the lower [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] limit of [[Energy conservation|energy consumption]] of [[computation]]. It holds that "any logically irreversible manipulation of [[Information#As a property in physics|information]], such as the erasure of a [[bit]] or the merging of two [[computation]] paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding [[entropy]] increase in non-information-bearing [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the information-processing apparatus or its environment".&lt;ref name = bennett&gt;{{Citation |arxiv=physics/0210005 |title=Notes on Landauer's principle, Reversible Computation and Maxwell's Demon |authorlink=Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist) |author=Charles H. Bennett |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=501–510 |year=2003 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos576/papers/bennett03.pdf |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(03)00039-X|bibcode=2003SHPMP..34..501B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

A '''league system''' is a [[hierarchy]] of [[sports league|leagues]] in a sport. They are often called '''pyramids''', due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system. League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries.

In [[association football]], [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], league systems are usually connected by the process of [[promotion and relegation]], in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted (advanced to the next level of the system) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated (move down to a lower division). This process can be automatic each year, or can require playoffs.

In North America, league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation. Most [[professional sports]] are divided into [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league]]s. [[Baseball]] and association football (known as soccer in North America) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies, each managed by a governing body ([[Minor League Baseball]], an organization under the authority of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], governs baseball leagues; the [[United States Soccer Federation]] designates the American soccer pyramid.) [[Ice hockey]]'s professional minor league system is linear, with one league at most of the four levels of the game; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by [[collective bargaining agreement]]s and affiliation deals between the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and [[ECHL]].

[[Gridiron football]] does not operate on a league system. Different professional leagues play by [[List of gridiron football rules|very different sets of rules]] in different seasons (the [[National Football League|NFL]] plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall, while [[arena football]] and the [[indoor American football|minor indoor leagues]] each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer). There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game (most recently with 2017's [[The Spring League]]); none so far have been able to balance the major leagues' requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

'''Marginal demand'''  in [[economics]] is the change in demand for a product or service in response to a specific change in its price.

Normally, as prices for goods or service rise, demand falls, and conversely, as prices for goods or services fall, demand rises.

A product or service where price changes cause a relatively big change in demand is said to have ''elastic'' demand. A product or service where price changes cause a relatively small change in demand is said to have  ''inelastic'' demand. See [[Elasticity of demand]].

In [[economics]] and in particular [[neoclassical economics]], the '''marginal product''' or '''marginal physical productivity''' of an input ([[factor of production]]) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm's labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Making of the Classical Theory of Economic Growth|last=Brewer

 |year=2010
 |publisher =Routledge
 |isbn=0415486203
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marginal product of a given input can be expressed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as:
:&lt;math&gt;MP =  \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the firm's use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of the "product" is typically defined ignoring [[externalities|external costs and benefits]].

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal "units" are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical [[derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to that input. Suppose a firm's output ''Y'' is given by the production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' and ''L'' are inputs to production (say, capital and labor). Then the marginal product of capital (''MPK'') and marginal product of labor (''MPL'') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MPL=\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}&lt;/math&gt;

In the "law" of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]], the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has ''decreased'' the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing [[marginal productivity of labor]].

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the [[total product]] curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of [[perfect competition|competitive markets]], the [[marginal product of labor]] equals the [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good,  the [[marginal product of capital]] equals its [[rate of profit|rate of return]]. As was shown in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

'''Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP)'''

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2304">As defined by the [[Austrian School|Austrian School of economics]] the '''marginal use''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  The useful''ness'' of the marginal use thus corresponds to the [[marginal utility]] of the good or service.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch"&gt;Mc Culloch, James Huston; [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mcCulloch.pdf “The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use and of Ordinal Marginal Utility”,] ''[[Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie]]'' 37 (1977) #3&amp;amp;4 (September).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the assumption that an agent is [[Rational choice theory|economically rational]], each increase would be put to the specific, feasible, previously unrealized use of greatest priority, and each decrease would result in abandonment of the use of lowest priority amongst the uses to which the good or service had been put.&lt;ref name="weiser_ein" /&gt;  And, in the absence of a complementarity across uses, [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|the “law” of diminishing marginal utility]] will obtain.&lt;ref name="georgescu-rogen"&gt;[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen, Nicholas]]; “Utility”, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

The Austrian School of economics explicitly arrives at its conception of marginal utility as the utility of the marginal use, and “Grenznutzen” (the Austrian School term from which “marginal utility” was originally derived in translation&lt;ref&gt;Streissler, E., “Wieser, Friedrich, Freiherr von”, [[The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4  (1987), p. 921.&lt;/ref&gt;) literally means ''border-use''; other schools usually do not make an explicit connection.&lt;ref name="mc_culloch" /&gt;

'''Negative energy''' is a concept used in [[physics]] to explain the nature of certain [[field (physics)|fields]], including the [[gravitational field]] and various [[quantum field]] effects.

In more speculative theories, negative energy is involved in [[wormhole]]s which may allow for [[time travel]] and [[warp drive]]s for faster-than-light space travel.

==Gravitational energy==
{{Main|Gravitational energy}}
The strength of the gravitational attraction between two objects represents the amount of [[gravitational energy]] in the field which attracts them towards each other. When they are infinitely far apart, the gravitational attraction and hence energy approach zero. As two such massive objects move towards each other, the motion accelerates under [[gravity]] causing an increase in the positive kinetic energy of the system. At the same time, the gravitational attraction - and hence energy - also increase in magnitude, but the [[law of energy conservation]] requires that the net energy of the system not change. This issue can only be resolved if the change in gravitational energy is negative, thus cancelling out the positive change in kinetic energy. Since the gravitational energy is getting stronger, this decrease can only mean that it is negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[universe]] in which positive energy dominates will eventually collapse in a "[[big crunch]]", while an "open" universe in which negative energy dominates will either expand indefinitely or eventually disintegrate in a "[[big rip]]". In the [[zero-energy universe]] model ("flat" or "Euclidean"), the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly [[zero]]: its amount of positive energy in the form of [[matter]] is exactly cancelled out by its negative energy in the form of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''The Grand Design'', 2010, Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum field effects==
Negative energies and negative energy density are consistent with [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual particles===
{{Main|Virtual particles}}
In quantum theory, the [[uncertainty principle]] allows the vacuum of space to be filled with [[virtual particles|virtual]] particle-antiparticle pairs which appear spontaneously and exist for only a short time before, typically, annihilating themselves again. Some of these virtual particles can have negative energy. Their behaviour plays a role in several important phenomena, as described below.

===Casimir effect===
{{Main|Casimir effect}}
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta which can exist between them. This in turn restricts the types and hence number and density of [[virtual particle]] pairs which can form in the intervening vacuum and can result in a negative energy density. This causes an attractive force between the plates, which has been measured.&lt;ref name="fordroman"&gt;Ford and Roman 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawking radiation===
{{Main|Hawking radiation}}
[[Virtual particles]] with negative energy can exist for a short period. This phenomenon is a part of the mechanism involved in [[Hawking radiation]] by which [[black hole]]s evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''A Brief History of Time'', Bantam 1988, Pages 105-107. {{ISBN|0-593-01518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squeezed light===
{{Main|Squeezed light}}
It is possible to arrange multiple beams of laser light such that destructive [[quantum interference]] suppresses the [[vacuum fluctuations]]. Such a squeezed vacuum state involves negative energy. The repetitive waveform of light leads to alternating regions of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

===Dirac sea===
{{Main|Dirac sea}}
According to the theory of the [[Dirac sea]], developed by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930, the [[vacuum]] of space is full of negative energy. This theory was developed to explain the anomaly of negative-energy [[quantum states]] predicted by the [[Dirac equation]].

The Dirac sea theory correctly predicted the existence of [[antimatter]] two years prior to the discovery of the [[positron]] in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. However, the Dirac sea theory treats antimatter as a hole where there is the absence of a particle rather than as a real particle. [[Quantum field theory]] (QFT), developed in the 1930s, deals with antimatter in a way that treats antimatter as made of real particles rather than the absence of particles, and treats a vacuum as being empty of particles rather than full of negative-energy particles like in the Dirac sea theory.

Quantum field theory has displaced the Dirac sea theory as a more popular explanation of these aspects of physics. Both the Dirac sea theory and quantum field theory are equivalent by means of a [[Bogoliubov transformation]], so the Dirac sea can be viewed as an alternative formulation of quantum field theory, and is thus consistent with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López de Recalde|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=The Standard Electro-Weak Theory, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=mNevDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=dirac+sea+equivalent+transformation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dirac%20sea%20equivalent%20transformation&amp;f=false|location=Morrisville, North Carolina|publisher=LuLu Press, Inc.|page=65|isbn=978-1-365-65887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculative suggestions==
===Wormholes===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Negative energy appears in the speculative theory of [[wormhole]]s, where it is needed to keep the wormhole open. A wormhole directly connects two locations which may be separated arbitrarily far apart in both space and time, and in principle allows near-instantaneous travel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1269288/STEPHEN-HAWKING-How-build-time-machine.html How to build a time machine]", ''Mail Online'' 27 April 2010(retrieved 4 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp drive===
{{Main|Warp drive}}
A theoretical principle for a [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) warp drive for spaceships has been suggested, involving negative energy. The [[Alcubierre drive]] comprises a solution to Einstein's equations of [[general relativity]], in which a bubble of spacetime is moved rapidly by expanding space behind it and shrinking space in front of it.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

'''Negative luminescence''' is a physical phenomenon by which an electronic device emits less [[thermal radiation]] when an [[electric current]] is passed through it than it does in [[thermal equilibrium]] (current off). When viewed by a [[thermal camera]], an operating negative luminescent device looks colder than its environment.

== Physics ==
Negative luminescence is most readily observed in [[semiconductor]]s. Incoming [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed in the material by the creation of an [[electron–hole pair]]. An [[electric field]] is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before they have a chance to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.

Negative luminescence has also been observed in semiconductors in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the junction of a diode is not necessary and the effect can be observed in bulk material. A term that has been applied to this type of negative luminescence is ''galvanomagnetic luminescence''.

Negative luminescence might appear to be a violation of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]. This is not true, as the law only applies in [[thermal equilibrium]].

Another term that has been used to describe negative luminescent devices is "[[Emissivity]] switch", as an electric current changes the effective emissivity.

== History ==
This effect was first seen by Russian physicists in the 1960s in A.F.Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, Leningrad, Russia. Subsequently, it was studied in [[semiconductors]] such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), [[germanium]] (Ge) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) by workers in [[West Germany]], [[Ukraine]] (Institute of Semiconductor Physics, [[Kiev]]), Japan ([[Chiba University]]) and the United States. It was first observed in the mid-infrared (3-5 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) in the more convenient [[diode]] structures in InSb [[heterostructure]] diodes by workers at the [[Defence Research Agency]], [[Great Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (now [[QinetiQ]]). These British workers later demonstrated LWIR band (8-12&amp;nbsp;µm) negative luminescence using [[HgCdTe|mercury cadmium telluride]] [[diode]]s.

Later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington DC]], started work on negative luminescence in [[mercury cadmium telluride]] (HgCdTe). The phenomenon has since been observed by several university groups around the world.

'''Negative pledge''' is a provision in a [[contract]] which prohibits a party to the contract from creating any [[security interest]]s over certain property specified in the provision.

Negative pledges often appear in security documents, where they operate to prohibit the person who is granting the security interest from creating any other security interests over the same property, which might compete with (or rank ''[[pari passu]]'' with) the security of the first [[secured creditor]] under the security document in which the negative pledge appears.

In Australia, negative pledge lending took off after a substantial deal by [[Hanson Australia|Pioneer Concrete]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trevor Sykes]], ''The Bold Riders'', second edition, 1996, {{ISBN|1-86448-184-6}}, pages 7-10&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a new way of lending, which allowed the banks to lend to corporations, something previously the domain of life insurers.

Negative pledge clauses are almost universal in modern unsecured commercial loan documents. The purpose is to ensure that a borrower, having taken out an [[unsecured loan]], cannot subsequently take out another loan with a different lender, securing the subsequent loan on the specified assets. If the borrower could do this, the original lender would be disadvantaged because the subsequent lender would have first call on the assets in an [[event of default]].

'''Grue''' and '''bleen''' are examples of logical [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' to illustrate the "'''new [[Problem of induction|riddle of induction]]'''". These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but [[Hilary Putnam]] and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as "green." For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are [[Scientific law|law-like]] and which are not.&lt;ref name="Goodman.1946"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nelson Goodman| title=A Query on Confirmation| journal=The Journal of Philosophy|date=Jul 1946| volume=43| number=14| pages=383–385| url=http://wordsmatter.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Nelson%20Goodman%20-%20A%20Query%20on%20Confirmation.pdf| doi=10.2307/2020332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Goodman's construction and use of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in [[analytic philosophy|conceptual analysis]].

==Grue and bleen defined==
Goodman defined '''grue''' relative to an arbitrary but fixed time ''t'' as follows:&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Historically, Goodman used ''"[[V-E day]]"'' and ''"a certain time t"'' in ''A Query on Confirmation'' (p. 383) and ''Fact, fiction, and forecast'' (3rd ed. 1973, p. 73), respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; An object is grue [[if and only if]] it is observed before ''t'' and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is '''bleen''' if and only if it is observed before ''t'' and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP|title=Nelson Goodman|url-id=relativism|date=Apr 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time ''t'', say January 1, {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}. &lt;!-- The expression gives the current year plus ten, for a date guaranteed to be in the future no matter when this page is retrieved. --&gt; For all green things we observe up to time ''t'', such as [[emerald]]s and well-watered [[grass]], both the predicates ''green'' and ''grue'' apply.  Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time ''t'',   such as [[bluebird]]s or [[blue flower]]s, both the predicates ''blue'' and ''bleen'' apply. On January 2,  {{#expr:{{#time:Y}} + 10}}, however,  emeralds and well-watered grass are ''bleen'' and bluebirds or blue flowers are ''grue''.  Clearly, the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates ''green'' and ''blue'' up until some future time ''t''. From our current perspective (i.e., before time ''t''), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future:  ''green'' and ''blue'' or ''grue'' and ''bleen''?

==The new riddle of induction==
In this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and thereby illustrate their [[Philosophy|philosophical importance]].&lt;ref name="Goodman.1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godfrey-Smith"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Godfrey-Smith|title=Theory and Reality|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate=23 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-30063-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The old problem of induction and its dissolution===
Goodman poses [[Hume's problem of induction]] as a problem of the validity of the [[prediction]]s we make.  Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make?  We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences.  Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind).  The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.

Goodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one.  He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification.  His view is that Hume has identified something deeper.  To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a [[Deductive system|system of rules of deduction]].  For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice.  The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences.  Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.

In the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman.  However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations.  It is with this turn that ''grue'' and ''bleen'' have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.

===Projectible predicates===
[[File:US government example for Goodman's new riddle of induction_svg.svg|thumb|500px|US government example for time-dependent predicates: [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|Before March 1797]], arbitrarily many observations would support both version of the prediction ''"The [[United States Armed Forces|US forces]] were always [[commander-in-chief#United States|commanded]] by { {{su|p=[[George Washington]]|b=[[President of the United States|the &amp;nbsp; US &amp;nbsp; President]]}} }, hence they will be commanded by him in the future"'', which today is known as { {{su|p=false|b=true}} }, similar to ''"Emeralds were always { {{su|p=grue|b=green}} }, hence they will be so in the future"''.]]
The new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish ''lawlike'' from ''non-lawlike'' generalizations.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are capable of confirmation while ''non-lawlike'' generalizations are not.  ''Lawlike'' generalizations are required for making predictions.  Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not ''lawlike'' but accidental.  The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity.  The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.

What then makes some generalizations ''lawlike'' and others accidental?  This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in ''lawlike'' generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as ''Goodman's paradox'', is as follows.  Consider the evidence that all [[emerald]]s examined thus far have been green.  This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is ''lawlike'' or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction.  Goodman observed that (assuming ''t'' has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is ''grue''.  Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be ''grue''.  The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' from non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen''.

Hume, Goodman argues, missed this problem.  We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. ''Lawlike'' predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that ''lawlike'' predictions are based on projectible predicates such as ''green'' and ''blue'' and not on non-projectible predicates such as ''grue'' and ''bleen'' and what makes predicates projectible is their ''entrenchment'', which depends on their successful past projections.  Thus, ''grue'' and ''bleen'' function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.

==Responses==
The most obvious response is to point to the artificially [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] definition of grue.  The notion of predicate ''entrenchment'' is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work.  If we take ''grue'' and ''bleen'' as primitive predicates, we can define green as "''grue'' if first observed before ''t'' and ''bleen'' otherwise", and likewise for blue.  To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Another proposed resolution of the [[paradox]] (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate ''entrenchment'' is that "''x'' is grue" is not solely a predicate of ''x'', but of ''x'' and a time ''t''—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time ''t'', but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect "''x'' is grue" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why "''x'' is green" is ''not'' considered a predicate of a particular time ''t''—the more common definition of ''green'' does not require any mention of a time ''t'', but the definition ''grue'' does. As we have just seen, this response also [[Begging the question|begs the question]] because ''blue'' can be defined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'', which explicitly refer to time.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swinburne===
[[Richard Swinburne]] gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of ''grue'' and ''bleen'' by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, ''can'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like ''grue'', ''cannot'' be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of ''x'' to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether ''x'' is being observed before or after time ''t''. Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates ''grue'' and ''bleen'', this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas ''grue'' is merely locational. He concludes that if some ''x'''s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time ''t'' shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Swinburne, 'Grue', Analysis, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Mar., 1968), pp. 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carnap===
[[Rudolf Carnap]] responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rudolf Carnap| title=On the Application of Inductive Logic| journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research| year=1947| volume=8| pages=133–148| url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~franz/Confirmation%20and%20Induction/PDFs/Rudolf%20Carnap%20-%20On%20the%20Application%20of%20Inductive%20Logic.pdf| doi=10.2307/2102920}} Here: p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of ''degree of confirmation'' ''c''(''h'',''e'') of a given hypothesis ''h'' by a given evidence ''e''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;p. 138; later on p. 143f, he uses another variant, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''h'',''e''), for which he gives a formula to compute actual values; different from Laplace's [[Rule of Succession]]. See Carnap's book ''Studies in inductive logic and probability'', Vol.1. University of California Press, 1971, for more details, in particular sect.IV.16 for ''c'', and app.A.1 for ''c''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''h'' and ''e'' are logical formulas expressed in a simple language ''L'' which allows for
* multiple quantification ("for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' such that ..."),
* unary and binary predicate symbols (properties and relations), and
* an equality relation "=".
The universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions ("like space-time points in our actual world") rather than extended physical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;This might be seen as corresponding to [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition 1|Tractatus]], Nr.1.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap requires the following semantic properties:
* Atomic sentences must be logically independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tractatus Nr.1.21&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, different constant symbols must designate different and entirely separate individuals.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, if ''a'' and ''b'' had a part in common, then "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is not warm" would be an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, different predicates must be logically independent.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, "is a raven" and "is a bird" cannot both be admitted predicates, since the former would exclude the negation of the latter. As another example, "is warm" and "is warmer than" cannot both be predicates, since "''a'' is warm and ''b'' is warmer than ''a'' and ''b'' is not warm" is an impossible combination.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap argues (p. 135) that logical independence is required for deductive logic as well, in order for the set of [[analytic-synthetic distinction#Frege and Carnap revise the Kantian definition|analytical sentences]] to be decidable.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The qualities and relations designated by the predicates must be simple, i.e. they must not be analyzable into simpler components.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.136&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently, Carnap had in mind an [[irreflexive]], [[partial order|partial]], and [[well-founded]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"... carry the analysis [of complex predicates into simpler components] to the end", p.137&lt;/ref&gt; [[order theory|order]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Carnap doesn't consider predicates that are mutually definable by each other, leading to a [[preorder]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''is simpler than''.
* The set of primitive predicates in ''L'' must be complete, i.e. every respect in which two positions in the universe may be found to differ by direct observation, must be expressible in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.138&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:
# Purely qualitative properties; that is, properties expressible without using individual constants, but not without primitive predicates,
# Purely positional properties; that is, properties expressible without primitive predicates, and
# Mixed properties; that is, all remaining expressible properties.
To illuminate this taxonomy, let ''x'' be a variable and ''a'' a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be "''x'' is blue or ''x'' is non-warm", an example of 2. "''x'' = ''a''", and an example of 3. "''x'' is red and not ''x'' = ''a''".

Based on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property ''W'' as follows: the higher the relative frequency of ''W'' in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property ''W''. Carnap suggests "as a tentative answer" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Carnap (1947), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quine===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] discusses an approach to consider only "[[natural kind]]s" as projectible predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Nicholas Rescher|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Quine |first=W. V. |year=1969 |contribution=Natural Kinds |title=Ontological Relativity and other Essays |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=114 }}&lt;!---chapter=5---&gt;&lt;!---According to Quine's foreword to the latter book (p. 6 in the german translation), the reprint was issued earlier than the original.---&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[raven paradox]] by defining two predicates ''F'' and ''G'' to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim "each ''F'' is a ''G''".&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as "is a raven", and "is black") need not be projectible,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Observing a black raven is considered to confirm the claim "all ravens are black", while the [[contraposition|logically equivalent]] claim "all non-black things are non-ravens" is not considered to be confirmed by observing e.g. a green leaf.&lt;/ref&gt; while Goodman's paradox shows that "is green" is projectible, but "is grue" is not.

Next, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of ''similarity''. Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a ''natural kind'', but grue emeralds are not.  Quine investigates "the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind".&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[negation]], [[disjunction]].  However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to ''similarity'' or ''kind'';&lt;ref group=note&gt;Defining two things to be similar if they have all, or most, or many, properties in common doesn't make sense if properties, like [[mathematical set]]s, take things in every possible combination. (Quine, 1970, p. 43. Assuming a finite universe of ''n'' things, any two of them belong to exactly 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sup&gt; sets, and share exactly that number of [[extensional]] properties. [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]] called this the "[[Ugly duckling theorem]]".)&lt;/ref&gt; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.

'''Relation between similarity and kind'''

Assuming finitely many ''kinds'' only, the notion of ''similarity'' can be defined by that of ''kind'': an object ''A'' is more similar to ''B'' than to ''C'' if ''A'' and ''B'' belong jointly to more kinds&lt;ref group=note&gt;Rather than arbitrary sets&lt;/ref&gt; than ''A'' and ''C'' do.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quines uses this ternary relation in order to admit different levels of similarity, such that e.g. red things can be more similar to each other than just colored things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define ''kind'' by ''similarity''.  Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 44"/&gt; (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)

An alternative approach inspired by [[Carnap]] defines a natural kind to be a [[set (mathematics)|set]] whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally: A set ''K'' is a kind if ∀''Y'' ∉ ''K''. ∃ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''. ∀ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''K''.  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is more similar to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than to ''Y'').&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Goodman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson Goodman| title=The Structure of Appearance| year=1951}} Here: p.163f.&lt;/ref&gt; argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Each member of the set resembles each other member in being red, or in being round, or in being wooden, or even in several of these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; while "surely it is not what anyone means by a kind".&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set contains e.g. yellow [[croquet]] balls and red rubber balls, but not yellow rubber balls.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

While neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if ''A'' is reassessed to be more similar to ''C'' than to ''B'' rather than the other way around, the assignment of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 45"/&gt;

'''Basic importance of similarity and kind'''

In language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things [[Reference#Semantics|referred]] to.  [[Language acquisition|Learning]] to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 42, 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Every reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&lt;ref name="Quine, 1970, p. 42"/&gt; This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances.  Already [[Heraclitus]]' famous saying "No man ever steps in the same river twice" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.

'''Genesis of similarity and kind'''

In a [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity.  It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic,&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; cf. bird example.

Induction itself is essentially [[Classical conditioning|animal expectation]] or habit formation.
[[Ostensive definition|Ostensive learning]]&lt;ref&gt;Investigated in more detail in {{cite book|author=Willard Van Orman Quine |title=The Roots of Reference | location=La Salle, Illinois | publisher=Open Court Publishing Co. |year=1974}} Sect.11&lt;/ref&gt;
is a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the "brute irrationality of our sense of similarity" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Quine seems to allude to Vico's [[Giambattista Vico#The verum factum principle|verum factum principle]] here.&lt;/ref&gt;
Why inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical [[problem of induction]].  Quine, following [[Satosi Watanabe|Watanabe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1=Stanislas I. Dockx |editor2=Paul Bernays |editor2link=Paul Bernays |title=Information and Prediction in Science |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/41130 |location=New York |year=1965 |publisher=Academic Press | oclc=522269 | lccn=64-24655 | author=Satosi Watanabe |authorlink=Satosi Watanabe |chapter=Une Explication Mathématique du Classement d'Objets | pages=39&amp;mdash;76}} Here: p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Quine, 1970, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Demonstrated by psychological experiments e.g. about classification of previously unseen [[Greeble (psychology)|artificial objects]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar predicates used in philosophical analysis==

===Quus===
In his book ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language'', [[Saul Kripke]] proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed "[[Kripkenstein]]" by some&lt;ref&gt;John P. Burgess, Gideon Rosen (1999). ''A subject with no object: strategies for nominalistic interpretation of mathematics'', p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0-19-825012-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[private language argument]]. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called ''quus'', which is identical with "+" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:

::&lt;math&gt;x\text{ quus }y= \begin{cases} x+y &amp; \text{for }x,y &lt;57 \\[12pt] 5 &amp; \text{for } x\ge 57 \text{  or  } y\ge57 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

He then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant "+", I had not actually meant ''quus''. Kripke then argues for an interpretation of [[Wittgenstein]] as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.

A '''physical law''' or a '''law of [[physics]]''' is a statement "[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present."&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]]. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.

The distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use "physical law" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists. See Norman Swartz, ''The Concept of Physical Law'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 1985. Second edition available online [https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Several general properties of physical laws have been identified. Physical laws are:

== Examples ==
{{main|List of laws in science}}
{{See also|Scientific laws named after people}}

Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in [[Isaac Newton]]'s theories of (now) [[classical mechanics]], presented in his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', and in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. Other examples of laws of nature include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]], the four laws of [[thermodynamics]], etc.

==Laws as definitions==
Many scientific laws are couched in mathematical terms (e.g. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}, or the [[uncertainty principle]], or the [[principle of least action]], or [[causality]]). While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not "mathematical" laws. (Mathematical laws can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment.)

== Laws being consequences of mathematical symmetries==
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}
Other laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (say, [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[space–time]]). Laws are constantly being checked experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed.

Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies can be said to generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations (see below), to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.

Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].

The [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].

One strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.

== Laws as approximations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Physical law]] --&gt;
Some laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, Newtonian dynamics (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.

== History ==
Compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature fill the role played by [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.

The observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes—such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena—to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.

In Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.&lt;blockquote&gt;The formula "law of nature" first appears as "a live metaphor" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,&lt;ref&gt;in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, "When Nature Got its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley, "When Nature Got Its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[René Descartes]] described "nature" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts "are to be attributed to nature. The rules according to which these changes take place I call the 'laws of nature'."&lt;ref name="bertie.ccsu.edu7"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmological Revolution V: Descartes and Newton | website=bertie.ccsu.edu | url=http://bertie.ccsu.edu/naturesci/Cosmology/Cosmo5Newton.html | accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The modern [[scientific method]] which took shape at this time (with [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) aimed at total separation of science from theology, with minimal speculation about [[metaphysics]] and ethics. [[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).

== Other fields ==
Some [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.

Examples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius–Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as "laws". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.

In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of humanity''' states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of humanity was named by [[Richard Grandy]] (then an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]) who first expressed it in 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">The '''self-model''' is the central concept in the theory of [[consciousness]] called the '''self-model theory of subjectivity''' ('''SMT'''). This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of [[consciousness]] and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR).&lt;ref name="pmid18166398"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzinger T. |title=Empirical perspectives from the self-model theory of subjectivity: a brief summary with examples |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=168 |pages=215–45 |year=2008 |pmid=18166398 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)68018-2 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-53050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Metzinger]] advanced the theory in his 1993 book ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell'' (Subject and self-model).&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1993). ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell''. Paderborn: Schoningh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the PSM==
The PSM is an entity that “actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future- for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain”. Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, “a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,” or the idea of ownership.&lt;ref name="Being No One"&gt;Being No One&lt;/ref&gt; The second is perspectivalness, which is “a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole”.&lt;ref&gt;Being No one&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is “the phenomenal target property” or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first person perspective as the “existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to our perceived objects and ourselves. We are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe we are perceiving reality directly when in actuality we are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are “transparent” so that we can introspect on our representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves.  These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the Phenomenal Model of Intentionality Relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a “conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The model is a result of the combination of our unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, our unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and our unique positions in space that give our perception perspectivalness.

==Role of the prefrontal cortex==
The prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the [[parietal lobe]]s, unity and the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10487788"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vogeley K. |author2=Kurthen M. |author3=Falkai P. |author4=Maier W. |title=Essential functions of the human self model are implemented in the prefrontal cortex |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=343–63 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10487788 |doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to psychopathology==
Disorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[depersonalization]]. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to [[theory of mind]] deficits and [[weak central coherence theory]]. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benific sense extreme in [[narcissism]].&lt;ref name="pmid10993669"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ben Shalom D |title=Developmental depersonalization: the prefrontal cortex and self-functions in autism |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=457–60 |date=September 2000 |pmid =10993669 |doi=10.1006/ccog.2000.0453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In [[decision theory]], the '''sure-thing principle''' states that a decision maker who would take a certain action if he knew that event ''E'' has occurred, and also if he knew that the negation of ''E'' has occurred, should also take that same action if he knows nothing about ''E''.

The principle was coined by [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|L.J. Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954), ''The foundations of statistics''. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=A businessman contemplates buying a certain piece of property. He considers the outcome of the next presidential election relevant. So, to clarify the matter to himself, he asks whether he would buy if he knew that the Democratic candidate were going to win, and decides that he would. Similarly, he considers whether he would buy if he knew that the Republican candidate were going to win, and again finds that he would. Seeing that he would buy in either event, he decides that he should buy, even though he does not know which event obtains, or will obtain, as we would ordinarily say. It is all  too seldom that a decision can be arrived at on the basis of this principle, but except possibly for the assumption of simple ordering, I know of no other extralogical principle governing decisions that finds such ready acceptance.|source=p. 21}}

He formulated the principle as a [[Strategic dominance|dominance principle]], but it can also be framed probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Jeffrey |jstor=192456 |title=The Sure Thing Principle |journal=Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |volume=2 |year=1982 |pages=719-730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeffrey&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt; and later Pearl&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Savage's principle is only valid when the probability of the event considered (e.g., the winner of the election) is unaffected by the action (buying the property). Under such conditions, the sure-thing principle is a theorem in the ''do''-calculus&lt;ref name=pearl-causality2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Bayes networks]]). Blyth&lt;ref name="blyth-72"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blyth|first1=C.|title=On Simpson's paradox and the sure-thing principle|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=1972|volume=67|pages=364–366|doi=10.2307/2284382}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed a counterexample to the sure-thing principle using sequential sampling in the context of [[Simpson's paradox]], but this example violates the required action-independence provision.&lt;ref name=pearl-2015-r466&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Judea|title=The sure-thing principle|url=http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r466.pdf|website=UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Technical Report R-466|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is closely related to [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]], and equivalent under the axiom of truth (everything the agent knows is true).&lt;ref&gt;Samet, Dov.  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~samet/papers/the-sure-thing-principle.pdf "The sure-thing principle and independence of irrelevant knowledge". Israel Institute of Business Research, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly targeted by the [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] and [[Allais paradox|Allais paradoxes]], in which actual people's choices seem to violate this principle.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey" /&gt;

A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary B. |last=Palmer |title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-292-76569-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[calque]] of the German word '''''[[wikt:Weltanschauung|Weltanschauung]]''''' {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʔanˌʃaʊ.ʊŋ||De-Weltanschauung.ogg}}, composed of ''[[wikt:Welt|Welt]]'' ('world') and ''[[wikt:Anschauung|Anschauung]]'' ('view' or 'outlook').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=worldview |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word is also used in English.

It is a concept fundamental to [[German philosophy]] and [[epistemology]] and refers to a ''wide world perception''. Additionally, it refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the [[world (philosophy)|world]] and interacts with it.

Worldview remains a confused and confusing concept in English, used very differently by [[linguistics|linguists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]]. It is for this reason that James W. Underhill suggests five subcategories: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world, and perspective&lt;ref name =Underhill_2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Humboldt, Worldview and Language|date=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748638420|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Creating worldviews : metaphor, ideology and language|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748679096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107532847}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Worldviews are often taken to operate at a conscious level, directly accessible to  articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level, such as the idea of "[[figure and ground (media)|ground]]" in [[Gestalt psychology]] and [[Media (communication)|media analysis]]. However, core worldview beliefs are often deeply rooted, and so are only rarely reflected on by individuals, and are brought to the surface only in moments of crises of faith.

==Origins==

===Linguistics===
The [[Prussia]]n [[philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) originated the idea that language and worldview are inextricable. Humboldt saw language as part of the creative adventure of mankind. Culture, language and linguistic communities developed simultaneously and could not do so without one another. In stark contrast to [[linguistic determinism]], which invites us to consider language as a constraint, a framework or a prison house, Humboldt maintained that speech is inherently and implicitly creative. Human beings take their place in speech and continue to modify language and thought by their creative exchanges. 

[[Edward Sapir]] (1884–1939) also gives an account of the relationship between thinking and speaking in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fadul |first= Jose |date= 2014 |title= Encyclopedia of Theory and Practice in Psychotherapy and Counseling |url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WRrzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Edward+Sapir+also+gives+an+account+of+the+relationship+between+thinking+and+speaking+in+English&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ObjouuV9rd&amp;sig=RdD1S6ILO_XYWERUl0fB48KL5xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwictcjAoJTRAhVIpI8KHbCdDk4Q6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Sapir%20also%20gives%20an%20account%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20thinking%20and%20speaking%20in%20English&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= 347 |isbn= 978-1-312-34920-9 |author-link= | quote = Edward Sapir also gives an account of the significant relationship between thinking and speaking in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[linguistic relativity]] [[hypothesis]] of [[Benjamin Whorf|Benjamin Lee Whorf]] (1897–1941) describes how the syntactic-semantic structure of a language becomes an underlying structure for the world view or ''Weltanschauung'' of a people through the organization of the causal [[perception]] of the world and the linguistic [[categorization]] of entities. As linguistic categorization emerges as a representation of worldview and causality, it further modifies social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between [[language]] and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 679389 |pages= 65–79 |last1= Kay |first1= P. |last2= Kempton |first2= W. |title= What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis? |volume= 86 |issue= 1 |journal= American Anthropologist |year= 1984 |doi= 10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf's hypothesis became influential in the late 1940s, but declined in prominence after a decade. In the 1990s, new research gave further support for the linguistic relativity theory in the works of [[Stephen Levinson]] (1947–) and his team at the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max Planck institute]] for [[psycholinguistics]] at [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory has also gained attention through the work of [[Lera Boroditsky]] at Stanford University.

===''Weltanschauung'' and cognitive philosophy===

One of the most important concepts in cognitive [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive sciences]] is the German concept of ''Weltanschauung''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This expression has often been used to refer to the "wide worldview" or "wide world perception" of a people, family, or person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The ''Weltanschauung'' of a people originates from the unique world experience of a people, which they experience over several millennia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}The [[language]] of a people reflects the ''Weltanschauung'' of that people in the form of its [[Syntax|syntactic structures]] and untranslatable [[connotation]]s and its [[denotation]]s.

The term ''Weltanschauung'' is often wrongly attributed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of German ethnolinguistics. However, as Jürgen Trabant points out, and as James W. Underhill reminds us, Humboldt's key concept was ''Weltansicht''.&lt;ref name=Underhill_2009/&gt; ''Weltansicht'' was used by Humboldt to refer to the overarching conceptual and sensorial apprehension of reality shared by a linguistic community (Nation). On the other hand, ''Weltanschauung'', first used by Kant and later popularized by Hegel, was always used in German and later in English to refer more to philosophies, ideologies and cultural or religious perspectives, than to linguistic communities and their mode of apprehending reality.

A worldview can be expressed as the "fundamental cognitive, affective, and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things, and which they use to order their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, Paul G. Transforming Worldviews: an anthropological understanding of how people change. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If it were possible to draw a [[map]] of the [[world]] on the basis of ''Weltanschauung'',&lt;ref name="Whorf" &gt;{{cite book|author-last=Whorf|author-first=Benjamin Lee|author-link=Benjamin Lee Whorf|editor-last=Carroll|editor-first=John Bissell|editor-link=John Bissell Carroll|origyear=1st pub. 1956 |year=1964|title=Language, Thought, and Reality.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22map+or+plan+of+an+actual+realm+of+ideas%22 25], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22stock+of+conceptions+common+to+people%22 36], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;q=%22environmental+conditions%22 29-30], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=%22language+family%22 242], [https://books.google.com/books?id=W2d1Q4el00QC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=music 248].&lt;/ref&gt; it would probably be seen to cross political borders—''Weltanschauung'' is the product of [[political]] borders and common experiences of a people from a [[geographical]] region,&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt; [[natural environment|environmental]]-[[climatic]] conditions, the economic resources available, socio-cultural [[system]]s, and the [[Language families and languages|language family]].&lt;ref name="Whorf"/&gt; (The work of the [[Population genetics|population geneticist]] [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] aims to show the gene-[[historical linguistics|linguistic]] co-[[evolution]] of people).

If the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is correct, the worldview map of the world would be similar to the linguistic map of the world. However, it would also almost coincide with a map of the world drawn on the basis of [[music]] across people.&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt;

===Folk-epics===
{{See also|List of world folk-epics}}

As natural language becomes manifestations of world [[perception]], the [[literature]] of a people with common ''Weltanschauung'' emerges as holistic [[representation (psychology)|representations]] of the wide world perception of the people. Thus the extent and commonality between world folk-epics becomes a manifestation of the commonality and extent of a worldview.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Epic poems]] are shared often by people across political borders and across generations. Examples of such epics include the [[Nibelungenlied]] of the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] people, the [[Iliad]] for the Ancient Greeks and Hellenized societies, the [[Silappadhikaram]] of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] of the Hindus, the [[Gilgamesh]] of the [[Mesopotamia]]n-[[Sumer]]ian [[civilization]] and the people of the [[Fertile Crescent]] at large, [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]] (Arabian nights) of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]] epic of the [[Mandé]] people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Terror management theory===
{{Main article|Terror management theory}}
A worldview, according to [[terror management theory]] (TMT), serves as a buffer against death anxiety.&lt;ref name="worm"&gt;Schimel, J., Hayes, J., Williams, T., &amp; Jahrig, J. (2007). ''Is Death Really the Worm at the Core? Converging Evidence that Worldview Threat Increases Death-Thought Accessibility''. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 92, No. 5'', pp. 789-803.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that living up to the ideals of one's worldview provides a sense of self-esteem which provides a sense of transcending the limits of human life (e.g. literally, as in religious belief in immortality, symbolically, as in art works or children to live on after one's death, or in contributions to one's culture).&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Evidence in support of terror management theory includes a series of experiments by Jeff Schimel and colleagues in which a group of Canadians found to score highly on a measure of patriotism were asked to read an essay attacking the dominant Canadian worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Using a test of [[Terror management theory#Death thought accessibility|death-thought accessibility]] (DTA), involving an ambiguous word completion test (e.g. "COFF__" could either be completed as either "COFFEE" or "COFFIN" or "COFFER"), participants who had read the essay attacking their worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of DTA than the control group, who read a similar essay attacking Australian cultural values. Mood was also measured following the worldview threat, to test whether the increase in death thoughts following worldview threat were due to other causes, for example, anger at the attack on one's cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; No significant changes on mood scales were found immediately following the worldview threat.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

To test the generalisability of these findings to groups and worldviews other than those of nationalistic Canadians, Schimel ''et al'' conducted a similar experiment on a group of religious individuals whose worldview included that of [[creationism]].&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Participants were asked to read an essay which argued in support of the theory of evolution, following which the same measure of DTA was taken as for the Canadian group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Religious participants with a creationist worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of death-thought accessibility than those of the control group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Goldenberg ''et al'' found that highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals increases death-thought accessibility, as does attention to the physical rather than meaningful qualities of sex.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., Cox, C. R., Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., &amp; Solomon, S. (2002). ''Understanding human ambivalence about sex: The effects of stripping sex of meaning.'' Journal of Sex Research, 39, 310–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The term World View denotes a comprehensive set of opinions, seen as an [[organic unity]], about the world as the medium and exercise of human existence. World View serves as a framework for generating various dimensions of human perception and experience like [[knowledge]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[culture]], [[science]] and [[ethics]]. For example, worldview of [[causality]] as ''uni-directional'', ''cyclic'', or ''spiral'' generates a framework of the world that reflects these systems of causality.

===Causality===
An unidirectional view of [[causality]] is present in some monotheistic views of the world with a beginning and an end and a single great force with a single end (e.g., [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), while a cyclic worldview of causality is present in religious traditions which are cyclic and seasonal and wherein events and experiences recur in systematic patterns (e.g., [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Hinduism]]). These worldviews of causality not only underlie religious traditions but also other aspects of thought like the purpose of [[history]], [[politics|political]] and [[economics|economic]] theories, and systems like [[democracy]], [[authoritarianism]], [[anarchism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

The worldview of a [[linear]] and [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]] causality generates various related/conflicting disciplines and approaches in [[scientific thinking]]. The ''Weltanschauung'' of the temporal contiguity of act and event leads to underlying diversifications like ''determinism'' vs. ''free will''. A worldview of [[free will]] leads to disciplines that are governed by simple laws that remain constant and are static and [[empirical]] in scientific method, while a worldview of [[determinism]] generates disciplines that are governed with [[dynamical systems|generative systems]] and [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] in [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] and [[materialism]] reject the validity of entities inaccessible to [[natural science]]. They view the [[scientific method]] as the most reliable model for [[model (abstract)|building]] an [[understanding]] of the [[world]].

==Religion==
[[Nishida Kitaro]] wrote extensively on "the Religious Worldview" in exploring the philosophical significance of Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed Kitaro's final book is ''Last Writings: Nothingness and the Religious Worldview''
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neo-Calvinist]] [[David Naugle]]'s ''World view: The History of a Concept'', "Conceiving of Christianity as a worldview has been one of the most significant developments in the recent history of the church."&lt;ref&gt;David K. Naugle ''Worldview: The History of a Concept'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4761-7}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian thinker [[James W. Sire]] defines a worldview as "a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart, that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially true, or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently) about the basic construction of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being." He suggests that "we should all think in terms of worldviews, that is, with a consciousness not only of our own way of thought but also that of other people, so that we can first understand and then genuinely communicate with others in our pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;James W. Sire ''The Universe Next Door: A Basic World view Catalog'' p15–16 (text readable at Amazon.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The commitment mentioned by James W. Sire can be extended further. The worldview increases the commitment to serve the world. With the change of a person's view towards the world, he/she can be motivated to serve the world. This serving attitude has been illustrated by Tareq M Zayed as the 'Emancipatory Worldview' in his writing "History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/9631989/History_of_emancipatory_worldview_of_Muslim_learners|title=History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question mentioned above - on whether the super-smart machines, that is, any ''[[Superintelligence|superintelligences]]'', as expected by some, could have worldviews - is interesting in this context and this would influence human worldviews. 

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Belief system}}

The philosophical importance of worldviews became increasingly clear during the 20th century for a number of reasons, such as increasing contact between cultures, and the failure of some aspects of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project, such as the [[rationalist]] project of attaining all truth by reason alone. [[Mathematical logic]] showed that fundamental choices of [[axioms]] were essential in deductive reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Not just in the obvious sense that you need axioms to prove anything, but the fact that for example the [[Axiom of choice]] and [[Axiom S5]], although widely regarded as correct, were in some sense optional.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, even having chosen axioms not everything that was true in a given [[logical system]] could be proven.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]] and discussion in e.g. [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]]'s ''The Freedom of the Will''&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe the problems extend to "the inconsistencies and failures which plagued the Enlightenment attempt to identify universal moral and rational principles";&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[Alister McGrath]] in ''[[The Science of God]]'' p 109 citing in particular [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' – he also cites [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Enlightenment principles such as [[universal suffrage]] and the [[universal declaration of human rights]] are accepted, if not taken for granted, by many.&lt;ref&gt;"Governments in a democracy do not grant the fundamental freedoms enumerated by Jefferson; governments are created to protect those freedoms that every individual possesses by virtue of his or her existence. In their formulation by the Enlightenment philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, inalienable rights are God-given natural rights. These rights are not destroyed when civil society is created, and neither society nor government can remove or "alienate" them."[http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm US Gov website on democracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190718/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of relativity]] offers a Weltanschauung that is revolting to [[absolute space and time]], yet provides a context for modern theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]]. In a book review for a new undergraduate textbook on relativity by [[Wolfgang Rindler]], Kenneth Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jacobs (1970) "Bridging the gap between relativity and the undergraduate", [[Physics Today]] 23(12):48,8 {{doi|10.1063/1.3021868}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "during the post-[[Sputnik]] era, [[special relativity]] began to take its rightful place in the undergraduate curriculum". On the adoption of the Weltanschauung, he notes, "The historical impact of any world picture is ... partly attributable to the zeal of the promulgators and to the efficacy of their teachings."

Philosophers also distinguish the manifest image from the scientific image. These phrases are due to the American 20th century philosopher [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. This is one angle on the ancient philosophical distinction between appearance and reality which is particularly pertinent to everyday contemporary living. Indeed, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} believe that the scientific image, with its reductionist methodology, will undermine our sense of individual freedom and responsibility. So, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} worry that as science advances, particularly cognitive neuroscience, we will be dehumanized. This certainly has powerful Nietzschean undertones. When our immediately given, manifest ([[sc.]] obvious) self-conception is shaken, what is lost for the individual and society? And does it have to be that way?&lt;ref&gt;see Owen Flanagan's 'The Problem of the Soul', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some questions well worth working on, then, are those concerning the refinement of the manifest view of such centrally important concepts such as free will,&lt;ref&gt;see especially Daniel Dennett's 'Freedom Evolves', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the self and individuality, and the possibility of real or lived meaning.

== Characteristics ==
While [[Leo Apostel]] and his followers clearly hold that individuals can construct worldviews, other writers regard worldviews as operating at a [[community]] level, or in an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] way. For instance, if one's worldview is fixed by one's language, as according to a strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], one would have to learn or invent a new language in order to construct a new worldview.

According to Apostel,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diederik Aerts]], [[Leo Apostel]], Bart de Moor, Staf Hellemans, Edel Maex, Hubert van Belle &amp; Jan van der Veken (1994) "[http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf "World views. From Fragmentation to Integration]" VUB Press. Translation of (Apostel and Van der Veken 1991) with some additions. – The basic book of World Views, from the Center Leo Apostel.&lt;/ref&gt; a worldview is an [[ontology]], or a descriptive [[Mental model|model]] of the world. It should comprise these six elements:
# An [[explanation]] of the world
# A [[futurology]], answering the question "Where are we heading?"
# Values, answers to [[ethical]] questions: "What should we do?"
# A [[praxeology]], or [[methodology]], or theory of [[Action (philosophy)|action]]: "How should we attain our goals?"
# An [[epistemology]], or theory of [[knowledge]]: "What is [[truth|true]] and false?"
# An [[etiology]]. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks", its origins and construction.

== Classification of cultural worldviews ==
From across the world across all of the cultures, Roland Muller has suggested that cultural world views can be broken down into three separate world views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher = Xlibris; 1st edition

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not simple enough to say that each person is one of these three cultures. Instead, each individual is a mix of the three. For example, a person may be raised in a Power–Fear society, in an Honor–Shame family, and go to school under a Guilt–Innocence system.

=== Guilt–Innocence ===
In a Guilt–Innocence focused culture, schools focus on deductive reasoning, cause and effect, good questions, and process. Issues are often seen as black and white. Written contracts are paramount. Communication is direct, and can be blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Three Colors of Worldview
| website = KnowledgeWorkx
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honor–Shame ===
Societies with a predominantly Honor–Shame worldview teach children to make honorable choices according to the situations they find themselves in. Communication, interpersonal interaction, and business dealings are very relationship-driven, with every interaction having an effect on the Honor–Shame status of the participants. In an Honor–Shame society the crucial objective is to avoid shame and to be viewed honorably by other people. The Honor–Shame paradigm is especially strong in most regions of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power–Fear ===
Some cultures can be seen very clearly in operating under a Power–Fear worldview. In these cultures it is very important to assess the people around you and know where they fall in line according to their level of power. This can be used for good or for bad. A benevolent king rules with power and his citizens fully support him wielding that power. On the converse, a ruthless dictator can use his power to create a [[culture of fear]] where his citizens are oppressed.

==Streams in contemporary American thought==

According to [[Michael Lind]], "a worldview is a more or less coherent understanding of the nature of reality, which permits its holders to interpret new information in light of their preconceptions. Clashes among worldviews cannot be ended by a simple appeal to facts. Even if rival sides agree on the facts, people may disagree on conclusions because of their different premises." This is why politicians often seem to talk past one another, or ascribe different meanings to the same events. Tribal or national wars are often the result of incompatible worldviews. Lind has organized American political worldviews into five categories:
* [[Green politics|Green]] [[Malthusianism]] synthesizes mystical versions of [[environmentalism]] with alarm about population growth in the tradition of the Rev. Thomas Malthus
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[Isolationism]] would abandon foreign alliances, dismantle most of its military, and return to a 19th-century pattern of decentralized government and an economy based on small businesses and small farms.
* [[Neoliberal]] [[Globalism]] believes that at home governments should provide only basic public goods like infrastructure and security, and do so by market-friendly methods
* [[populism|Populist]] [[Nationalism]] tends to favor restriction of legal as well as illegal [[immigration]] to protect the core stock of the tribe-state from dilution by different races, ethnic groups or religions. Populist nationalism also tends to favor [[protectionist]] policies that shield workers and businesses, particularly small businesses, from foreign competition.
* [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] claims an economic safety net, protecting citizens from unemployment, sickness, poverty in old age and other disasters, is necessary if democratic government is to retain popular support.
Lind argues that even though not all people will fit neatly into only one category or the other, their core worldview shape how they frame their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Lind |title=The five worldviews that define American politics |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/12/lind_five_worldviews/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon Magazine]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and comparison==
One can think of a worldview as comprising a number of [[basic belief]]s which are philosophically equivalent to the axioms of the worldview considered as a logical theory. These basic beliefs cannot, by definition, be proven (in the logical sense) within the worldview precisely because they are [[axiom]]s, and are typically argued ''from'' rather than argued ''for''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Daniel Hill and Randal Rauser ''Christian Philosophy A–Z'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2152-1}} p200&lt;/ref&gt; However their coherence can be explored philosophically and logically.

If two different worldviews have sufficient common beliefs it may be possible to have a constructive dialogue between them.&lt;ref&gt;In the Christian tradition this goes back at least to [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogues with Trypho, A Jew'', and has roots in the debates recorded in the [[New Testament]] For a discussion of the long history of religious dialogue in India, see [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''The Argumentative Indian''
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if different worldviews are held to be basically incommensurate and irreconcilable, then the situation is one of [[cultural relativism]] and would therefore incur the standard criticisms from [[philosophical realist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cog-rel.htm#H5 ''Cognitive Relativism'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem of self-refutation is quite general. It arises whether truth is relativized to a framework of concepts, of beliefs, of standards, of practices.[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/relativism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on Relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, religious believers might not wish to see their beliefs relativized into something that is only "true for them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=49207 Pope Benedict warns against relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM Ratzinger, J. ''Relativism, the Central Problem for Faith Today'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Subjective logic]] is a belief-reasoning formalism where beliefs explicitly are subjectively held by individuals but where a consensus between different worldviews can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|journal=International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=9|issue=3|pages=279–311|doi=10.1142/S0218488501000831|last1=Jøsang|first1=Audun|title=A Logic For Uncertain Probabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third alternative sees the worldview approach as only a methodological relativism, as a suspension judgment about the truth of various belief systems but not a declaration that there is no global truth. For instance, the religious philosopher [[Ninian Smart]] begins his ''Worldviews: Cross-cultural Explorations of Human Beliefs'' with "Exploring Religions and Analysing Worldviews" and argues for "the neutral, dispassionate study of different religious and secular systems—a process I call worldview analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ninian Smart]] ''Worldviews: Crosscultural Explorations of Human Beliefs (3rd Edition)'' {{ISBN|0-13-020980-5}} p14
&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison of religious, philosophical or scientific worldviews is a delicate endeavor, because such worldviews start from different [[presupposition]]s and cognitive values. Clément Vidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x|author=Vidal, Clément}}
&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed metaphilosophical criteria for the comparison of worldviews, classifying them in three broad categories:

# ''objective'': objective consistency, scientificity, scope
# ''subjective'': subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality
# ''intersubjective'': intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity

David Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962016344|title=SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND WORLD VIEWS.|last=BELL|first=DAVID|date=2016|publisher=GROSVENOR House PUBLISHING|isbn=9781786237668|location=Guildford, Surrey, UK|oclc=962016344}}&lt;/ref&gt; has raised interesting questions on worldviews for the designers of [[Superintelligence|superintelligences]] – machines much smarter than humans. &amp;nbsp;'Would they need worldviews, where would they get their worldviews and what would they be like?'. The answers would have to relate to, for example, Christian worldviews. Some of the people who consider features of superintelligences say they will have characteristics that are often associated with divinity, raising big open questions for Christian believers. For example, very advanced machines could, perhaps, &amp;nbsp; ultimately engender in people a terrified reverence and mystical awe in the light of, say, an artificial agent's impressive understanding of the human condition. And perhaps some humans might even be induced to 'worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator'? On the other hand what would the agent's relationship to God be? Anyone attempting to accommodate concepts such as an omnipotent, personal creator's sacrificial, emotional, spiritual and attitudinal demands being made of any man-made entity, superintelligent or not, could be said to have strayed into ''terra prohibita'' theologically, of course. And how would the worldviews of any superintelligences handle the relationships with what it might regard as its ''human'' 'creator'?
